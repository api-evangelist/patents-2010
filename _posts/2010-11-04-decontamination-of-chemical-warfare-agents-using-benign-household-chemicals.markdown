This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 11 933 607 filed on Nov. 1 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 829 519 which claimed priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 890 773 filed Feb. 20 2007 incorporated herein in its entirety.

The invention relates to methods using hydrogen peroxide and or ammonia from household chemicals to decontaminate materials which have been contaminated with nerve and mustard chemical warfare agents. The composition is generally non toxic to handling personnel prior to its use as a decontaminant for chemical warfare agents and can be conveniently made.

Over many years various highly toxic chemical and biological warfare agents have been developed and stockpiled by several nations. These weapons are very efficient in causing multiple casualties and cannot easily be detected making their production and eventual deployment difficult to monitor. In addition these weapons cost relatively little to produce and are easy to manufacture. In view of the hazards associated with these agents it is essential to have formulations which can rapidly and efficiently decontaminate surfaces which have been exposed to these chemical and biological warfare agents. Rapid decontamination minimizes downtime for soldiers operating within a contaminated area.

Several types of toxic chemical compounds are known. These include mustard and nerve agents. Mustard agents or gases also called blister agents may be nitrogen or chlorinated sulfur compounds. The most common type of mustard agents are the chlorinated sulfur compounds. Long after mustard gas was discovered in 1822 it was used in World War I as a chemical warfare agent causing approximately 400 000 casualties. The sulfur mustard gas is chemically known as bis chloroethyl sulfide. The nitrogen mustard gas is chemically known as tris 2 chloroethyl amine. Mustard gas is a colorless oily liquid having a garlic or horseradish odor. It is slightly soluble in water complicating removal by washing. It primarily attacks humans through inhalation and dermal contact having an Airborne Exposure Limit AEL of 0.003 mg m3. Mustard gas is a vesicant and an alkylating agent which produces a cytotoxic reaction to the hematopoietic tissues. Symptoms usually begin to take effect 4 to 24 hours after initial contact. The rate of detoxification of mustard gas is slow and repeated exposure yields a cumulative effect.

Nerve agents or gases were discovered in 1936 during research on more effective pesticides. Nerve agents inhibit a certain enzyme within the human body from destroying a substance called acetylcholine. This produces a nerve signal within the body forcing the muscles to contract. Nerve agents have an Airborne Exposure Limit AEL of 0.00001 mg m.

An important aspect of any containment strategy is to be able to neutralize the threat using chemical decontamination methods. Most chemical warfare agents CWA s and biological warfare agents BWA s can be destroyed or rendered harmless by suitable chemical treatments. Unfortunately existing chemical treatments for neutralization of biological and chemical agents have significant drawbacks. Universal formulations are desired that can decontaminate all biological and chemical threats in all environments and on all surfaces. Existing decontamination solutions may only be effective against a certain class of agents. Although basic peroxide has been shown to decontaminate GD and GB it does not individually affect HD because of both its insolubility in aqueous media and its slow reaction with OOH. It has been reported in Catalytic Activation of Hydrogen Peroxide A Green Oxidant System by Russell S. Drago Karen M. Frank George Wagner and Yu Chu Yang in Proceedings of the 1997 ERDEC Scientific Conference on chemical and Biological Defense Research ERDEC SP 063 Aberdeen Proving Grounds Maryland July 1998 pp. 341 342 that bicarbonate ion dramatically enhances the oxidation of HD by peroxide in water t BuOH media via generation of the highly reactive peroxocarbonate HCO4.

To be effective emergency response personnel may need several types of decontaminants available on hand. Use of existing decontaminants under inappropriate conditions can result in the formation of dangerous by products. For example a dilute bleach solution is very effective at destroying anthrax spores but an extremely toxic by product is formed if used to destroy VX. Furthermore some chemicals such as sodium hydroxide dissolved in organic solvents are unsuitable for use in certain conditions because they corrode etch or erode materials.

Today many different types of CWA s and BWA s are known. The CWA s fall into three main classes sulfur mustards HD nitrogen mustards HN and organophosphorous nerve agents acetylcholinesterase inhibitors of the G GA GB GD GE GF and V VX VE VG VM type. BWA s can be classified into at least five categories viruses bacteria rickettsia biological toxins and genetically engineered agents.

Most decontamination processes include some form of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of CWA s creates intermediates or by products of organophosphorous compounds that are sometimes more toxic than the agent itself. While hydrolysis may be acceptable for many organophosphorous compounds it is not universally effective against all of these compounds and great care must be taken to first identify then treat the agent under the proper hydrolyzing conditions.

The oxidation of neutral organo phosphorous esters OPEs usually involves atoms other than phosphorus. In compounds containing sulfur oxidation generally occurs at the sulfur atom. In unprotected nitrogen moieties oxidation at nitrogen will occur and may result in increased inhibition of acetylcholine esterase. From a toxicological standpoint random oxidation of organophosphorous compounds at critical sites could result in the production of better esterase inhibitors.

These considerations highlight the need for a system capable of decontaminating a broad range of chemical and biological agents without producing toxic by products. In addition there is a need for a decontamination system that is compatible with most common materials easy to dispense and environmentally safe.

Chemical Warfare Agents are exceedingly toxic and must be decontaminated following either attacks military or terrorist or accidental spills. Porous surfaces such as concrete are most difficult to decontaminate as the chemical agents become sorbed into the material where they remain contact and vapor hazards for extended periods of time.

Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal reactive material for decontamination especially in the environment since it decomposes to yield harmless environmentally friendly oxygen and water. Moreover no residue is left behind following its use.

It is well known that G agents are easily and quickly decontaminated by both dilute base and basic hydrogen peroxide as disclosed in Wagner et al. Decontamination of VX GD and HD on a Surface Using Modified Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide Langmuir 2007 23 1178 1186 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Ammonia NH a gas is known to form basic solutions when dissolved in water. Further it is widely used as a fertilizer in agriculture and as the active ingredient in household cleaning products see below and is the active ingredient in smelling salts. In fact ammonia s potent distinct aroma has been experienced by practically everyone and is quite recognizable.

Current peroxide based decontaminants are DF200 and DECON GREEN. DECON GREEN is a reactive universal decontaminant for VX HD and G agents composed of bicarbonate baking soda hydrogen peroxide alcohol and or other ingredients as disclosed by Wagner et al Feasibility of Formulating DECON GREEN with Aircraft Deicing Fluid VX GD and HD Reactivity Geo Centers Inc. Aberdeen Proving Ground MD Report No. A897234 Contract No. DAAM01 98 C 0008 Report Date January 2005 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A method of use of DECON GREEN decontaminant is also covered by U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957 claims a method of neutralizing chemical warfare agents comprising the steps of providing a composition comprising a mixture of potassium bicarbonate a solid urea hydrogen peroxide component and an alcohol component wherein said alcohol is selected from the group consisting of ethanol isopropanol propylene glycol polypropylene glycol and derivates thereof and contacting a chemical warfare agent with said composition.

However current peroxide based decontaminants such as DF200 and DECON GREEN require industrial strength concentrations of aqueous hydrogen peroxides i.e. 8 to 35 . Thus these decontaminants are hazardous to store ship and handle requiring caution on the part of the end user. In addition to the hydrogen peroxide component such decontaminants utilize many other ingredients with which the typical end user has no prior experience or knowledge. Being able to formulate efficacious decontaminants with benign items used by people in everyday life and which are readily available at any supermarket would have obvious advantages.

The common chemical warfare agents for which decontaminants are routinely used to demonstrate efficacy are the nerve agents VX and GD and the blister agent HD. GD being water soluble and easily decontaminated by dilute base is perhaps the easiest to destroy. Although VX is also water soluble like GD it cannot be decontaminated by dilute base as the toxic EA 2192 byproduct is formed. EA 2192 is S 2 diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothioic acid.

Basic peroxide which contains the particularly reactive peroxyanion OOH species is much more effective against VX as formation of EA 2192 is eliminated by use of this reactant. HD is water insoluble but can be slowly hydrolyzed in water with sufficient and prolonged agitation. Yet a much faster method for decontaminating HD is via single oxidation to its non vesicant sulfoxide which can be very fast compared to hydrolysis. However care must be taken to perform the oxidation selectively so as to not further oxidize the sulfoxide to the vesicant sulfone. Fortunately dilute hydrogen peroxide possesses the needed selectivity to initially selectively oxidize HD to the sulfoxide avoiding formation of the sulfone.

It is an object of the present invention to provide from household products an environmentally safe decontamination solution for chemical warfare agents such as nerve agents and HD.

It is the subject of this invention to formulate very efficacious decontaminants based solely on common everyday household chemicals ammonia window cleaner floor cleaner rubbing alcohol baking soda washing soda and topical e.g. 3 HO i.e. the concentration commonly employed as a antiseptic on skin and cuts abrasions to decontaminate GB GD VX and HD via the aforementioned reactions.

The present invention provides an ammonia based composition for detoxifying and removing a chemical warfare agent from a surface comprising a mixture of 

a solution of ammonia and water having an ammonia concentration of 0.1 to 75 wt. preferably 0.1 to 10 wt. 

a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water having a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.1 to 3.0 wt. and

optionally at least one member of the group consisting of a solution of isopropyl alcohol and water having an isopropyl alcohol content of 0.1 to 70 wt baking soda and washing soda 

wherein the final composition of the mixture has an ammonia concentration of 0.1 to 25 wt. and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.1 to 2.9 wt. or 0.1 to 2.7 wt. .

The present invention also provides a hydrogen peroxide based composition for detoxifying and removing a chemical warfare agent from a surface comprising a mixture of 

a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water having a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.1 to 3.0 wt. and

Additional features of the present invention include the unanticipated decontamination effectiveness of low hydrogen peroxide concentrations provided by household 3 hydrogen peroxide. U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957 shows usage of much higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations 11 26 which were always thought to be required for efficacy in the prior art and these levels cannot be attained by using household 3 hydrogen peroxide thus higher hazardous concentrations of hydrogen peroxide would have to be employed if one followed the teachings of the prior art. The current invention shows that efficacy can actually be achieved at much lower hydrogen peroxide concentrations i.e. 3 or less employing relatively non hazardous and benign household 3 hydrogen peroxide solution. Thus an additional feature is being able to get everything you need to make the decontaminant compositions at a supermarket. It is not possible to do this with the prior art examples of U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957.

In a second embodiment of the composition the present invention provides a hydrogen peroxide based composition for detoxifying and removing a chemical warfare agent from a surface comprising a mixture of 

a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water having a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.1 to 3.0 wt. and at least one member selected from the group consisting of a solution of isopropyl alcohol and water having an isopropyl alcohol content of 0.1 to 70 wt baking soda and washing soda.

The present invention further includes a method for neutralizing chemical warfare agents comprising the steps of 

an aqueous solution of ammonia and water having an ammonia concentration of 0.1 to 75 wt. wherein the composition has an ammonia concentration of 0.05 to 75 wt and

The components are all made from household chemicals and effective to degrade a chemical warfare agent and contacting the mixture with a chemical warfare agent.

The present invention also relates to a method of neutralizing chemical warfare agents comprising the steps of 

an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and water having a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.1 to 3.0 wt. and

an aqueous solution of isopropyl alcohol and water having an isopropyl alcohol content of 0.1 to 70 wt 

Using hydrogen peroxide advantageously avoids waste or residue following decontamination as hydrogen peroxide self decomposes into water and oxygen which can simply be released to the environment. According to the present invention topical hydrogen peroxide e.g. 3 can be incorporated into a variety of benign household mixtures such as window cleaners e.g. ammonia based floor cleaners.

The household cleaning compositions are typically those for cleaning industrial and domestic hard surfaces or fabrics. Cleaning compositions may contain surfactants solvents for example alcohol to possibly facilitate drying sequestering agents and bases or acids to adjust the pH. The surfactants are generally nonionic and anionic combinations or nonionic and cationic combinations.

In the most preferred form the present invention includes a solution of household strength ammonia topical hydrogen peroxide baking soda and rubbing alcohol to rapidly decontaminate chemical warfare agents such as VX GB and HD. Preferably washing soda substitutes for baking soda to make a composition for decontaminating VX.

Unless otherwise indicated when molar mass is referred to the reference will be to the weight average molar mass expressed in g mol. The latter can be determined by aqueous gel permeation chromatography GPC or by light scattering DLS or alternatively MALLS with an aqueous eluent or an organic eluent for example dimethylacetamide dimethylformamide and the like depending on the composition of the polymer.

The present invention is a chemical warfare agent decontamination composition and method for neutralizing chemical warfare agents. It is particularly effective against nerve and mustard agent especially VX GB GD and HD chemical agents. The composition includes a mixture of household products. More particularly the present invention is a chemical warfare agent decontaminating composition comprising an aqueous mixture of household products to provide an ammonia component and or a peroxide component effective to degrade a chemical warfare agent and made from household chemicals.

The pH of the composition or the pH of use of the compositions according to the invention can vary depending on the applications and the surfaces to be treated from 5.0 to 10.5 preferably from 7.0 to 9.5.

Thus the invention provides various compositions made from common household chemicals for decontaminating surfaces. The following household chemicals combined or used alone as in the case of GD with ammonia cleaners can be used to effectively decontaminate VX GD and HD.

Floor cleaner ammonia based these cleaners typically are solutions having an ammonia concentration of about 10 weight or less.

Window cleaner ammonia based these cleaners typically have a lower ammonia concentration than the upper limit for floor cleaners

Rubbing alcohol rubbing alcohols typically are solutions having an isopropyl alcohol concentration of 50 to 70 weight for example 60 to 70 weight . Rubbing alcohol typically is an aqueous 70 solution of 2 propanol.

Topical hydrogen peroxide topical hydrogen peroxide typically is a solution having an HOconcentration of 1.0 to 3.0 weight for example 1.5 to 3.0 weight most commonly about 3 weight .

A. Ammonia based window cleaner or floor cleaner by themselves are effective to decontaminate GD. Advantageously these household chemicals also leave no residue.

B. Mixtures of ammonia based window cleaner or floor cleaner with topical strength hydrogen peroxide are effective against GD and VX. However preferably a mixture of ammonia based floor cleaner with topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution is effective against GD and VX. Preferably a mixture of about 25 to about 75 wt. floor cleaner and about 25 to about 75 topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution is employed percentages based on weight of the overall composition . For example a 50 50 wt. mixture of floor cleaner and topical 3 hydrogen peroxide is particularly effective against GD and VX. Advantageously these household chemicals also leave no residue.

C. Mixtures of topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution and rubbing alcohol solution are effective against HD. Preferably a mixture of about 25 to about 75 wt. topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution and about 25 to about 75 rubbing alcohol solution is employed percentages based on weight of the overall composition . For example a 50 50 wt. mixture of a topical 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and a rubbing alcohol solution is particularly effective against HD. With an appropriate dose this can result in a half life for HD of about 36 minutes. Advantageously these household chemicals also leave no residue.

D. Mixtures of topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution and rubbing alcohol solution with baking soda are more effective against HD. Preferably a mixture of about 25 to about 75 wt. topical strength 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and about 25 to about 75 wt. rubbing alcohol solution is employed with about 1.0 to about 5.0 wt. baking soda percentages based on weight of the overall composition . For example a 50 50 weight ratio mixture of topical 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and rubbing alcohol solution with 2 wt. baking soda baking soda weight based on weight of the overall composition is particularly effective against HD. With an appropriate dose this can result in a half life for HD of about 8 minutes. This generally leaves a baking soda residue. The combination of the carbonate and peroxide generate a peroxocarbonate according to the equilibrium reaction of formula I 

The reaction of HD with peroxocarbonate to non vesicant sulfoxide HDO avoiding formation of the vesicant sulfone HDO is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957 incorporated herein by reference.

E. Mixtures of topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution and baking soda are effective against GD with limited reactivity for VX. Preferably a mixture of about 50 to about 100 wt. topical strength 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and about 1.0 to about 10.0 wt. baking soda percentages based on weight of the overall composition is employed. For example a topical 3 hydrogen peroxide solution with 5 wt. baking soda baking soda weight based on weight of the overall composition is effective against GD with limited reactivity for VX. This generally leaves a baking soda residue.

Reaction of the peroxyanion OOH from hydrogen peroxide with VX by a perhydrolysis mechanism is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 957 incorporated herein by reference.

F. Mixtures of topical strength hydrogen peroxide solution and washing soda are effective against GD and VX. Preferably a mixture of about 50 to about 100 wt. topical strength typically about 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and about 0.5 to about 2.0 wt. washing soda percentages based on weight of the overall composition is employed. For example a topical 3 hydrogen peroxide solution with 1 wt. washing soda washing soda weight based on weight of the overall composition is effective against GD and VX. This generally leaves a washing soda residue.

Preferably the mixture comprises a blended liquefied combination of the components. A blended liquefied combination of the components provides the mixed compounds as uniformly dispersed together within the mixture.

Where only liquid components are involved they are simply stirred together with no special procedure required. For the HD specific decontamination composition D it is best to first dissolve the baking soda into the topical 3 hydrogen peroxide prior to adding the rubbing alcohol. For decontamination compositions E and F the baking soda and washing soda are simply dissolved in the topical hydrogen peroxide with stirring.

The composition according to the invention can be provided in any form and can be used in multiple ways. The term composition may include without limitation sprays vapors liquids solids and or other physical forms of mixtures that incorporate the household strength carbonate peroxide and alcohol components as a unitary decontaminant.

The compositions are typically applied at dosages expressed as challenge rates of 1 part contaminant 50 parts decontaminant to 1 part contaminant 100 parts decontaminant.

The surfaces can be made of any material for example ceramic glass metal synthetic resins e.g. melamine or formica surfaces painted surfaces or plastics.

The decontaminating composition according to the invention is compatible with other additives commonly in household products. For example the decontaminating composition according to the invention additionally may comprise at least one surface active agent such as a surfactant. The latter can be nonionic anionic amphoteric zwitterionic or cationic.

For an efficacious decontaminant it is desirable to decontaminate a 1 50 challenge of agent within 15 min i.e. 50 mL of decontaminant should decontaminate 1 mL of agent challenge preferably within 15 or 30 min. Thus this challenge level and time frame is employed to demonstrate the invention.

GD is easily decontaminated by dilute base as disclosed by Langmuir 2007 23 1178 1186 published on web Dec. 5 2006 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Innocuous ammonia containing window and floor cleaners are rendered basic owing to their dissolved ammonia. According to the present invention these household products used full strength or as is were found to be quite effective for GD decontamination as shown in TABLE 1 where 1 50 reactions of GD with two window cleaners and one floor cleaner were carried out. The floor cleaner containing a higher concentration of dissolved ammonia as indicated by its much greater pungent ammonia aroma is particularly effective destroying the entire GD challenge within 5 min. The ingredients were only the window and floor cleaners themselves straight out of the bottle full strength and undiluted.

The Floor Cleaner was ACME Brand SIMPLY CLEAN Clear Ammonia available from Albertsons Inc. Boise Id. 83726 having an ammonia concentration of about 10 wt. .

Window Cleaner 1 was ACME brand window cleaner Simply Clean with Ammonia available from Albertsons Inc. Boise Id. 83726. It is believed it had a lower ammonia concentration than the floor cleaner.

Window Cleaner 2 was WINDEX Glass Cleaner with Ammonia D available from S.C. Johnson Sons Inc. Racine Wis. 53403. It is believed it had a lower ammonia concentration than the floor cleaner.

Although ammonia based cleaners are very effective against GD they do not adequately decontaminate VX and HD. TABLE 1 also shows the results of 1 50 reactions of the floor cleaner with VX and HD. A water control reaction was also run with a 1 50 HD challenge to determine if the floor cleaner offered any efficacy beyond that of plain water. Although VX was reduced to 75.9 7.6 of the toxic EA 2192 formed in addition to 16.5 of the desired non toxic EMPA product. Thus ammonia based cleaners alone are not effective decontaminants for VX because of EA 2192 formation. For HD 92.9 remained after 15 minutes compared to 86.4 for the water control. Thus the floor cleaner is not more effective than water alone both of which are poor decontaminants for HD when time is of the essence.

As shown in Example 1 the floor cleaner alone is not adequate to decontaminate VX owing to formation of the toxic EA 2192 byproduct. However it can be employed to activate topical 3 HO thus generating the active peroxyanion OOH species previously discussed. It was discovered that a simple 50 50 mixture of floor cleaner with topical 3 HOis extremely effective against a 1 50 challenge of VX as shown in TABLE 2. Also shown in TABLE 2 is the reaction of a 1 50 challenge of GD with the same mixture showing that it is particularly effective for this nerve agent similarly functioning much better than the floor cleaner alone. Finally an attempt at reacting a 1 50 challenge of HD with the same mixture resulted in no detectable decontamination products after 15 minutes. Thus unlike the nerve agents this mixture is not effective against HD. It is important to note that such simple mixtures of non residue leaving floor cleaner and household HOalso form a non residue leaving decontaminant effective for these nerve agents. Thus a non residue leaving decontaminant would afford the same benefits as a non residue leaving cleaner no labor intensive rinsing is required and no deposits owing to the decontaminant itself would remain in floors walls ceilings vehicle aircraft interiors etc.

Hydrogen peroxide may be used to oxidize HD to its non vesicant sulfoxide. Bicarbonate ion HCO such as that contained in baking soda NaHCO may be employed as an activator to form the monoperoxocarbonate HCO species which is a more potent oxidant for HD than HOitself. However a co solvent is needed to dissolve HD into solution to facilitate the reaction. Rubbing alcohol which is an aqueous 70 solution of 2 propanol is particularly effective at dissolving HD. Thus a 50 50 mixture of rubbing alcohol with topical 3 HOis able to dissolve and react with 1 100 and 1 50 challenges of HD. These reactions are shown in TABLE 3. Note the ability of baking soda bicarbonate activator to dramatically enhance the rate of reaction even against the higher 1 50 challenge. Further note that the reactions for HD with half lives on the order of several to tens of minutes are not nearly as fast as those previously shown above for GD and VX where half lives tend to be significantly less than one minute. Thus HD would take longer than 15 min to destroy. The reaction could be enhanced by using greater concentrations of HO e.g. 8 and higher but this is contrary to the intent of this invention to employ only household materials to generate decontaminants.

Harrison St. Princeton N.J. 08543 Alcohol 70 Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol Diamond Products Seffner Fla. 33584 and Hydrogen Peroxide 3 H2O2 U.S.P Topical Anti Infective Cumberland Swan Smyrna Tenn. 37167.

Besides generating peroxomonocarbonate in the presence of HO baking soda also generates peroxyanion. Moreover washing soda NaCO is even more efficient at generating OOH owing to its inherent greater basicity. However washing soda does not generate appreciable amounts of peroxomonocarbonate the formation of which is favored near neutral pH. Thus baking soda and especially washing soda may also be employed to activate topical 3 HOfor GD and VX decontamination. However note that these mixtures unlike the ammonia activated solutions mentioned above would leave residues of the baking washing soda. Being particularly benign baking soda would present a quite innocuous residue but a residue nonetheless. Note that washing soda with its higher inherent pH would present a more irritating residue than baking soda but much less is required about the amount compared to baking soda to completely decontaminate 1 50 challenges of GD and VX. TABLE 4 shows reactions of 1 50 challenges of GD and VX with baking soda topical 3 HOsolutions.

The products employed in this example were as follows ARM HAMMER SUPER WASHING SODA DETERGENT BOOSTER AND HOUSEHOLD CLEANER contains sodium carbonate Arm Hammer Div. of Church and Dwight Co. Inc. 469 N. Harrison St. Princeton N.J. 08543 and the same Baking Soda discussed above.

The decontamination of 1 50 challenges of GD VX and HD employing mixtures of simple household materials such as ammonia containing window and floor cleaners topical 3 HO rubbing alcohol baking soda and washing soda is demonstrated. In particular mixtures of floor cleaner and topical 3 HOare useful for GD and VX decontamination as they do not leave any residue nor require rinsing following their use. Thus this decontaminant would be particularly useful against GD and VX contamination inside buildings subways vehicles ships aircraft and the like. The effective HD decontaminant composed of baking soda rubbing alcohol and topical 3 H2O2 would leave only innocuous baking soda as its sole residue perhaps an acceptable residue for most applications. Rather than the composition of this example if avoidance of residues is of utmost concern and time is not of the essence a simple residue free 50 50 mixture of rubbing alcohol and topical 3 . HOcan afford decontamination of HD to its non vesicant sulfoxide.

NH itself affords a good stand alone solution phase decontaminant for GD. Conveniently NH containing household cleaners are readily available and two brands of window cleaners and one floor cleaner were selected for study. Generally it is desirable for a decontaminant to decontaminate a 1 50 agent challenge within 15 minutes i.e. 50 mL of decontaminant should be able to decontaminate at least 1 mL of agent within this time frame. Simple NMR experiments were employed using 0.75 mL of the cleaners to which 15 L of GD was added to follow the reaction kinetics assess the extent of reaction and identify the product s . These results are summarized in TABLE 5.

At the end of 15 minutes both window cleaners contained significant amounts of GD. However the floor cleaner decontaminates GD to below detectable levels within 15 min. The pH of the floor cleaner is 12 significantly higher than that of the window cleaners both pH 10 . Thus its higher pH and perfectly acceptable performance for GD decontamination are consistent with it possessing a higher NHconcentration.

As another demonstration of the efficacy of NH based cleaners for surface decontamination of GD single 0.5 L drops of GD were deposited on 24 mm glass wool disks decontaminated with various amounts of floor cleaner or window cleaner for 15 minutes immediately extracted with CDCN and analyzed by NMR. The results are shown in TABLE 6.

The floor cleaner still possessed superior capacity for GD compared to window cleaner 2 and it was able to decontaminate the disk to below detectable levels within 15 minutes with as little as 0.5 mL. Yet complete decontamination using the latter was also achievable simply by increasing its amount to 1.5 mL.

In view of the above it should be apparent that embodiments other than those expressly described above come within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus the present invention is not limited by the above provided description but rather is defined by the claims appended hereto.
