The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for heating and producing hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations. Embodiments relate to heater patterns and production well locations for treating hydrocarbon containing formations.

Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources as feedstocks and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery processing and or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids composition changes solubility changes density changes phase changes and or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be but is not limited to a gas a liquid an emulsion a slurry and or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.

Heaters may be placed in wellbores to heat a formation during an in situ process. Examples of in situ processes utilizing downhole heaters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2 634 961 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 732 195 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 780 450 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 789 805 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom and U.S. Pat. No. 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Application of heat to oil shale formations is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom and U.S. Pat. No. 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Heat may be applied to the oil shale formation to pyrolyze kerogen in the oil shale formation. The heat may also fracture the formation to increase permeability of the formation. The increased permeability may allow formation fluid to travel to a production well where the fluid is removed from the oil shale formation. In some processes disclosed by Ljungstrom for example an oxygen containing gaseous medium is introduced to a permeable stratum preferably while still hot from a preheating step to initiate combustion.

A heat source may be used to heat a subterranean formation. Electric heaters may be used to heat the subterranean formation by radiation and or conduction. An electric heater may resistively heat an element. U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments of in situ conversion processes the overburden and or the underburden may include a hydrocarbon containing layer or hydrocarbon containing layers that are relatively impermeable and are not subjected to temperatures during in situ conversion processing that result in significant characteristic changes of the hydrocarbon containing layers of the overburden and or the underburden. For example the underburden may contain shale or mudstone but the underburden is not allowed to heat to pyrolysis temperatures during the in situ conversion process. In some cases the overburden and or the underburden may be somewhat permeable.

 Kerogen is a solid insoluble hydrocarbon that has been converted by natural degradation and that principally contains carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur.

 Rich layers in a hydrocarbon containing formation are relatively thin layers typically about 0.2 m to about 0.5 m thick . Rich layers generally have a richness of about 0.150 L kg or greater. Some rich layers have a richness of about 0.170 L kg or greater of about 0.190 L kg or greater or of about 0.210 L kg or greater. Lean layers of the formation have a richness of about 0.100 L kg or less and are generally thicker than rich layers.

Rich layers have a lower initial thermal conductivity than other layers of the formation. Typically rich layers have a thermal conductivity 1.5 times to 3 times lower than the thermal conductivity of lean layers. In addition rich layers have a higher thermal expansion coefficient than lean layers of the formation.

Hydrocarbons in formations may be treated in various ways to produce many different products. In certain embodiments hydrocarbons in formations are treated in stages. depicts an illustration of stages of heating the hydrocarbon containing formation. also depicts an example of yield Y in barrels of oil equivalent per ton y axis of formation fluids from the formation versus temperature T of the heated formation in degrees Celsius x axis .

Desorption of methane and vaporization of water occurs during stage 1 heating. Heating of the formation through stage 1 may be performed as quickly as possible. For example when the hydrocarbon containing formation is initially heated hydrocarbons in the formation desorb adsorbed methane. The desorbed methane may be produced from the formation. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated further water in the hydrocarbon containing formation is vaporized. Water may occupy in some hydrocarbon containing formations between 10 and 50 of the pore volume in the formation. In other formations water occupies larger or smaller portions of the pore volume. Water typically is vaporized in a formation between 160 C. and 285 C. at pressures of 600 kPa absolute to 7000 kPa absolute. In some embodiments the vaporized water produces wettability changes in the formation and or increased formation pressure. The wettability changes and or increased pressure may affect pyrolysis reactions or other reactions in the formation. In certain embodiments the vaporized water is produced from the formation. In other embodiments the vaporized water is used for steam extraction and or distillation in the formation or outside the formation. Removing the water from and increasing the pore volume in the formation increases the storage space for hydrocarbons in the pore volume.

In certain embodiments after stage 1 heating the formation is heated further such that a temperature in the formation reaches at least an initial pyrolyzation temperature such as a temperature at the lower end of the temperature range shown as stage 2 . Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed throughout stage 2. A pyrolysis temperature range varies depending on the types of hydrocarbons in the formation. The pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between 250 C. and 900 C. The pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may extend through only a portion of the total pyrolysis temperature range. In some embodiments the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may include temperatures between 250 C. and 400 C. or temperatures between 270 C. and 350 C. If a temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is slowly raised through the temperature range from 250 C. to 400 C. production of pyrolysis products may be substantially complete when the temperature approaches 400 C. Average temperature of the hydrocarbons may be raised at a rate of less than 5 C. per day less than 2 C. per day less than 1 C. per day or less than 0.5 C. per day through the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products. Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal gradients around the heat sources that slowly raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range.

The rate of temperature increase through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may inhibit mobilization of large chain molecules in the formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may limit reactions between mobilized hydrocarbons that produce undesired products. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the production of high quality high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.

In some in situ conversion embodiments a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments the desired temperature is 300 C. 325 C. or 350 C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature. Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at the desired temperature. The heated portion of the formation is maintained substantially at the desired temperature until pyrolysis declines such that production of desired formation fluids from the formation becomes uneconomical. Parts of the formation that are subjected to pyrolysis may include regions brought into a pyrolysis temperature range by heat transfer from only one heat source.

In certain embodiments formation fluids including pyrolyzation fluids are produced from the formation. As the temperature of the formation increases the amount of condensable hydrocarbons in the produced formation fluid may decrease. At high temperatures the formation may produce mostly methane and or hydrogen. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated throughout an entire pyrolysis range the formation may produce only small amounts of hydrogen towards an upper limit of the pyrolysis range. After all of the available hydrogen is depleted a minimal amount of fluid production from the formation will typically occur.

After pyrolysis of hydrocarbons a large amount of carbon and some hydrogen may still be present in the formation. A significant portion of carbon remaining in the formation can be produced from the formation in the form of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas generation may take place during stage 3 heating depicted in . Stage 3 may include heating a hydrocarbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation. For example synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400 C. to about 1200 C. about 500 C. to about 1100 C. or about 550 C. to about 1000 C. The temperature of the heated portion of the formation when the synthesis gas generating fluid is introduced to the formation determines the composition of synthesis gas produced in the formation. The generated synthesis gas may be removed from the formation through a production well or production wells.

Total energy content of fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation may stay relatively constant throughout pyrolysis and synthesis gas generation. During pyrolysis at relatively low formation temperatures a significant portion of the produced fluid may be condensable hydrocarbons that have a high energy content. At higher pyrolysis temperatures however less of the formation fluid may include condensable hydrocarbons. More non condensable formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Energy content per unit volume of the produced fluid may decline slightly during generation of predominantly non condensable formation fluids. During synthesis gas generation energy content per unit volume of produced synthesis gas declines significantly compared to energy content of pyrolyzation fluid. The volume of the produced synthesis gas however will in many instances increase substantially thereby compensating for the decreased energy content.

Heat sources are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources may include heaters such as insulated conductors conductor in conduit heaters surface burners nameless distributed combustors and or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources through supply lines . Supply lines may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters may transport fuel for combustors or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation.

When the formation is heated the heat input into the formation may cause expansion of the formation and geomechanical motion. Computer simulations may model formation response to heating. The computer simulations may be used to develop a pattern and time sequence for activating heat sources in the formation so that geomechanical motion of the formation does not adversely affect the functionality of heat sources production wells and other equipment in the formation.

Heating the formation may cause an increase in permeability and or porosity of the formation. Increases in permeability and or porosity may result from a reduction of mass in the formation due to vaporization and removal of water removal of hydrocarbons and or creation of fractures. Fluid may flow more easily in the heated portion of the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity of the formation. Fluid in the heated portion of the formation may move a considerable distance through the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity. The considerable distance may be over 1000 m depending on various factors such as permeability of the formation properties of the fluid temperature of the formation and pressure gradient allowing movement of the fluid. The ability of fluid to travel considerable distance in the formation allows production wells to be spaced relatively far apart in the formation.

Production wells are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments production well includes a heat source. The heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. In some in situ conversion process embodiments the amount of heat supplied to the formation from the production well per meter of the production well is less than the amount of heat applied to the formation from a heat source that heats the formation per meter of the heat source. Heat applied to the formation from the production well may increase formation permeability adjacent to the production well by vaporizing and removing liquid phase fluid adjacent to the production well and or by increasing the permeability of the formation adjacent to the production well by formation of macro and or micro fractures.

More than one heat source may be positioned in the production well. A heat source in a lower portion of the production well may be turned off when superposition of heat from adjacent heat sources heats the formation sufficiently to counteract benefits provided by heating the formation with the production well. In some embodiments the heat source in an upper portion of the production well may remain on after the heat source in the lower portion of the production well is deactivated. The heat source in the upper portion of the well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid.

In some embodiments the heat source in production well allows for vapor phase removal of formation fluids from the formation. Providing heating at or through the production well may 1 inhibit condensation and or refluxing of production fluid when such production fluid is moving in the production well proximate the overburden 2 increase heat input into the formation 3 increase production rate from the production well as compared to a production well without a heat source 4 inhibit condensation of high carbon number compounds Cand above in the production well and or 5 increase formation permeability at or proximate the production well.

Subsurface pressure in the formation may correspond to the fluid pressure generated in the formation. As temperatures in the heated portion of the formation increase the pressure in the heated portion may increase as a result of increased fluid generation and vaporization of water. Controlling rate of fluid removal from the formation may allow for control of pressure in the formation. Pressure in the formation may be determined at a number of different locations such as near or at production wells near or at heat sources or at monitor wells.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations production of hydrocarbons from the formation is inhibited until at least some hydrocarbons in the formation have been pyrolyzed. Formation fluid may be produced from the formation when the formation fluid is of a selected quality. In some embodiments the selected quality includes an API gravity of at least about 20 30 or 40 . Inhibiting production until at least some hydrocarbons are pyrolyzed may increase conversion of heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons. Inhibiting initial production may minimize the production of heavy hydrocarbons from the formation. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and or reduce the life of production equipment.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations hydrocarbons in the formation may be heated to pyrolysis temperatures before substantial permeability has been generated in the heated portion of the formation. An initial lack of permeability may inhibit the transport of generated fluids to production wells . During initial heating fluid pressure in the formation may increase proximate the heat sources . The increased fluid pressure may be released monitored altered and or controlled through one or more heat sources . For example selected heat sources or separate pressure relief wells may include pressure relief valves that allow for removal of some fluid from the formation.

In some embodiments pressure generated by expansion of pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase although an open path to production wells or any other pressure sink may not yet exist in the formation. The fluid pressure may be allowed to increase towards a lithostatic pressure. Fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid approaches the lithostatic pressure. For example fractures may form from heat sources to production wells in the heated portion of the formation. The generation of fractures in the heated portion may relieve some of the pressure in the portion. Pressure in the formation may have to be maintained below a selected pressure to inhibit unwanted production fracturing of the overburden or underburden and or coking of hydrocarbons in the formation.

After pyrolysis temperatures are reached and production from the formation is allowed pressure in the formation may be varied to alter and or control a composition of formation fluid produced to control a percentage of condensable fluid as compared to non condensable fluid in the formation fluid and or to control an API gravity of formation fluid being produced. For example decreasing pressure may result in production of a larger condensable fluid component. The condensable fluid component may contain a larger percentage of olefins.

In some in situ conversion process embodiments pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to promote production of formation fluid with an API gravity of greater than 20 . Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit formation subsidence during in situ conversion. Maintaining increased pressure may facilitate vapor phase production of fluids from the formation. Vapor phase production may allow for a reduction in size of collection conduits used to transport fluids produced from the formation. Maintaining increased pressure may reduce or eliminate the need to compress formation fluids at the surface to transport the fluids in collection conduits to treatment facilities.

Maintaining increased pressure in a heated portion of the formation may surprisingly allow for production of large quantities of hydrocarbons of increased quality and of relatively low molecular weight. Pressure may be maintained so that formation fluid produced has a minimal amount of compounds above a selected carbon number. The selected carbon number may be at most 25 at most 20 at most 12 or at most 8. Some high carbon number compounds may be entrained in vapor in the formation and may be removed from the formation with the vapor. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit entrainment of high carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds in the vapor. High carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds may remain in a liquid phase in the formation for significant time periods. The significant time periods may provide sufficient time for the compounds to pyrolyze to form lower carbon number compounds.

Generation of relatively low molecular weight hydrocarbons is believed to be due in part to autogenous generation and reaction of hydrogen in a portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation. For example maintaining an increased pressure may force hydrogen generated during pyrolysis into the liquid phase within the formation. Heating the portion to a temperature in a pyrolysis temperature range may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation to generate liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids. The generated liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids components may include double bonds and or radicals. Hydrogen H in the liquid phase may reduce double bonds of the generated pyrolyzation fluids thereby reducing a potential for polymerization or formation of long chain compounds from the generated pyrolyzation fluids. In addition Hmay also neutralize radicals in the generated pyrolyzation fluids. Therefore Hin the liquid phase may inhibit the generated pyrolyzation fluids from reacting with each other and or with other compounds in the formation.

Formation fluid produced from production wells may be transported through collection piping to treatment facilities . Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources . For example fluid may be produced from heat sources to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities . Treatment facilities may include separation units reaction units upgrading units fuel cells turbines storage vessels and or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation. In some embodiments the transportation fuel may be jet fuel such as JP 8.

Formation fluid may be hot when produced from the formation through the production wells. Hot formation fluid may be produced during solution mining processes and or during in situ conversion processes. In some embodiments electricity may be generated using the heat of the fluid produced from the formation. Also heat recovered from the formation after the in situ process may be used to generate electricity. The generated electricity may be used to supply power to the in situ conversion process. For example the electricity may be used to power heaters or to power a refrigeration system for forming or maintaining a low temperature barrier. Electricity may be generated using a Kalina cycle or a modified Kalina cycle.

In certain embodiments the support is heat treated at temperatures in a range from about 400 C. to about 1200 C. from about 450 C. to about 1000 C. or from about 600 C. to about 900 C. prior to impregnation with a metal. In some embodiments impregnation aids are used during preparation of the catalyst. Examples of impregnation aids include a citric acid component ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA ammonia or mixtures thereof.

In certain embodiments the materials are mixed until the Columns 6 10 metals are substantially homogeneously dispersed in the support.

In some embodiments the catalyst is heat treated at temperatures from 150 750 C. from 200 740 C. or from 400 730 C. after combining the support with the metal. In some embodiments the catalyst is heat treated in the presence of hot air and or oxygen rich air at a temperature in a range between 400 C. and 1000 C. to remove volatile matter and to convert at least a portion of the Columns 6 10 metals to the corresponding metal oxide.

In other embodiments a catalyst precursor is heat treated in the presence of air at temperatures in a range from 35 500 C. for a period of time in a range from 1 3 hours to remove a majority of the volatile components without converting the Columns 6 10 metals to the corresponding metal oxide. Catalysts prepared by such a method are generally referred to as uncalcined catalysts. When catalysts are prepared in this manner in combination with a sulfiding method the active metals may be substantially dispersed in the support.

Process units as described herein for the production of crude products and or commercial products may be operated at the following temperatures pressures hydrogen source flows liquid stream flows or combinations thereof or operated otherwise as known in the art. Temperatures range from about 200 C. to about 800 C. from about 300 C. to about 700 C. or from about 400 C. to about 600 C. Pressures range from about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa from about 1 MPa to about 12 MPa from about 4 MPa to about 10 MPa or from about 6 MPa to about 8 MPa.

Liquid stream and hydrogen source enter hydrotreating unit . Hydrogen source may be added to liquid stream before entering hydrotreating unit . In some embodiments sufficient hydrogen is present in liquid stream and hydrogen source is not needed. In hydrotreating unit contact of liquid stream with hydrogen source in the presence of one or more catalysts produces liquid stream .

Fractionation may include but is not limited to an atmospheric distillation process and or a vacuum distillation process. Crude products include but are not limited to C Chydrocarbon stream naphtha stream kerosene stream diesel stream VGO stream and bottoms stream . Bottoms stream generally includes hydrocarbons having a boiling point range greater than 538 C. at 0.101 MPa. One or more of the crude products may be sold and or further processed to gasoline or other commercial products.

To enhance the use of the streams produced from formation fluid hydrocarbons produced during fractionation of the liquid stream and hydrocarbon gases produced during separating the process gas may be combined to form hydrocarbons having a higher carbon number. The produced hydrocarbon gas stream may include a level of olefins acceptable for alkylation reactions.

C Chydrocarbon stream produced from fractionation unit and hydrocarbon gas stream enter alkylation unit . In alkylation unit reaction of the olefins in hydrocarbon gas stream for example ethylene and propylene with the alkanes in C Chydrocarbon stream produces hydrocarbon stream .

Hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4 include but are not limited to butanes pentanes hexanes and heptanes.

In some embodiments bottoms stream may be hydrocracked to produce naphtha and or other products. The resulting naphtha may however need fortification to alter the octane level so that the product may be sold commercially as gasoline. Alternatively bottoms stream may be treated in a catalytic cracker to produce high octane naphtha and or feed for an alkylation unit.

In bottoms stream from fractionation unit enters catalytic cracking unit . In catalytic cracking unit contact of bottoms stream with a catalyst under controlled temperatures produces additional C Chydrocarbon stream gasoline stream and additional kerosene stream .

In some embodiments the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed.

Heating a portion of the subsurface formation may cause the mineral structure of the formation to change and form particles. The particles may be dispersed and or become partially dissolved in the formation fluid. The particles may include metals and or compounds of metals from Columns 1 2 and Columns 4 13 of the Periodic Table for example aluminum silicon magnesium calcium potassium sodium beryllium lithium chromium magnesium copper zirconium and so forth . In some embodiments the particles are coated for example with hydrocarbons of the formation fluid. In certain embodiments the particles include zeolites.

A concentration of particles in formation fluid may range from about 1 ppm to about 3000 ppm from about 50 ppm to about 2000 ppm or from about 100 ppm to about 1000 ppm. The size of particles may range from 0.5 micron to about 200 microns from 5 micron to about 150 microns from about 10 microns to about 100 microns or about 20 microns to about 50 microns.

In certain embodiments formation fluid may include a distribution of particles. The distribution of particles may be but is not limited to a trimodal or a bimodal distribution. For example a trimodal distribution of particles may include from about 1 ppm to about 50 ppm of particles with a size of about 5 microns to about 10 microns from about 2 ppm to about 2000 ppm of particles with a size of about 50 microns to about 80 microns and from about 1 ppm to about 100 ppm with a size of about 100 micron to about 200 microns. A bimodal distribution of particles may include from about 1 ppm to 60 ppm of particles with a size of between about 50 and 60 microns and from about 2 ppm to about 2000 ppm of particles with a size between about 100 and 200 microns.

In some embodiments the particles may contact the formation fluid and catalyze formation of compounds having a carbon number of at most 25 at most 20 at most 12 or at most 8. In certain embodiments the zeolitic particles may assist in the oxidation and or reduction of formation fluids to produce compounds not generally found in fluids produced using conventional production methods. Contact of formation fluid with hydrogen in the presence of zeolitic particles may catalyze reduction of double bond compounds in the formation fluid.

In some embodiments all or a portion of the particles in the produced fluid may be removed from the produced fluid. The particles may be removed by using a centrifuge by washing by acid washing by filtration by electrostatic precipitation by froth flotation and or by another type of separation process.

Many wells are needed for treating a hydrocarbon formation using an in situ conversion process. In some embodiments vertical or substantially vertical wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments horizontal or U shaped wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments combinations of horizontal and vertical wells are formed in the formation. Wells may be formed using drilling rigs.

In an embodiment a rig for drilling wells includes equipment on the rig for drilling multiple wellbores simultaneously. The rig may include one or more systems for constructing the wells including drilling fluid handling and cementing of the wells through the overburden drilling to total depth and placing completion equipment such as heaters and casing. The rig may be particularly useful for forming closely spaced wells such as freeze wells.

In some embodiments wells are drilled in sequential stages with different drilling machines. The wells may be barrier wells heater wells production wells production heater wells monitor wells injection wells or other types of wells. A conductor drilling machine may set the conductor of the well. A main hole drilling machine may drill the wellbore to depth. A completion drilling machine may place casing cement tubing cables heaters and perform other well completion tasks. The drilling machines may be on the same location moving 3 to 10 meters between wells for 2 to 3 years. The size and the shape of the drilling machines may not have to meet existing road transportation regulations since once in the field the drilling machines may remain there for the duration of the project. The major components of the drilling machines may be transported to location and assembled there. The drilling machines may not have to be disassembled for a multi mile move for several years.

One or more central plants may support the drilling machines. The use of a central plant may allow for smaller drilling machines. The central plant may include prime movers mud tanks solids handling equipment pipe handling power and other equipment common to the drilling machines. The equipment of the central plant may be coupled to the drilling machines by flexible umbilicals by easily modifiable piping and or by quick release electrical connections. Several wells may be drilled before the need to move the central plant arises. In some embodiments the central plant may be moved while connected to one or more operating drilling machines. The drilling machines and central plant may be designed with integrated drip pans to capture leaks and spills.

In some embodiments the drilling machines are powered directly off the electric grid. In other embodiments the drilling machines are diesel powered. Using diesel power may avoid complications associated with interfering with the installation of electrical and other systems needed for the wells of the in situ conversion process.

The drilling machines may be automated so that little or no human interaction is required. The tubulars used by the drilling machines may be stacked and stored on or by the drilling machines so that the drilling machines can access and manipulate the tubulars with minimal or no human intervention. For example a carousel or other device may be used to store a tubular and move the tubular from storage to the drilling mast. The carousel or other device may also be used to move the tubular from the drilling mast to storage.

The drilling machines may include propulsion units so that the drilling machines do not need to be skidded. The central plant may also include propulsion units. Skidding involves extra equipment not used for drilling the wells and may be complicated by the dense concentration of surface facilities and equipment. In some embodiments the drilling machines and or central plant may include tracks or a walking mechanism to eliminate railroad type tracks. Eliminating railroad type tracks may reduce the amount of pre work road and rail formation that needs to be completed before drilling operations can begin. In some embodiments the propulsion units may include a fixed movement mechanism. The fixed movement mechanism may advance the drilling machine a set distance when activated so that the drilling machine is located at the next well location. Fine adjustment may allow for exact positioning of the drilling machine after initial position location by the fixed movement mechanism.

In some embodiments drilling machines and or the central plant are positioned on a central track or access lane. The drilling equipment may be extended from one side to the other of the central track to form the wells. The drilling machine is able to stay in one place while an arm or cantilever mechanism allows multiples of wells to be drilled around the drilling machine. The wells may be drilled in very close proximity if required.

The drilling machines and the central plant may be self leveling and able to function on up to a 10 grade or higher. In some embodiments the drilling machines include hydraulic and or mechanical leveling systems. The drilling machines and central plant may have ground clearances of at least 1 meter so that the units may be moved unobstructed over wellheads. Each drilling machine may include a mechanism for precisely placing the working components of the drilling machine over the hole center of the well being formed. In some embodiments the mechanism adjusts the position of a derrick of the drilling machine.

The drilling machines may be moved from one well to another with derricks of the drilling machines in upright or inclined positions. The term derrick is used to represent whatever top drive support device is employed on the rig whether the top drive support device is a derrick stiff mast or hydraulic arm. Because some drilling machines may use three 10 m pipe sections the derrick may have to be lowered for rig moves. If the derrick must be lowered lowering and raising the derrick needs to be a quick and safe operation. In some embodiments the derrick is lowered with the bottom hole assembly racked in the derrick to save time handling the bottom hole assembly. In other embodiments the bottom hole assembly is separated from the derrick for servicing during a move of the drilling machine.

In some embodiments one of the drilling machines is able to do more than one stage of well formation. In some embodiments a freeze wall or other barrier is formed around all or a portion of a treatment area. There may be about a year or more of time from when the last freeze well is drilled to the time that main holes for heater and producer wells can be drilled. In the intervening time the drilling machine used to drill the main hole of a well may be used to preset conductors for heater wells and or production wells in the treatment area.

In some embodiments two or more drilling machines are placed on the same carrier. For example the carrier may include equipment that presets the conductor for a well. The carrier may also carry equipment for forming the main hole. One portion of the machine could be presetting a conductor while another portion of the machine could be simultaneously forming the main hole of a second well.

Running drill pipe to replace bits running in down hole equipment and pulling the equipment out after use may be time consuming and expensive. To save time and expense all drilling and completion tools may go into the hole and not come out. For example drill pipe may become casing. Once data is obtained from logging runs the logging tools are left in the hole and drilling proceeds through them or past them if necessary. Downhole equipment is integrated into the drill pipe. In some embodiments the drill pipe becomes a conduit of a conduit in conduit heater.

In some embodiments a retractable drilling assembly is used. Using a retractable drilling assembly may be beneficial when using continuous coiled tubing. When total depth of the well is reached the drill bit and bottom hole assembly may be retracted to a smaller diameter. The drill bit and bottom hole assembly may be brought to the surface through the coiled tubing. The coiled tubing may be left in the hole as casing.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine and the completion drilling machine include a quick connect device for attaching the fluid diverter spool drilling wellhead to the conductor casing. The use of a quick connect device may be faster than threading or welding the diverter to the conductor casing. The quick connect device may be a snap on or clamp on type diverter. Wellheads are typically designed to fit a multitude of casing configurations everything from 48 inch conductor to 2 inch tubing. For an in situ conversion process the wellheads may not need to span such a large casing diameter set or have multiple string requirements. The wellheads may only handle a very limited pipe diameter range and only one or two casing strings. Having a fit for purpose wellhead may significantly reduce the cost of fabricating and installing the wellheads for the wells of the in situ conversion process.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine includes a slickline boom system. The slickline boom system may allow running ranging equipment in a close offset well while drilling the well the drilling machine is positioned over. The use of the slickline boom system on the drilling machine may eliminate the need for additional equipment for employing the ranging equipment.

In some embodiments the conductor drilling machine is a blast hole rig. The blast hole rig may be mounted on a crawler or carrier with metal tracks. Air or gas compression is on board the blast hole rig. Tubulars may be racked horizontally on the blast hole rig. The derrick of the blast hole rig may be adjusted to hole center. The bottom hole drilling assembly of the blast hole rig may be left in the derrick when the blast hole rig is moved. In some embodiments the blast hole rig includes an integral drilling fluid tank solids control equipment and a mist collector. In some embodiments the drilling fluid tank the solids control equipment and or the mist collector is part of the central plant.

During well formation with jointed pipe one time consuming task is making connections. To reduce the number of connections needed during formation of wells long lengths of pipe may be used. In some embodiments the drilling machines are able to use pipe with a length of about 25 m to 30 m. The 25 m to 30 m piping may be made up of two or more shorter joints but is preferably a single joint of the appropriate length. Using a single joint may decrease the complexity of pipe handling and result in fewer potential leak paths in the drill string. In some embodiments the drilling machines use jointed pipe having other lengths such as 20 m lengths or 10 m lengths.

The drilling machine may use a top drive system. In some embodiments the top drive system functions using a rack and pinion. In some embodiments the top drive system functions using a hydraulic system.

The drilling machines may include automated pipe handling systems. The automated pipe handling system may be able to lift pipe make connections and have another joint in the raised position ready for the next connection. The automated pipe handling systems may include an iron roughneck to make and break connections. In some embodiments the pipe skid for the drilling machine is an integral component of the drilling machine.

String floats check valves may be needed in the drill string because air and or liquid will be used during drilling. An integral float valve may be positioned in each joint used by the drilling machine. Including a string float in each joint may minimize circulating times at connections and speed up the connection process.

Drilling the wells may be done at low operating pressures. In some embodiments a quick connect coupler is used to connect drill pipe together because of the low operating pressures. Using quick connect couplers to join drill pipe may reduce drilling time and simplify pipe handling automation.

In certain embodiments the main hole drilling machine is designed to drill 6 inch or 6 inch holes. The pumping capabilities needed to support the main hole drilling machine may include 3 900 scfm air compressors a 2000 psi booster and a liquid pump with an operational maximum of 325 gpm. A 35 gpm pump may also be included if mist drilling is required.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine and or the completion drilling machine uses coiled tubing. Coiled tubing may allow for minimal or no pipe connections above the bottom hole assembly. However the drilling machine still needs the ability to deploy and retrieve the individual components of the bottom hole assembly. In some embodiments components are automatically retrieved by a carousel deployed and made up over the hole when running in the hole. The process may be reversed when tripping out of the hole. Alternatively components may be racked horizontally on the drilling machine. The components may be maneuvered with automatic pipe arms.

The drilling machine may employ a split injector system. When coiled tubing operations are halted the two sides of the injector may be remotely unlatched and retracted to allow for over hole access.

In some embodiments that use coiled tubing a bottom hole assembly handling rig is used to make up and deploy the bottom hole assembly in the well conductor of a well to be drilled to total depth. The drilling machine may leave the current bottom hole assembly in the well after reaching total depth and prior to moving to the next well. After latching on to the bottom hole assembly in the follow up well the bottom hole assembly handling rig may pull the bottom hole assembly from the previous well and prepare it for the next well in sequence. The mast for the bottom hole assembly handling rig may be a very simple arrangement supporting a sandline for bottom hole assembly handling.

A reel used by the drilling machine may have 500 1000 m of pipe. To increase the number of cycles the coiled tubing may be used the reel may have a large diameter and be relatively narrow. In some embodiments the coiled tubing reel is the wellhead. Having the wellhead and the reel as one unit eliminates the additional handling of a separate wellhead and an empty reel.

Wellbores may be formed in the ground using any desired method. Wellbores may be drilled impacted and or vibrated in the ground. In some embodiments wellbores are formed using reverse circulation drilling Reverse circulation drilling may minimize formation damage due to contact with drilling muds and cuttings. Reverse circulation drilling may inhibit contamination of cuttings so that recovered cuttings can be used as a substitute for coring. Reverse circulation drilling may significantly reduce the volume of drilling fluid used to form a wellbore. Reverse circulation drilling enables fast penetration rates and the use of low density drilling fluid. The drilling fluid may be for example air mist water brine or drilling mud. The reduction in volume of drilling fluid may significantly reduce drilling costs. Formation water production is reduced when using reverse circulation drilling Reverse circulation drilling permits use of air drilling without resulting in excessive air pockets being left in the formation. Prevention of air pockets in the formation during formation of wellbores is desirable especially if the wellbores are to be used as freeze wells for forming a barrier around a treatment area.

Reverse circulation drilling systems may include components to enable directional drilling. For example steerable motors bent subs for altering the direction of the borehole or autonomous drilling packages could be included.

Reverse circulation drilling enables fast penetration rates and the use of low density drilling fluid such as air or mist. When tri cone rock bits are used a skirted rock bit assembly replaces the conventional tri cone bit. The skirt directs the drilling fluid from the pipe in pipe drill rod annulus to the outside portion of the hole being drilled. As the cuttings are generated by the action of the rotating drill bit the cuttings mix with the drilling fluid pass through a hole in the center of the bit and are carried out of the hole through the center of the drill rods. When a non skirted drill bit is used a reverse circulation crossover is installed between the standard bit and the drill rods. The crossover redirects the drilling fluid from the pipe in pipe drill rod annulus to the inside of the drill string about a meter above the bit. The drilling fluid passes through the bit jets mixes with the cuttings and returns up the drill string. At the crossover the fluid cuttings mixture enters the drill string and continues to the surface inside the inner tube of the drill rod.

In some embodiments the cuttings generated during drilling are milled and used as a filler material in a slurry used for forming a grout wall. Cuttings that contain hydrocarbon material may be retorted to extract the hydrocarbons. Retorting the cuttings may be environmentally beneficial because the reinjected cuttings are free of organic material. Recovering the hydrocarbons may offset a portion of the milling cost.

When drilling a wellbore a magnet or magnets may be inserted into a first opening to provide a magnetic field used to guide a drilling mechanism that forms an adjacent opening or adjacent openings. The magnetic field may be detected by a 3 axis fluxgate magnetometer in the opening being drilled. A control system may use information detected by the magnetometer to determine and implement operation parameters needed to form an opening that is a selected distance away from the first opening within desired tolerances .

Various types of wellbores may be formed using magnetic tracking. For example wellbores formed by magnetic tracking may be used for in situ conversion processes for steam assisted gravity drainage processes for the formation of perimeter barriers or frozen barriers and or for soil remediation processes. Magnetic tracking may be used to form wellbores for processes that require relatively small tolerances or variations in distances between adjacent wellbores. For example vertical and or horizontally positioned heater wells and or production wells may need to be positioned parallel to each other with relatively little or no variance in parallel alignment to allow for substantially uniform heating and or production from the treatment area in the formation. Also freeze wells need to be positioned parallel to each other with relatively little or no variance in parallel alignment to allow formation of overlapping cold zones that will result in a solid frozen barrier around the treatment area.

In certain embodiments a magnetic string is placed in a vertical well. The magnetic string in the vertical well is used to guide the drilling of a horizontal well such that the horizontal well connects to the vertical well at a desired location passes the vertical well at a selected distance relative to the vertical well at a selected depth in the formation or stops a selected distance away from the vertical well. In some embodiments the magnetic string is placed in a horizontal well. The magnetic string in the horizontal well is used to guide the drilling of a vertical well such that the vertical well connects to the horizontal well at a desired location passes the horizontal well at a selected distance relative to the horizontal well or stops at a selected distance away from the horizontal well.

Analytical equations may be used to determine the spacing between adjacent wellbores using measurements of magnetic field strengths. The magnetic field from a first wellbore may be measured by a magnetometer in a second wellbore. Analysis of the magnetic field strengths using derivations of analytical equations may determine the coordinates of the second wellbore relative to the first wellbore.

Magnet segments may include one or more movable magnets that are magnetizable and demagnetizable using a magnetic coil. Magnetic coil is located at or near the surface of the formation. Magnetic coil is used to magnetize and demagnetize magnetic string . In certain embodiments magnetic string is magnetized by magnetic coil as the string is placed into opening . In an embodiment as magnetic string is removed from opening magnetic coil demagnetizes the magnetic string. Demagnetizing magnetic string as the magnetic string is removed makes the magnetic string safer and more efficient to transport for example shipping to another location or moving to another location or opening in the formation .

In other embodiments magnetic string includes one or more movable permanent longitudinal magnets. A movable permanent longitudinal magnet may have a north pole and a south pole. Magnetic string may have a longitudinal axis that is substantially parallel for example within about 5 within about 10 or within about 15 of parallel or coaxial with a longitudinal axis of opening .

Magnetic strings may be moved for example pushed and or pulled through an opening using a variety of methods. In an embodiment a magnetic string may be coupled to a drill string and moved through the opening as the drill string moves through the opening. Alternatively magnetic strings may be installed using coiled tubing rigs. Some embodiments may include coupling a magnetic string to a tractor system that moves through the opening. Commercially available tractor systems from Welltec Well Technologies Denmark or Schlumberger Technology Co. Houston Tex. U.S.A. may be used. In certain embodiments magnetic strings are pulled by cable or wireline from either end portion of the opening. In an embodiment magnetic strings are pumped through the opening using air and or water. For example a pig may be moved through the opening by pumping air and or water through the opening and the magnetic string may be coupled to the pig.

In some embodiments casing is a conduit. Casing may be made of a material that is not significantly influenced by a magnetic field for example non magnetic alloy such as non magnetic stainless steel for example 304 310 or 316 stainless steel reinforced polymer pipe or brass tubing . The casing may be a conduit of a conductor in conduit heater a perforated liner or a perforated casing. If the casing is not significantly influenced by a magnetic field then the magnetic flux will not be shielded.

In some embodiments the casing is made of a ferromagnetic material for example carbon steel . Ferromagnetic material may have a magnetic permeability greater than about 1. The use of ferromagnetic material may weaken the strength of the magnetic field to be detected by drilling apparatus in adjacent opening . For example carbon steel may weaken the magnetic field strength outside of the casing for example by a factor of 3 depending on the diameter wall thickness and or magnetic permeability of the casing . Measurements may be made with the magnetic string inside the carbon steel casing or other magnetically shielding casing at the surface to determine the effective pole strengths of the magnetic string when shielded by the ferromagnetic material. Measurements of the magnetic field produced by magnetic string in adjacent opening may be used to determine the relative coordinates of adjacent opening to opening .

In some embodiments drilling apparatus includes a magnetic guidance sensor probe. The magnetic guidance sensor probe may contain a 3 axis fluxgate magnetometer and a 3 axis inclinometer. The inclinometer is typically used to determine the rotation of the sensor probe relative to Earth s gravitational field the toolface angle . A general magnetic guidance sensor probe may be obtained from Tensor Energy Products Round Rock Tex. U.S.A. . The magnetic guidance sensor may be placed inside the drilling string coupled to a drill bit. In certain embodiments the magnetic guidance sensor probe is located inside the drilling string of a river crossing rig.

Magnet segments may be placed in conduit . Conduit may be a threaded tubular or seamless tubular. Conduit may be formed by coupling one or more sections . Sections may include non magnetic materials such as but not limited to stainless steel. In certain embodiments conduit is formed by coupling several threaded tubular sections. Sections may have any length desired for example the sections may have a standard length for threaded tubulars . Sections may have a length chosen to produce magnetic fields with selected distances between junctions of opposing poles in magnetic string . The distance between junctions of opposing poles may determine the sensitivity of a magnetic steering method which corresponds to the accuracy in determining the distance between adjacent wellbores. Typically the distance between junctions of opposing poles is chosen to be on the same scale as the distance between adjacent wellbores for example the distance between junctions may be in a range of about 0.5 m to about 750 m of about 1 m to about 500 m or of about 2 m to about 200 m .

Conduit may be a threaded stainless steel tubular. In an embodiment conduit is 2 inch Schedule 40 304 stainless steel tubular formed from 20 ft long sections . With 20 ft long sections the distance between opposing poles will be about 20 ft. In some embodiments sections may be coupled as the conduit is formed and or inserted into opening . Conduit may have a length between about 375 ft and about 525 ft. Shorter or longer lengths of conduit may be used depending on a desired application of the magnetic string.

In an embodiment sections of conduit includes two magnet segments . In an embodiment sections of conduit include only one magnet segment. In some embodiments sections of conduit include more than two magnet segments. Magnet segments may be arranged in sections such that adjacent magnet segments have opposing polarities at the junction of the segments as shown in . In an embodiment one section includes two magnet segments of opposing polarities. The polarity between adjacent sections may be arranged such that the sections have attracting polarities as shown in . Arranging the opposing poles approximate the center of each section may make assembly of the magnet segments in each section relatively easy. In an embodiment the approximate centers of adjacent sections have opposite poles. For example the approximate center of one section may have north poles and the adjacent section or sections on each end of the one section may have south poles as shown in .

Fasteners may be placed at the ends of sections to hold magnet segments in the sections. Fasteners may include but are not limited to pins bolts or screws. Fasteners may be made of non magnetic materials. In some embodiments ends of sections are closed off for example end caps are placed on the ends to enclose magnet segments in the sections. In certain embodiments fasteners are also placed at junctions of opposing poles of adjacent magnet segments to inhibit the adjacent segments from moving apart.

Magnetic strings may include multiple south south and north north opposing pole junctions. As shown in the multiple opposing pole junctions may induce a series of magnetic fields . Alternating the polarity of portions in the magnetic string may provide a sinusoidal variation of the magnetic field along the length of the magnetic string. The magnetic field variations may allow for control of the desired spacing between drilled wellbores. A series of magnetic fields may be detected at greater distances than individual magnetic fields. Increasing the distance between opposing pole junctions in the magnetic string may increase the radial distance at which a magnetometer can detect the magnetic field. In some embodiments the distance between opposing pole junctions in the magnetic string is varied. For example more magnets may be used in portions proximate Earth s surface than in portions positioned deeper in the formation.

Some wellbores formed in the formation may be used to facilitate formation of a perimeter barrier around a treatment area. Heat sources in the treatment area may heat hydrocarbons in the formation within the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be but is not limited to a low temperature or frozen barrier formed by freeze wells dewatering wells a grout wall formed in the formation a sulfur cement barrier a barrier formed by a gel produced in the formation a barrier formed by precipitation of salts in the formation a barrier formed by a polymerization reaction in the formation and or sheets driven into the formation. Heat sources production wells injection wells dewatering wells and or monitoring wells may be installed in the treatment area defined by the barrier prior to simultaneously with or after installation of the barrier.

A low temperature zone around at least a portion of a treatment area may be formed by freeze wells. In an embodiment refrigerant is circulated through freeze wells to form low temperature zones around each freeze well. The freeze wells are placed in the formation so that the low temperature zones overlap and form a low temperature zone around the treatment area. The low temperature zone established by freeze wells is maintained below the freezing temperature of aqueous fluid in the formation. Aqueous fluid entering the low temperature zone freezes and forms the frozen barrier. In other embodiments the freeze barrier is formed by batch operated freeze wells. A cold fluid such as liquid nitrogen is introduced into the freeze wells to form low temperature zones around the freeze wells. The fluid is replenished as needed.

In some embodiments two or more rows of freeze wells are located about all or a portion of the perimeter of the treatment area to form a thick interconnected low temperature zone. Thick low temperature zones may be formed adjacent to areas in the formation where there is a high flow rate of aqueous fluid in the formation. The thick barrier may ensure that breakthrough of the frozen barrier established by the freeze wells does not occur.

Vertically positioned freeze wells and or horizontally positioned freeze wells may be positioned around sides of the treatment area. If the upper layer the overburden or the lower layer the underburden of the formation is likely to allow fluid flow into the treatment area or out of the treatment area horizontally positioned freeze wells may be used to form an upper and or a lower barrier for the treatment area. In some embodiments an upper barrier and or a lower barrier may not be necessary if the upper layer and or the lower layer are at least substantially impermeable. If the upper freeze barrier is formed portions of heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells that pass through the low temperature zone created by the freeze wells forming the upper freeze barrier wells may be insulated and or heat traced so that the low temperature zone does not adversely affect the functioning of the heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells passing through the low temperature zone.

Spacing between adjacent freeze wells may be a function of a number of different factors. The factors may include but are not limited to physical properties of formation material type of refrigeration system coldness and thermal properties of the refrigerant flow rate of material into or out of the treatment area time for forming the low temperature zone and economic considerations. Consolidated or partially consolidated formation material may allow for a large separation distance between freeze wells. A separation distance between freeze wells in consolidated or partially consolidated formation material may be from about 3 m to about 20 m about 4 m to about 15 m or about 5 m to about 10 m. In an embodiment the spacing between adjacent freeze wells is about 5 m. Spacing between freeze wells in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material such as in tar sand may need to be smaller than spacing in consolidated formation material. A separation distance between freeze wells in unconsolidated material may be from about 1 m to about 5 m.

Freeze wells may be placed in the formation so that there is minimal deviation in orientation of one freeze well relative to an adjacent freeze well. Excessive deviation may create a large separation distance between adjacent freeze wells that may not permit formation of an interconnected low temperature zone between the adjacent freeze wells. Factors that influence the manner in which freeze wells are inserted into the ground include but are not limited to freeze well insertion time depth that the freeze wells are to be inserted formation properties desired well orientation and economics.

Relatively low depth wellbores for freeze wells may be impacted and or vibrationally inserted into some formations. Wellbores for freeze wells may be impacted and or vibrationally inserted into formations to depths from about 1 m to about 100 m without excessive deviation in orientation of freeze wells relative to adjacent freeze wells in some types of formations.

Wellbores for freeze wells placed deep in the formation or wellbores for freeze wells placed in formations with layers that are difficult to impact or vibrate a well through may be placed in the formation by directional drilling and or geosteering. Acoustic signals electrical signals magnetic signals and or other signals produced in a first wellbore may be used to guide directionally drilling of adjacent wellbores so that desired spacing between adjacent wells is maintained. Tight control of the spacing between wellbores for freeze wells is an important factor in minimizing the time for completion of barrier formation.

After formation of the wellbore for the freeze well the wellbore may be backflushed with water adjacent to the part of the formation that is to be reduced in temperature to form a portion of the freeze barrier. The water may displace drilling fluid remaining in the wellbore. The water may displace indigenous gas in cavities adjacent to the formation. In some embodiments the wellbore is filled with water from a conduit up to the level of the overburden. In some embodiments the wellbore is backflushed with water in sections. The wellbore maybe treated in sections having lengths of about 6 m 10 m 14 m 17 m or greater. Pressure of the water in the wellbore is maintained below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments the water or a portion of the water is removed from the wellbore and a freeze well is placed in the formation.

Formation refrigerant may flow through cold side conduit from a refrigeration unit to inlet conduit of freeze well . The formation refrigerant may flow through an annular space between inlet conduit and canister to warm side conduit . Heat may transfer from the formation to canister and from the canister to the formation refrigerant in the annular space. Inlet conduit may be insulated to inhibit heat transfer to the formation refrigerant during passage of the formation refrigerant into freeze well . In an embodiment inlet conduit is a high density polyethylene tube. At cold temperatures some polymers may exhibit a large amount of thermal contraction. For example a 260 m initial length of polyethylene conduit subjected to a temperature of about 25 C. may contract by 6 m or more. If a high density polyethylene conduit or other polymer conduit is used the large thermal contraction of the material must be taken into account in determining the final depth of the freeze well. For example the freeze well may be drilled deeper than needed and the conduit may be allowed to shrink back during use. In some embodiments inlet conduit is an insulated metal tube. In some embodiments the insulation may be a polymer coating such as but not limited to polyvinylchloride high density polyethylene and or polystyrene.

Freeze well may be introduced into the formation using a coiled tubing rig. In an embodiment canister and inlet conduit are wound on a single reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces the canister and inlet conduit into the formation. In an embodiment canister is wound on a first reel and inlet conduit is wound on a second reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces canister into the formation. Then the coiled tubing rig is used to introduce inlet conduit into the canister. In other embodiments freeze well is assembled in sections at the wellbore site and introduced into the formation.

An insulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to overburden . An uninsulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to layer or layers where a low temperature zone is to be formed. In some embodiments uninsulated sections of the freeze wells may be positioned adjacent only to aquifers or other permeable portions of the formation that would allow fluid to flow into or out of the treatment area. Portions of the formation where uninsulated sections of the freeze wells are to be placed may be determined using analysis of cores and or logging techniques.

Various types of refrigeration systems may be used to form a low temperature zone. Determination of an appropriate refrigeration system may be based on many factors including but not limited to a type of freeze well a distance between adjacent freeze wells a refrigerant a time frame in which to form a low temperature zone a depth of the low temperature zone a temperature differential to which the refrigerant will be subjected one or more chemical and or physical properties of the refrigerant one or more environmental concerns related to potential refrigerant releases leaks or spills economic factors awater flow in the formation composition and or properties of formation water including the salinity of the formation water and one or more properties of the formation such as thermal conductivity thermal diffusivity and heat capacity.

A circulated fluid refrigeration system may utilize a liquid refrigerant formation refrigerant that is circulated through freeze wells. Some of the desired properties for the formation refrigerant are low working temperature low viscosity at and near the working temperature high density high specific heat capacity high thermal conductivity low cost low corrosiveness and low toxicity. A low working temperature of the formation refrigerant allows a large low temperature zone to be established around a freeze well. The low working temperature of formation refrigerant should be about 20 C. or lower. Formation refrigerants having low working temperatures of at least 60 C. may include aqua ammonia potassium formate solutions such as Dynalene HC 50 Dynalene Heat Transfer Fluids Whitehall Pa. U.S.A. or FREEZIUM Kemira Chemicals Helsinki Finland silicone heat transfer fluids such as Syltherm XLT Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. U.S.A. hydrocarbon refrigerants such as propylene and chlorofluorocarbons such as R 22. Aqua ammonia is a solution of ammonia and water with a weight percent of ammonia between about 20 and about 40 . Aqua ammonia has several properties and characteristics that make use of aqua ammonia as the formation refrigerant desirable. Such properties and characteristics include but are not limited to a very low freezing point a low viscosity ready availability and low cost.

Formation refrigerant that is capable of being chilled below a freezing temperature of aqueous formation fluid may be used to form the low temperature zone around the treatment area. The following equation the Sanger equation may be used to model the time tneeded to form a frozen barrier of radius R around a freeze well having a surface temperature of T 

In these equations kis the thermal conductivity of the frozen material cand care the volumetric heat capacity of the frozen and unfrozen material respectively ris the radius of the freeze well vis the temperature difference between the freeze well surface temperature Tand the freezing point of water T vis the temperature difference between the ambient ground temperature Tand the freezing point of water T L is the volumetric latent heat of freezing of the formation R is the radius at the frozen unfrozen interface and Ris a radius at which there is no influence from the refrigeration pipe. The Sanger equation may provide a conservative estimate of the time needed to form a frozen barrier of radius R because the equation does not take into consideration superposition of cooling from other freeze wells. The temperature of the formation refrigerant is an adjustable variable that may significantly affect the spacing between freeze wells.

EQN. 1 implies that a large low temperature zone may be formed by using a refrigerant having an initial temperature that is very low. The use of formation refrigerant having an initial cold temperature of about 30 C. or lower is desirable. Formation refrigerants having initial temperatures warmer than about 30 C. may also be used but such formation refrigerants require longer times for the low temperature zones produced by individual freeze wells to connect. In addition such formation refrigerants may require the use of closer freeze well spacings and or more freeze wells.

The physical properties of the material used to construct the freeze wells may be a factor in the determination of the coldest temperature of the formation refrigerant used to form the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Carbon steel may be used as a construction material of freeze wells. ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys and ASTM A333 grade 3 steel alloys may be used for low temperature applications. ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys typically contain little or no nickel and have a low working temperature limit of about 50 C. ASTM A333 grade 3 steel alloys typically contain nickel and have a much colder low working temperature limit. The nickel in the ASTM A333 grade 3 alloy adds ductility at cold temperatures but also significantly raises the cost of the metal. In some embodiments the coldest temperature of the refrigerant is from about 35 C. to about 55 C. from about 38 C. to about 47 C. or from about 40 C. to about 45 C. to allow for the use of ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys for construction of canisters for freeze wells. Stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel may be used to form freeze wells but the cost of stainless steel is typically much more than the cost of ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloy.

In some embodiments the metal used to form the canisters of the freeze wells may be provided as pipe. In some embodiments the metal used to form the canisters of the freeze wells may be provided in sheet form. The sheet metal may be longitudinally welded to form pipe and or coiled tubing. Forming the canisters from sheet metal may improve the economics of the system by allowing for coiled tubing insulation and by reducing the equipment and manpower needed to form and install the canisters using pipe.

A refrigeration unit may be used to reduce the temperature of formation refrigerant to the low working temperature. In some embodiments the refrigeration unit may utilize an ammonia vaporization cycle. Refrigeration units are available from Cool Man Inc. Milwaukee Wis. U.S.A. Gartner Refrigeration Manufacturing Minneapolis Minn. U.S.A. and other suppliers. In some embodiments a cascading refrigeration system may be utilized with a first stage of ammonia and a second stage of carbon dioxide. The circulating refrigerant through the freeze wells may be 30 by weight ammonia in water aqua ammonia . Alternatively a single stage carbon dioxide refrigeration system may be used.

The high stage refrigeration system includes compressor condenser expansion valve and heat exchanger . In some embodiments the high stage refrigeration system uses ammonia as the refrigerant. The low stage refrigeration system includes compressor heat exchanger expansion valve and heat exchanger . In some embodiments the low stage refrigeration system uses carbon dioxide as the refrigerant. High stage refrigerant from high stage expansion valve cools low stage refrigerant exiting low stage compressor in heat exchanger .

Low stage refrigerant exiting low stage expansion valve is used to cool formation refrigerant in heat exchanger . The formation refrigerant passes from heat exchanger to storage vessel . Pump transports formation refrigerant from storage vessel to freeze wells in formation . Refrigeration system is operated so that the formation refrigerant from pump is at the desired temperature. The desired temperature may be in the range from about 35 C. to about 55 C.

Formation refrigerant passes from the freeze wells to storage vessel . Pump is used to transport the formation refrigerant from storage vessel to heat exchanger . In some embodiments storage vessel and storage vessel are a single tank with a warm side for formation refrigerant returning from the freeze wells and a cold side for formation refrigerant from heat exchanger .

In some embodiments a double barrier system is used to isolate a treatment area. The double barrier system may be formed with a first barrier and a second barrier. The first barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the treatment area to inhibit fluid from entering or exiting the treatment area. The second barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the first barrier to isolate an inter barrier zone between the first barrier and the second barrier. The double barrier system may allow greater project depths than a single barrier system. Greater depths are possible with the double barrier system because the stepped differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier is less than the differential pressure across a single barrier. The smaller differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier make a breach of the double barrier system less likely to occur at depth for the double barrier system as compared to the single barrier system.

The double barrier system reduces the probability that a barrier breach will affect the treatment area or the formation on the outside of the double barrier. That is the probability that the location and or time of occurrence of the breach in the first barrier will coincide with the location and or time of occurrence of the breach in the second barrier is low especially if the distance between the first barrier and the second barrier is relatively large for example greater than about 15 m . Having a double barrier may reduce or eliminate influx of fluid into the treatment area following a breach of the first barrier or the second barrier. The treatment area may not be affected if the second barrier breaches. If the first barrier breaches only a portion of the fluid in the inter barrier zone is able to enter the contained zone. Also fluid from the contained zone will not pass the second barrier. Recovery from a breach of a barrier of the double barrier system may require less time and fewer resources than recovery from a breach of a single barrier system. For example reheating a treatment area zone following a breach of a double barrier system may require less energy than reheating a similarly sized treatment area zone following a breach of a single barrier system.

The first barrier and the second barrier may be the same type of barrier or different types of barriers. In some embodiments the first barrier and the second barrier are formed by freeze wells. In some embodiments the first barrier is formed by freeze wells and the second barrier is a grout wall. The grout wall may be formed of cement sulfur sulfur cement or combinations thereof. In some embodiments a portion of the first barrier and or a portion of the second barrier is a natural barrier such as an impermeable rock formation.

The inter barrier zone may have a thickness from about 1 m to about 300 m. In some embodiments the thickness of the inter barrier zone is from about 10 m to about 100 m or from about 20 m to about 50 m.

Pumping monitor wells may be positioned in contained zone inter barrier zones and or outer zone outside of second barrier . Pumping monitor wells allow for removal of fluid from treatment area inter barrier zones or outer zone . Pumping monitor wells also allow for monitoring of fluid levels in treatment area inter barrier zones and outer zone .

In some embodiments a portion of treatment area is heated by heat sources. The closest heat sources to first barrier may be installed a desired distance away from the first barrier. In some embodiments the desired distance between the closest heat sources and first barrier is in a range between about 5 m and about 300 m between about 10 m and about 200 m or between about 15 m and about 50 m. For example the desired distance between the closest heat sources and first barrier may be about 40 m.

After sealing treatment area fluid levels in a given fluid bearing zone may be changed so that the fluid head in inter barrier zone and the fluid head in outer zone are different. The amount of fluid and or the pressure of the fluid in individual fluid bearing zones may be adjusted after first barrier and second barrier are formed. The ability to maintain different amounts of fluid and or pressure in fluid bearing zones may indicate the formation and completeness of first barrier and second barrier . Having different fluid head levels in treatment area fluid bearing zones in inter barrier zone and in the fluid bearing zones in outer zone allows for determination of the occurrence of a breach in first barrier and or second barrier . In some embodiments the differential pressure across first barrier and second barrier is adjusted to reduce stresses applied to first barrier and or second barrier or stresses on certain strata of the formation.

Some fluid bearing zones may contain native fluid that is difficult to freeze because of a high salt content or compounds that reduce the freezing point of the fluid. If first barrier and or second barrier are low temperature zones established by freeze wells the native fluid that is difficult to freeze may be removed from fluid bearing zones in inter barrier zone through pumping monitor wells . The native fluid is replaced with a fluid that the freeze wells are able to more easily freeze.

In some embodiments pumping monitor wells may be positioned in treatment area inter barrier zone and or outer zone . Pumping monitor wells may be used to test for freeze completion of frozen barriers and or for pressure testing frozen barriers and or strata. Pumping monitor wells may be used to remove fluid and or to monitor fluid levels in treatment area inter barrier zone and or outer zone . Using pumping monitor wells to monitor fluid levels in contained zone inter barrier zone and or outer zone may allow detection of a breach in first barrier and or second barrier . Pumping monitor wells allow pressure in treatment area each fluid bearing zone in inter barrier zone and each fluid bearing zone in outer zone to be independently monitored so that the occurrence and or the location of a breach in first barrier and or second barrier can be determined.

In some embodiments fluid pressure in inter barrier zone is maintained greater than the fluid pressure in treatment area and less than the fluid pressure in outer zone . If a breach of first barrier occurs fluid from inter barrier zone flows into treatment area resulting in a detectable fluid level drop in the inter barrier zone. If a breach of second barrier occurs fluid from the outer zone flows into inter barrier zone resulting in a detectable fluid level rise in the inter barrier zone.

A breach of first barrier may allow fluid from inter barrier zone to enter treatment area . depicts breach in first barrier of double barrier containment system . Arrow indicates flow direction of fluid from inter barrier zone to treatment area through breach . The fluid level in fluid bearing zone proximate breach of inter barrier zone falls to the height of the breach.

Path allows fluid to flow from breach to the bottom of treatment area increasing the fluid level in the bottom of the contained zone. The volume of fluid that flows into treatment area from inter barrier zone is typically small compared to the volume of the treatment area. The volume of fluid able to flow into treatment area from inter barrier zone is limited because second barrier inhibits recharge of fluid into the affected fluid bearing zone. In some embodiments the fluid that enters treatment area may be pumped from the treatment area using pumping monitor wells in the treatment area. In some embodiments the fluid that enters treatment area may be evaporated by heaters in the treatment area that are part of the in situ conversion process system. The recovery time for the heated portion of treatment area from cooling caused by the introduction of fluid from inter barrier zone is brief. The recovery time may be less than a month less than a week or less than a day.

Pumping monitor wells in inter barrier zone may allow assessment of the location of breach . When breach initially forms fluid flowing into treatment area from fluid bearing zone proximate the breach creates a cone of depression in the fluid level of the affected fluid bearing zone in inter barrier zone . Time analysis of fluid level data from pumping monitor wells in the same fluid bearing zone as breach can be used to determine the general location of the breach.

When breach of first barrier is detected pumping monitor wells located in the fluid bearing zone that allows fluid to flow into treatment area may be activated to pump fluid out of the inter barrier zone. Pumping the fluid out of the inter barrier zone reduces the amount of fluid that can pass through breach into treatment area .

Breach may be caused by ground shift. If first barrier is a low temperature zone formed by freeze wells the temperature of the formation at breach in the first barrier is below the freezing point of fluid in inter barrier zone . Passage of fluid from inter barrier zone through breach may result in freezing of the fluid in the breach and self repair of first barrier .

A breach of the second barrier may allow fluid in the outer zone to enter the inter barrier zone. The first barrier may inhibit fluid entering the inter barrier zone from reaching the treatment area. depicts breach in second barrier of double barrier system . Arrow indicates flow direction of fluid from outside of second barrier to inter barrier zone through breach . As fluid flows through breach in second barrier the fluid level in the portion of inter barrier zone proximate the breach rises from initial level to a level that is equal to level of fluid in the same fluid bearing zone in outer zone . An increase of fluid in fluid bearing zone may be detected by pumping monitor well positioned in the fluid bearing zone proximate breach .

Breach may be caused by ground shift. If second barrier is a low temperature zone formed by freeze wells the temperature of the formation at breach in the second barrier is below the freezing point of fluid entering from outer zone . Fluid from outer zone in breach may freeze and self repair second barrier .

First barrier and second barrier of the double barrier containment system may be formed by freeze wells. In an embodiment first barrier is formed first. The cooling load needed to maintain the first barrier is significantly less than the cooling load needed to form the first barrier. After formation of the first barrier the excess cooling capacity that the refrigeration system used to form the first barrier may be used to form a portion of the second barrier. In some embodiments the second barrier is formed first and the excess cooling capacity that the refrigeration system used to form the second barrier is used to form a portion of the first barrier. After the first and second barriers are formed excess cooling capacity supplied by the refrigeration system or refrigeration systems used to form the first barrier and the second barrier may be used to form a barrier or barriers around the next contained zone that is to be processed by the in situ conversion process.

Grout may be used in combination with freeze wells to provide a barrier for the in situ conversion process. The grout fills cavities vugs in the formation and reduces the permeability of the formation. Grout may have better thermal conductivity than gas and or formation fluid that fills cavities in the formation. Placing grout in the cavities may allow for faster low temperature zone formation. The grout forms a perpetual barrier in the formation that may strengthen the formation. The use of grout in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material may allow for larger well spacing than is possible without the use of grout. The combination of grout and the low temperature zone formed by freeze wells may constitute a double barrier for environmental regulation purposes.

Grout may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. The grout may be allowed to set. The integrity of the grout wall may be checked. The integrity of the grout wall may be checked by logging techniques and or by hydrostatic testing. If the permeability of a grouted section is too high additional grout may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. After the permeability of the grouted section is sufficiently reduced freeze wells may be installed in the freeze well wellbores.

Grout may be injected into the formation at a pressure that is high but below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments grouting is performed in 16 m increments in the freeze wellbore. Larger or smaller increments may be used if desired. In some embodiments grout is only applied to certain portions of the formation. For example grout may be applied to the formation through the freeze wellbore only adjacent to aquifer zones and or to relatively high permeability zones for example zones with a permeability greater than about 0.1 darcy . Applying grout to aquifers may inhibit migration of water from one aquifer to a different aquifer when an established low temperature zone thaws.

Grout used in the formation may be any type of grout including but not limited to fine cement micro fine cement sulfur sulfur cement viscous thermoplastics or combinations thereof. Fine cement may be ASTM type 3 Portland cement. Fine cement may be less expensive than micro fine cement. In an embodiment a freeze wellbore is formed in the formation. Selected portions of the freeze wellbore are grouted using fine cement. Then micro fine cement is injected into the formation through the freeze wellbore. The fine cement may reduce the permeability down to about 10 millidarcy. The micro fine cement may further reduce the permeability to about 0.1 millidarcy. After the grout is introduced into the formation a freeze wellbore canister may be inserted into the formation. The process may be repeated for each freeze well that will be used to form the barrier.

In some embodiments fine cement is introduced into every other freeze wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the remaining wellbores. For example grout may be used in a formation with freeze wellbores set at about 5 m spacing. A first wellbore is drilled and fine cement is introduced into the formation through the wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the first wellbore. A second wellbore is drilled 10 m away from the first wellbore. Fine cement is introduced into the formation through the second wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the second wellbore. A third wellbore is drilled between the first wellbore and the second wellbore. In some embodiments grout from the first and or second wellbores may be detected in the cuttings of the third wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the formation through the third wellbore. A freeze wellbore canister is positioned in the third wellbore. The same procedure is used to form the remaining freeze wells that will form the barrier around the treatment area.

In some embodiments in situ vitrification is used to form the barrier of the treatment area. During in situ vitrification formation is melted. The melted formation is allowed to slowly solidify to form the barrier. In situ vitrification is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 114 277 to Murphy et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. In some embodiments in situ vitrification is used to form the barrier before the in situ conversion process produces hydrocarbons from the treatment area. In some embodiments in situ vitrification is used after in situ conversion to isolate the treated area. In some embodiments in situ vitrification is used to strengthen or seal one or more portions of a perimeter barrier during the in situ conversion process. In situ vitrification may be used to seal off selected portions of the treatment area such as aquifer zones that would allow water entry into the treatment area.

In some embodiments in situ vitrification is used in combination with freeze wells to form a double barrier containment system for treating the formation. Wellbores for the freeze wells may be formed in the formation. An electrically conductive fluid may be injected into the wellbores and used with the in situ vitrification process to form a barrier in the formation. The relatively close spacing of the freeze wells may facilitate formation of an interconnected perimeter barrier by the in situ vitrification process. After in situ vitrification freeze wells may be installed in the wellbores. The freeze wells may be activated to form the low temperature zone. Formation fluid entering the low temperature zone freezes to form the frozen barrier. The frozen barrier and the solidified wall formed by the in situ vitrification process form the double barrier containment system.

In an embodiment freeze wells are installed and activated to form the frozen barrier that isolates the treatment area. Heater wells and production wells are formed in the treatment area. The heater wells are activated and the production wells are used to remove hydrocarbons from the treatment area using the in situ conversion process. After the hydrocarbons are produced from the formation a desired row or rows of heater wells may be utilized for the in situ vitrification process to form a permanent barrier. The heaters in the desired row or rows of heater wells may be removed from the formation. The desired row or rows of wells may be the outermost row or rows of heaters wells. Monitor wells and or production wells may also be used in the in situ vitrification process if needed or desired. The in situ process prepares the formation for in situ vitrification by removing water heating the formation to a high temperature and increasing the permeability adjacent to the outermost row or rows of wells. The increased permeability allows an electrically conductive fluid injected into the formation to permeate throughout the portions of the formation to be subjected to in situ vitrification.

If selected portions adjacent to the wells are to be subjected to in situ vitrification packers or isolators may be inserted into the wells to define the portions to be treated so that the whole depth of the perimeter does not need to be treated. Formation adjacent to the desired row or rows of wells may be flushed with carbon dioxide nitrogen or other fluid to remove residual contaminants and oxygen from the formation. Graphite or molybdenum electrodes may be inserted into one or more of the wells to be used for in situ vitrification. An electrically conductive material such as a graphite solution or slurry may be injected into the wells to flow to adjacent wells to electrically couple electrodes in the wells to electrodes in the adjacent wells. Electrical current is applied to the electrodes and the electrically conductive material to raise the temperature of the formation adjacent to the electrodes and electrically conductive material to a temperature in a range from about 1250 C. to about 1600 C. Raising the temperature of the formation into this temperature range forms molten formation. The molten formation may be drawn into the pores and vugs of the formation. The molten formation slowly solidifies to form an impermeable barrier when the electrical current is terminated or the molten formation flows sufficiently far away from the electrodes electrically conductive material and the molten formation cools. Vapors produced during the in situ vitrification process may be removed from the formation through production wells in the treatment area. After formation of the impermeable barrier by the in situ vitrification process maintenance of the freeze wall may be ended.

In certain embodiments a barrier may be formed in the formation after an in situ conversion process or a solution mining process by introducing a fluid into the formation. The in situ conversion process may heat the treatment area and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. The solution mining process may remove material from the treatment area and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. In certain embodiments the treatment area has an increased permeability of at least 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments the treatment area has an increased permeability of at least 1 darcy of at least 10 darcy or of at least 100 darcy. The increased permeability allows the fluid to spread in the formation into fractures microfractures and or pore spaces in the formation. The fluid may include bitumen heavy oil sulfur polymer saturated saline solution and or a reactant or reactants that react to form a precipitate solid or a high viscosity fluid in the formation. In some embodiments bitumen heavy oil and or sulfur used to form the barrier are obtained from treatment facilities of the in situ conversion process.

The fluid may be introduced into the formation as a liquid vapor or mixed phase fluid. The fluid may be introduced into a portion of the formation that is at an elevated temperature. In some embodiments the fluid is introduced into the formation through wells located near a perimeter of the treatment area. The fluid may be directed away from the treatment area. The elevated temperature of the formation maintains or allows the fluid to have a low viscosity so that the fluid moves away from the wells. A portion of the fluid may spread outwards in the formation towards a cooler portion of the formation. In the cooler portion of the formation the viscosity of the fluid increases a portion of the fluid precipitates and or the fluid solidifies so that the fluid forms the barrier to flow of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area.

In some embodiments a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds all or a portion of the treatment area. As the fluid introduced into the formation approaches the low temperature barrier the temperature of the formation becomes colder. The colder temperature increases the viscosity of the fluid enhances precipitation and or solidifies the fluid to form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The fluid may remain in the formation as a highly viscous fluid or a solid after the low temperature barrier has dissipated.

In certain embodiments saturated saline solution is introduced into the formation. Particles in the saturated saline solution may precipitate out of solution when the solution reaches a colder temperature. The solidified particles may form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The solidified particles may be substantially insoluble in formation fluid.

In certain embodiments brine with a selected crystallogy is introduced into the formation as a reactant. A second reactant such a carbon dioxide may be introduced into the formation to react with the brine and form a mineral complex in the formation that is substantially insoluble to formation fluid. In an embodiment the brine solution includes a sodium and aluminum solution. The second reactant introduced in the formation is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide reacts with the brine solution to produce dawsonite. The minerals may solidify and form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation.

In some embodiments the barrier may be formed using sulfur. Sulfur may be introduced into the formation through wells located near the perimeter of the treatment area. At least a portion of the sulfur spreads outwards from the treatment area towards a cooler portion of the formation. The introduced sulfur spreads outward and solidifies in the formation to form a sulfur barrier. The solidified sulfur in the formation forms a barrier to formation fluid flow into or out of the treatment area.

A temperature monitoring system may be installed in wellbores of freeze wells and or in monitor wells adjacent to the freeze wells to monitor the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or the low temperature zone established by the freeze wells. The monitoring system may be used to monitor progress of low temperature zone formation. The monitoring system may be used to determine the location of high temperature areas potential breakthrough locations or breakthrough locations after the low temperature zone has formed. Periodic monitoring of the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or low temperature zone established by the freeze wells may allow additional cooling to be provided to potential trouble areas before breakthrough occurs. Additional cooling may be provided at or adjacent to breakthroughs and high temperature areas to ensure the integrity of the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Additional cooling may be provided by increasing refrigerant flow through selected freeze wells installing an additional freeze well or freeze wells and or by providing a cryogenic fluid such as liquid nitrogen to the high temperature areas. Providing additional cooling to potential problem areas before breakthrough occurs may be more time efficient and cost efficient than sealing a breach reheating a portion of the treatment area that has been cooled by influx of fluid and or remediating an area outside of the breached frozen barrier.

In some embodiments a traveling thermocouple may be used to monitor the temperature profile of selected freeze wells or monitor wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system includes thermocouples placed at discrete locations in the wellbores of the freeze wells in the freeze wells and or in the monitoring wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system comprises a fiber optic temperature monitoring system.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems are available from Sensornet London United Kingdom Sensa Houston Tex. U.S.A. Luna Energy Blacksburg Va. U.S.A. Lios Technology GMBH Cologne Germany Oxford Electronics Ltd. Hampshire United Kingdom and Sabeus Sensor Systems Calabasas Calif. U.S.A. . The fiber optic temperature monitoring system includes a data system and one or more fiber optic cables. The data system includes one or more lasers for sending light to the fiber optic cable and one or more computers software and peripherals for receiving analyzing and outputting data. The data system may be coupled to one or more fiber optic cables.

A single fiber optic cable may be several kilometers long. The fiber optic cable may be installed in many freeze wells and or monitor wells. In some embodiments two fiber optic cables may be installed in each freeze well and or monitor well. The two fiber optic cables may be coupled. Using two fiber optic cables per well allows for compensation due to optical losses that occur in the wells and allows for better accuracy of measured temperature profiles.

A fiber of a fiber optic cable may be placed in a polymer tube. The polymer tube may be filled with a heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may be a gel or liquid that does not freeze at or above the temperature of formation refrigerant used to cool the formation. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid in the polymer tube is the same as the formation refrigerant for example a fluid available from Dynalene Heat Transfer Fluids or aqua ammonia. In some embodiments the fiber is blown into the tube using the heat transfer fluid. Using the heat transfer fluid to insert the fiber into the polymer tube removes moisture from the polymer tube.

In some embodiments a protective sleeve is strapped to the canister of the freeze well as the canister is introduced into the formation. The protective sleeve may be in a u shape. A turn around sub near the end of the canister may accommodate the u turn in the protective sleeve. A fiber may be inserted in the protective sleeve. depicts a portion of canister with protective sleeve coupled to the canister by straps . Protective sleeve may be stainless steel tubing or other tubing.

The polymer tube and fiber may be placed in the protective sleeve such as inch stainless steel tubing to form the fiber optic cable. The protective sleeve may be prestressed to accommodate thermal contraction at low temperatures. The protective sleeve may be filled with the heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments the polymer tube is blown into the protective sleeve with the heat transfer fluid. Using the heat transfer fluid to insert the polymer tube and fiber into the protective sleeve removes moisture from the protective sleeve. In some embodiments two fibers are positioned in the same stainless steel tube. In some embodiments the fiber is placed directly in the protective sleeve without being placed in a polymer tube.

In some embodiments the fiber optic cable is strapped to the canister of the freeze well as the canister is inserted into the formation. The fiber optic cable may be coiled around the canister adjacent to the portions of the formation that are to be reduced to low temperature to form the low temperature zone. Coiling the fiber optic cable around the canister allows a large length of the fiber optic cable to be adjacent to areas that are to be reduced to low temperature. The large length allows for better resolution of the temperature profile for the areas to be reduced to low temperatures. In some embodiments the fiber optic cable is placed in the canister of the freeze well.

In some embodiments the data system is a double ended system. The data system may include one or more lasers that send light pulses into each end of the fiber optic cable. In some embodiments the laser is one laser. The laser sends pulses to each end of the fiber optic cable in an alternating manner. The return signals received by the data system allows for compensation of signal attenuation in the optical fiber.

In some embodiments computer control system is in communication with the fiber optic temperature monitoring system and the formation refrigeration circulation system. The formation refrigeration circulation system may include refrigeration system . Refrigeration system sends chilled formation refrigerant to wellheads of freeze wells through piping . In some embodiments the formation refrigerant passes down the inlet conduit of the freeze well and up through the annular space between the inlet conduit and the freeze well canister. The formation refrigerant then passes through piping to the next freeze well.

Computer control system may allow for automatic monitoring of the low temperature zone established by freeze wells . Computer control system may periodically shut down the flow of formation refrigerant to a set of freeze wells for a given time. For example computer control system may shut down the flow of formation refrigerant to a specific set of freeze wells every 60 days for a period of two days and activate data system to monitor the temperature profile near the shut down freeze wells. The temperature profile of the freeze wells with no formation refrigerant flow will begin to rise.

Computer control system may monitor the rate of increase of temperature. If there is a problem area the temperature profile near the problem area will show a greater rate of change than the temperature profile of adjacent areas. If a larger than expected temperature increase occurs at approximately the same depth location at or near two adjacent wells the computer control system may signal that there is a problem to an operator of the system. The location of the problem area may be estimated modeled assessed by comparing the temperature increases between adjacent wells. For example if the temperature increase in a first well is twice as large as the temperature increase in a second well then the location of the problem area is likely closer to the first well. Extra cooling and or extra monitoring can be provided to problem areas. Extra cooling may be provided by increasing the flow of formation refrigerant to the problem area and or by installing one or more additional freeze wells. If no problems are detected during the given time the computer system restarts the flow of formation fluid to the specific set of freeze wells and begins a test of another set of freeze wells. Using computer control system to monitor the low temperature zone established by freeze wells allows for problems to be detected and fixed before a breach of the barrier formed by the freeze wells occurs.

In some embodiments the fiber optic temperature monitoring system utilizes Brillouin or Raman scattering systems. Such systems provide spatial resolution of 1 m and temperature resolution of 0.1 C. With sufficient averaging and temperature calibration the systems may be accurate to 0.5 C.

In some embodiments the fiber optic temperature monitoring system may be a Bragg system that uses a fiber optic cable etched with closely spaced Bragg gratings. The Bragg gratings may be formed in 1 foot increments along selected lengths of the fiber. Fibers with Bragg gratings are available from Luna Energy. The Bragg system only requires a single fiber optic cable to be placed in each well that is to be monitored. The Bragg system is able to measure the fiber temperature in a few seconds.

The fiber optic temperature monitoring system may be used to detect the location of a breach or a potential breach in a frozen barrier. The search for potential breaches may be performed at scheduled intervals for example every two or three months. To determine the location of the breach or potential breach flow of formation refrigerant to the freeze wells of interest is stopped. In some embodiments the flow of formation refrigerant to all of the freeze wells is stopped. The rise in the temperature profiles as well as the rate of change of the temperature profiles provided by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for each freeze well can be used to determine the location of any breaches or hot spots in the low temperature zone maintained by the freeze wells. The temperature profile monitored by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for the two freeze wells closest to the hot spot or fluid flow will show the quickest and greatest rise in temperature. A temperature change of a few degrees Centigrade in the temperature profiles of the freeze wells closest to a troubled area may be sufficient to isolate the location of the trouble area. The shut down time of flow of circulation fluid in the freeze wells of interest needed to detect breaches potential breaches and hot spots may be on the order of a few hours or days depending on the well spacing and the amount of fluid flow affecting the low temperature zone.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems may also be used to monitor temperatures in heated portions of the formation during in situ conversion processes. The fiber of a fiber optic cable used in the heated portion of the formation may be clad with a reflective material to facilitate retention of a signal or signals transmitted down the fiber. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with gold copper nickel aluminum and or alloys thereof. The cladding may be formed of a material that is able to withstand chemical and temperature conditions in the heated portion of the formation. For example gold cladding may allow an optical sensor to be used up to temperatures of 700 C. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with aluminum. The fiber may be dipped in or run through a bath of liquid aluminum. The clad fiber may then be allowed to cool to secure the aluminum to the fiber. The gold or aluminum cladding may reduce hydrogen darkening of the optical fiber.

In some embodiments heaters that heat hydrocarbons in the formation may be close to the low temperature zone established by freeze wells. In some embodiments heaters may be may be 20 m 10 m 5 m or less from an edge of the low temperature zone established by freeze wells. In some embodiments heat interceptor wells may be positioned between the low temperature zone and the heaters to reduce the heat load applied to the low temperature zone from the heated part of the formation. depicts a schematic view of the well layout plan for heater wells production wells heat interceptor wells and freeze wells for a portion of an in situ conversion system embodiment. Heat interceptor wells are positioned between heater wells and freeze wells .

Some heat interceptor wells may be formed in the formation specifically for the purpose of reducing the heat load applied to the low temperature zone established by freeze wells. Some heat interceptor wells may be heater wellbores monitor wellbores production wellbores dewatering wellbores or other type of wellbores that are converted for use as heat interceptor wells.

In some embodiments heat interceptor wells may function as heat pipes to reduce the heat load applied to the low temperature zone. A liquid heat transfer fluid may be placed in the heat interceptor wellbores. The liquid may include but is not limited to water alcohol and or alkanes. Heat supplied to the formation from the heaters may advance to the heat interceptor wellbores and vaporize the liquid heat transfer fluid in the heat interceptor wellbores. The resulting vapor may rise in the wellbores. Above the heated portion of the formation adjacent to the overburden the vapor may condense and flow by gravity back to the area adjacent to the heated part of the formation. The heat absorbed by changing the phase of the liquid heat transfer fluid reduces the heat load applied to the low temperature zone. Using heat interceptor wells that function as heat pipes may be advantageous for formations with thick overburdens that are able to absorb the heat applied as the heat transfer fluid changes phase from vapor to liquid. The wellbore may include wicking material packing to increase surface area adjacent to a portion of the overburden or other material to promote heat transfer to or from the formation and the heat transfer fluid.

In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid is circulated through the heat interceptor wellbores in a closed loop system. A heat exchanger reduces the temperature of the heat transfer fluid after the heat transfer fluid leaves the heat interceptor wellbores. Cooled heat transfer fluid is pumped through the heat interceptor wellbores. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid does not undergo a phase change during use. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid may change phases during use. The heat transfer fluid may be but is not limited to water alcohol and or glycol.

A potential source of heat loss from the heated formation is due to reflux in wells. Refluxing occurs when vapors condense in a well and flow into a portion of the well adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. Vapors may condense in the well adjacent to the overburden of the formation to form condensed fluid. Condensed fluid flowing into the well adjacent to the heated formation absorbs heat from the formation. Heat absorbed by condensed fluids cools the formation and necessitates additional energy input into the formation to maintain the formation at a desired temperature. Some fluids that condense in the overburden and flow into the portion of the well adjacent to the heated formation may react to produce undesired compounds and or coke. Inhibiting fluids from refluxing may significantly improve the thermal efficiency of the in situ conversion system and or the quality of the product produced from the in situ conversion system.

For some well embodiments the portion of the well adjacent to the overburden section of the formation is cemented to the formation. In some well embodiments the well includes packing material placed near the transition from the heated section of the formation to the overburden. The packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing from the heated section of the formation into the section of the wellbore adjacent to the overburden. Cables conduits devices and or instruments may pass through the packing material but the packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing up the wellbore adjacent to the overburden section of the formation.

In some embodiments a gas may be introduced into the formation through wellbores to inhibit reflux in the wellbores. In some embodiments gas may be introduced into wellbores that include baffle systems to inhibit reflux of fluid in the wellbores. The gas may be carbon dioxide methane nitrogen or other desired gas.

In some well embodiments a ball type reflux baffle system may be used in heater wells to inhibit reflux. depicts an embodiment of ball type reflux baffle system positioned in a cased portion of a heater well. Ball type reflux baffle may include insert and balls . A portion of heater element passes through insert . The portion of heater element that passes through insert is a portion of the heater element that does not heat to a high temperature. Insert may be made of metal plastic and or steel able to withstand temperatures of over 160 C. In an embodiment insert is made of phenolic resin.

Insert may be guided down the casing of the wellbore using a coil tubing guide string. Insert may be set in position using slips that fit in one or more indentions in the insert using protrusions of the insert that fit in one or more recesses in the casing or the insert may rest on a shoulder of the casing. After removal of the coil tubing guide string balls may be dropped down the casing onto insert . Balls may be made of any desired material able to withstand temperatures of over 160 C. In some embodiments balls are made of silicon nitride. Balls of varying diameters may be used. Balls inhibit fluid convection.

During the in situ conversion process heater element may need to be pulled from the well. When heater element is removed from the well balls may pass through insert to the bottom of the well. Another heater element may be installed in the well and additional balls may be dropped down the well to land on insert .

In some embodiments one or more circular baffles may be coupled to a portion of a heating element to inhibit convection of fluid. The baffles may substantially fill the annular space between the heating element and the casing. The baffles may be made of an electrically insulative material such as a ceramic or plastic. In some embodiments the baffles may be made of fiberglass or silicon nitride. The baffles may position the heating element in the center of the casing.

The ball type baffle system and or the circular baffle system may work better if a gas purge is introduced into the wellbore. The gas purge may maintain sufficient pressure in the wellbore to inhibit fluid flow from the heated portion of the formation into the wellbore. The gas purge may enhance heat exchange at the baffle system to help maintain a top portion of the baffle system colder than the lower portion of the baffle system.

The flow of production fluid up the well to the surface is desired for some types of wells especially for production wells. Flow of production fluid up the well is also desirable for some heater wells that are used to control pressure in the formation. The overburden or a conduit in the well used to transport formation fluid from the heated portion of the formation to the surface may be heated to inhibit condensation on or in the conduit. Providing heat in the overburden however may be costly and or may lead to increased cracking or coking of formation fluid as the formation fluid is being produced from the formation.

To avoid the need to heat the overburden or to heat the conduit passing through the overburden one or more diverters may be placed in the wellbore to inhibit fluid from refluxing into the wellbore adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments the diverter retains fluid above the heated portion of the formation. Fluids retained in the diverter may be removed from the diverter using a pump gas lifting and or other fluid removal technique. In some embodiments the diverter directs fluid to a pump gas lift assembly or other fluid removal device located below the heated portion of the formation.

In some embodiments production well includes heater . Heater provides heat to vaporize liquids in a portion of production well proximate hydrocarbon layer . Heater may be located in production conduit or may be coupled to the outside of the production conduit. In embodiments where the heater is located outside of the production conduit a portion of the heater passes through the packing material.

In some embodiments a diluent may be introduced into production conduit and or conduit . The diluent is used to inhibit clogging in production conduit pump and or conduit . The diluent may be but is not limited to being water an alcohol a solvent and or a surfactant.

In some embodiments riser extends to the surface of production well . Perforations and a baffle in riser located above seal direct condensed liquid from the riser into production conduit .

In certain embodiments two or more diverters may be located in the production well. Two or more diverters provide a simple way of separating initial fractions of condensed fluid produced from the in situ conversion system. A pump may be placed in each of the diverters to remove condensed fluid from the diverters.

In some embodiments fluids gases and liquids may be directed towards the bottom of the production well using the diverter. The fluids may be produced from the bottom of the production well. depicts an embodiment of the diverter that directs fluid towards the bottom of the production well. Diverter may include packing material and baffle positioned in production conduit . Baffle may be a pipe positioned around conduit . Production conduit may have openings that allow fluids to enter the production conduit from hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments all or a portion of the openings are adjacent to a non hydrocarbon layer of the formation through which heated formation fluid flows. Openings include but are not limited to screens perforations slits and or slots. Hydrocarbon layer may be heated using heaters located in other portions of the formation and or a heater located in production conduit .

Baffle and packing material direct formation fluid entering production conduit to unheated zone . Unheated zone is in the underburden of the formation. A portion of the formation fluid may condense on the outer surface of baffle or on walls of production conduit adjacent to unheated zone . Liquid fluid from the formation and or condensed fluid may flow by gravity to a sump or bottom portion of production conduit . Liquid and condensate in the bottom portion of production conduit may be pumped to the surface through conduit using pump . Pump may be placed 1 m 5 m 10 m 20 m or more into the underburden. In some embodiments the pump may be placed in a non cased open portion of the wellbore. Non condensed fluid initially travels through the annular space between baffle and conduit and then through the annular space between production conduit and conduit to the surface as indicated by arrows in . If a portion of the non condensed fluid condenses adjacent to overburden while traveling to the surface the condensed fluid will flow by gravity toward the bottom portion of production conduit to the intake for pump . Heat absorbed by the condensed fluid as the fluid passes through the heated portion of the formation is from contact with baffle not from direct contact with the formation. Baffle is heated by formation fluid and radiative heat transfer from the formation. Significantly less heat from the formation is transferred to the condensed fluid as the fluid flows through baffle adjacent to the heated portion than if the condensed fluid was able to contact the formation. The condensed fluid flowing down the baffle may absorb enough heat from the vapor in the wellbore to condense a portion of the vapor on the outer surface of baffle . The condensed portion of the vapor may flow down the baffle to the bottom portion of the wellbore.

In some embodiments diluent may be introduced into production conduit and or conduit . The diluent is used to inhibit clogging in production conduit pump and conduit . The diluent may include but is not limited to water an alcohol a solvent a surfactant or combinations thereof. Different diluents may be introduced at different times. For example a solvent may be introduced when production first begins to put into solution high molecular weight hydrocarbons that are initially produced from the formation. At a later time water may be substituted for the solvent.

In some embodiments a separate conduit may introduce the diluent to the wellbore near the underburden as depicted in . Production conduit directs vapor produced from the formation to the surface through overburden . If a portion of the vapor condenses in production conduit the condensate can flow down baffle to the intake for pump . Diverter comprising packing material and baffle directs formation fluid flow from heated hydrocarbon layer to unheated zone . Liquid formation fluid is transported by pump through conduit to the surface. Vapor formation fluid is transported through baffle to production conduit . Conduit may be strapped to baffle . Conduit may introduce the diluent to wellbore adjacent to unheated zone . The diluent may promote condensation of formation fluid and or inhibit clogging of pump . Diluent in conduit may be at a high pressure. If the diluent changes phase from liquid to vapor while passing through the heated portion of the formation the change in pressure as the diluent leaves conduit allows the diluent to condense.

In some embodiments the intake of the pump system is located in casing in the sump. In some embodiments the intake of the pump system is located in an open wellbore. The sump is below the heated portion of the formation. The intake of the pump may be located 1 m 5 m 10 m 20 m or more below the deepest heater used to heat the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be at a cooler temperature than the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be more than 10 C. more than 50 C. more than 75 C. or more than 100 C. below the temperature of the heated portion of the formation. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may be liquid. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may condense within the sump.

Production well lift systems may be used to efficiently transport formation fluid from the bottom of the production wells to the surface. Production well lift systems may provide and maintain the maximum required well drawdown minimum reservoir producing pressure and producing rates. The production well lift systems may operate efficiently over a wide range of high temperature multiphase fluids gas vapor steam water hydrocarbon liquids and production rates expected during the life of a typical project.

The diameter of outer conduit may be chosen to allow a desired range of flow rates and or to minimize the pressure drop and flowing reservoir pressure. Reflux seal at the base of outer conduit may inhibit hot produced gases and or vapors from contacting the relatively cold wall of well casing above heated portion . This minimizes potentially damaging and wasteful energy losses from heated portion via condensation and recycling of fluids. Reflux seal may be a dynamic seal allowing outer conduit to thermally expand and contract while being fixed at surface . Reflux seal may be a one way seal designed to allow fluids to be pumped down annulus for treatment or for well kill operations. For example down facing elastomeric type cups may be used in reflux seal to inhibit fluids from flowing upward through annulus . In some embodiments reflux seal is a fixed design with a dynamic wellhead seal that allows outer conduit to move at surface thereby reducing thermal stresses and cycling.

Conditions in any particular well or project could allow both ends of outer conduit to be fixed. Outer conduit may require no or infrequent retrieval for maintenance over the expected useful life of the production well. In some embodiments utility bundle is coupled to the outside of outer conduit . Utility bundle may include but is not limited to conduits for monitoring control and or treatment equipment such as temperature pressure monitoring devices chemical treatment lines diluent injection lines and cold fluid injection lines for cooling of the liquid pumping system. Coupling utility bundle to outer conduit may allow the utility bundle and thus the potentially complex and sensitive equipment included in this bundle to remain in place during retrieval and or maintenance of inner conduit . In certain embodiments outer conduit is removed one or more times over the expected useful life of the production well.

Annulus between well casing and outer conduit may provide a space to run utility bundle and instrumentation as well as thermal insulation to optimize and or control temperature and or behavior of the produced fluid. In some embodiments annulus is filled with one or more fluids or gases pressurized or not to allow regulation of the overall thermal conductivity and resulting heat transfer between the overburden and the formation fluid being produced. Using annulus as a thermal barrier may allow 1 optimization of temperature and or phase behavior of the fluid stream for subsequent processing of the fluid stream at the surface and or 2 optimization of multiphase behavior to enable maximum natural flow of fluids and liquid stream pumping. The concentric configuration of outer conduit and inner conduit is advantageous in that the heat transfer thermal effects on the fluid streams are more uniform than a conventional dual parallel tubing configuration.

Inner conduit may be used for production of liquids. Liquids produced from inner conduit may include fluids in liquid form that are not entrained with gas vapor produced from outer conduit as well as liquids that condense in the outer conduit. In some embodiments the base of inner conduit is positioned below the base of heated portion in sump to assist in natural gravity separation of the liquid phase. Sump may be a separation sump. Sump may also provide thermal benefits for example cooler pump operation and reduced liquid flashing in the pump depending upon the length depth of the sump and overall fluid rates and or temperatures.

Inner conduit may include a pump system. In some embodiments pump system is an oilfield type reciprocating rod pump. Such pumps are available in a wide variety of designs and configurations. Reciprocating rod pumps have the advantages of being widely available and cost effective. In addition surveillance evaluation analysis methods are well developed and understood for this system. In certain embodiments the prime mover is advantageously located on the surface for accessibility and maintenance. Location of the prime mover on the surface also protects the prime mover from the extreme temperature fluid environment of the wellbore. depicts a conventional oilfield type beam pumping unit on surface for reciprocation of rod string . Other types of pumping units may be used including but not limited to hydraulic units long stroke units air balance units surface driven rotary units and MII units. A variety of surface unit pump combinations may be employed depending on well conditions and desired pumping rates. In certain embodiments inner conduit is anchored to limit movement and wear of the inner conduit.

Concentric placement of outer conduit and inner conduit may facilitate maintenance of the inner conduit and the associated pump system including intervention and or replacement of downhole components. The concentric design allows for maintenance removal replacement of inner conduit without disturbing outer conduit and related components thus lowering overall expenses reducing well downtime and or improving overall project performance compared to a conventional parallel double conduit configuration. The concentric configuration may also be modified to account for unexpected changes in well conditions over time. The pump system can be quickly removed and both conduits may be utilized for flowing production in the event of lower liquid rates or much higher vapor gas rates than anticipated. Conversely a larger or different system can easily be installed in the inner conduit without affecting the balance of the system components.

Various methods may be used to control the pump system to enhance efficiency and well production. These methods may include for example the use of on off timers pump off detection systems to measure surface loads and model the downhole conditions direct fluid level sensing devices and sensors suitable for high temperature applications capillary tubing etc. to allow direct downhole pressure monitoring. In some embodiments the pumping capacity is matched with available fluid to be pumped from the well.

Various design options and or configurations for the conduits and or rod string including materials physical dimensions and connections may be chosen to enhance overall reliability cost ease of initial installation and subsequent intervention and or maintenance for a given production well. For example connections may be threaded welded or designed for a specific application. In some embodiments sections of one or more of the conduits are connected as the conduit is lowered into the well. In certain embodiments sections of one or more of the conduits are connected prior to insertion in the well and the conduit is spooled for example at a different location and later unspooled into the well. The specific conditions within each production well determine equipment parameters such as equipment sizing conduit diameters and sump dimensions for optimal operation and performance.

Fluids of all phases may enter the well from heated portion . These fluids are directed downward to sump . The fluids enter lift chamber through check valve at the base of the lift chamber. After sufficient fluid has entered lift chamber lift gas injection valve opens and allows pressurized lift gas to enter the top of the lift chamber. Crossover port allows the lift gas to pass through packer reflux seal assembly into the top of lift chamber . The resulting pressure increase in lift chamber closes check valve at the base and forces the fluids into the bottom of diptube up into conduit and out of the lift chamber. Lift gas injection valve remains open until sufficient lift gas has been injected to evacuate the fluid in lift chamber to a collection device. Lift gas injection valve then closes and allows lift chamber to fill with fluid again. This lift cycle repeats intermittent operation as often as necessary to maintain the desired drawdown pressure within heated portion . Sizing of equipment such as conduits valves and chamber lengths and or diameters is dependent upon the expected fluid rates produced from heated portion and the desired minimum drawdown pressure to be maintained in the production well.

In some embodiments the entire chamber lift system may be retrievable from the well for repair maintenance and periodic design revisions due to changing well conditions. However the need for retrieving conduit packer reflux seal assembly and lift chamber may be relatively infrequent. In some embodiments lift gas injection valve is configured to be retrieved from the well along with conduit . In certain embodiments lift gas injection valve is configured to be separately retrievable via wireline or similar means without removing conduit or other system components from the well. Check valve and or diptube may be individually installed and or retrieved in a similar manner. The option to retrieve diptube separately may allow re sizing of gas vapor vent . The option to retrieve these individual components items that would likely require the most frequent well intervention repair and maintenance greatly improves the attractiveness of the system from a well intervention and maintenance cost perspective.

Gas vapor vent may be located at the top of diptube to allow gas and or vapor entering the lift chamber from heated portion to continuously vent into conduit and inhibit an excess buildup of chamber pressure. Inhibiting an excess buildup of chamber pressure may increase overall system efficiency. Gas vapor vent may be sized to avoid excessive bypassing of injected lift gas into conduit during the lift cycle thereby promoting flow of the injected lift gas around the base of diptube .

The embodiment depicted in includes a single lift gas injection valve rather than multiple intermediate unloading valves typically used in gas lift applications . Having a single lift gas injection valve greatly simplifies the downhole system design and or mechanics thereby reducing the complexity and cost and increasing the reliability of the overall system. Having a single lift gas injection valve however does require that the available gas lift system pressure be sufficient to overcome and displace the heaviest fluid that might fill the entire wellbore or some other means to initially unload the well in that event. Unloading valves may be used in some embodiments where the production wells are deep in the formation for example greater than 900 m deep greater than 1000 m deep or greater than 1500 m deep in the formation.

In some embodiments the chamber well casing internal diameter ratio is kept as high as possible to maximize volumetric efficiency of the system. Keeping the chamber well casing internal diameter ratio as high as possible may allow overall drawdown pressure and fluid production into the well to be maximized while pressure imposed on the heated portion is minimized.

Lift gas injection valve and the gas delivery and control system may be designed to allow large volumes of gas to be injected into lift chamber in a relatively short period of time to maximize the efficiency and minimize the time period for fluid evacuation. This may allow liquid fallback in conduit to be decreased or minimized while overall well fluid production potential is increased or maximized .

Various methods may be used to allow control of lift gas injection valve and the amount of gas injected during each lift cycle. Lift gas injection valve may be designed to be self controlled sensitive to either lift chamber pressure or casing pressure. That is lift gas injection valve may be similar to tubing pressure operated or casing pressure operated valves routinely used in conventional oilfield gas lift applications. Alternatively lift gas injection valve may be controlled from the surface via either electric or hydraulic signal. These methods may be supplemented by additional controls that regulate the rate and or pressure at which lift gas is injected into annulus at surface . Other design and or installation options for chamber lift systems for example types of conduit connections and or method of installation may be chosen from a range of approaches known in the art.

As depicted in the downhole lift gas injection valve has been eliminated and injection gas control valve is located above surface . In some embodiments the downhole valve is used in addition to or in lieu of injection gas control valve . Using the downhole control valve along with injection gas control valve may allow the injection gas tubing pressure to be retained in the displacement cycle mode.

As depicted in diptube may be an integral part of conduit and lift chamber . With diptube an integral part of conduit and lift chamber check valve at the bottom of the lift chamber may be more easily accessed for example via non rig intervention methods including but not limited to wireline and coil tubing and a larger diptube diameter may be used for higher liquid fluid volumes. The retrievable diptube arrangement as previously described may be applied here as well depending upon specific well requirements.

Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self limit temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the material to provide a reduced amount of heat at or near the Curie temperature when a time varying current is applied to the material. In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic material self limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments the selected temperature is within about 35 C. within about 25 C. within about 20 C. or within about 10 C. of the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials for example highly conductive materials high strength materials corrosion resistant materials or combinations thereof to provide various electrical and or mechanical properties. Some parts of the temperature limited heater may have a lower resistance caused by different geometries and or by using different ferromagnetic and or non ferromagnetic materials than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.

Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are able to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds or is about to exceed a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties for example electrical resistance of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.

In certain embodiments the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced second heat output heat output near at or above the Curie temperature of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time varying current. The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self limit. In some embodiments the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature 50 C. 75 C. 100 C. or 125 C. below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.

The temperature limited heater may be energized by time varying current alternating current or modulated direct current supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components for example modulation components transformers and or capacitors used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials the skin effect is dominated by the magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 for example the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50 100 500 1000 or greater . As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature and or as the applied electrical current is increased the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly for example the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability . The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near at or above the Curie temperature and or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source portions of the heater that approach reach or are above the Curie temperature may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows the heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.

Curie temperature heaters have been used in soldering equipment heaters for medical applications and heating elements for ovens for example pizza ovens . Some of these uses are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 579 575 to Lamome et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 065 501 to Henschen et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 512 732 to Yagnik et al. all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. U.S. Pat. No. 4 849 611 to Whitney et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes a plurality of discrete spaced apart heating units including a reactive component a resistive heating component and a temperature responsive component.

An advantage of using the temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater and other equipment below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion creep and or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibits overheating or burnout of the heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and or withstand heat at temperatures above 25 C. 37 C. 100 C. 250 C. 500 C. 700 C. 800 C. 900 C. or higher up to 1131 C. depending on the materials used in the heater.

The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and burn out. The heat output adjacent to the low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater but the remaining portions of the temperature limited heater that are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output. Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths for example at least 10 m at least 100 m at least 300 m at least 500 m at least 1 km or more up to about 10 km the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater.

The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis typically requires 9.5 years to 10 years of heating when using a 12 m heater well spacing with conventional constant wattage heaters. For the same heater spacing temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis may occur in 5 years using temperature limited heaters with a 12 m heater well spacing. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underburden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.

Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids mobilizing fluids and or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in the formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.

The use of temperature limited heaters in some embodiments eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to perform temperature logging and or the need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.

In certain embodiments phase transformation for example crystalline phase transformation or a change in the crystal structure of materials used in a temperature limited heater change the selected temperature at which the heater self limits. Ferromagnetic material used in the temperature limited heater may have a phase transformation for example a transformation from ferrite to austenite that decreases the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material. This reduction in magnetic permeability is similar to reduction in magnetic permeability due to the magnetic transition of the ferromagnetic material at the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is the magnetic transition temperature of the ferrite phase of the ferromagnetic material. The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the temperature limited heater near at or above the temperature of the phase transformation and or the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

The phase transformation of the ferromagnetic material may occur over a temperature range. The temperature range of the phase transformation depends on the ferromagnetic material and may vary for example over a range of about 20 C. to a range of about 200 C. Because the phase transformation takes place over a temperature range the reduction in the magnetic permeability due to the phase transformation takes place over the temperature range. The reduction in magnetic permeability may also occur irregularly over the temperature range of the phase transformation. In some embodiments the phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase of the ferromagnetic material is slower than the phase transformation to the higher temperature phase for example the transition from austenite back to ferrite is slower than the transition from ferrite to austenite . The slower phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase may cause irregular operation of the heater at or near the phase transformation temperature range.

In some embodiments the phase transformation temperature range overlaps with the reduction in the magnetic permeability when the temperature approaches the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. The overlap may produce a slower drop in electrical resistance versus temperature than if the reduction in magnetic permeability is solely due to the temperature approaching the Curie temperature. The overlap may also produce irregular behavior of the temperature limited heater near the Curie temperature and or in the phase transformation temperature range.

In certain embodiments alloy additions are made to the ferromagnetic material to adjust the temperature range of the phase transformation. For example adding carbon to the ferromagnetic material may increase the phase transformation temperature range and lower the onset temperature of the phase transformation. Adding titanium to the ferromagnetic material may increase the onset temperature of the phase transformation and decrease the phase transformation temperature range. Alloy compositions may be adjusted to provide desired Curie temperature and phase transformation properties for the ferromagnetic material. The alloy composition of the ferromagnetic material may be chosen based on desired properties for the ferromagnetic material such as but not limited to magnetic permeability transition temperature or temperature range resistance versus temperature profile or power output . Addition of titanium may allow higher Curie temperatures to be obtained when adding cobalt to 410 stainless steel by raising the ferrite to austenite phase transformation temperature range to a temperature range that is above or well above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater is deformation tolerant. Localized movement of material in the wellbore may result in lateral stresses on the heater that could deform its shape. Locations along a length of the heater at which the wellbore approaches or closes on the heater may be hot spots where a standard heater overheats and has the potential to burn out. These hot spots may lower the yield strength and creep strength of the metal allowing crushing or deformation of the heater. The temperature limited heater may be formed with S curves or other non linear shapes that accommodate deformation of the temperature limited heater without causing failure of the heater.

In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are more economical to manufacture or make than standard heaters. Typical ferromagnetic materials include iron carbon steel or ferritic stainless steel. Such materials are inexpensive as compared to nickel based heating alloys such as nichrome Kanthal Bulten Kanthal AB Sweden and or LOHM Driver Harris Company Harrison N.J. U.S.A. typically used in insulated conductor mineral insulated cable heaters. In one embodiment of the temperature limited heater the temperature limited heater is manufactured in continuous lengths as an insulated conductor heater to lower costs and improve reliability.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is placed in the heater well using a coiled tubing rig. A heater that can be coiled on a spool may be manufactured by using metal such as ferritic stainless steel for example 409 stainless steel that is welded using electrical resistance welding ERW . To form a heater section a metal strip from a roll is passed through a first former where it is shaped into a tubular and then longitudinally welded using ERW. The tubular is passed through a second former where a conductive strip for example a copper strip is applied drawn down tightly on the tubular through a die and longitudinally welded using ERW. A sheath may be formed by longitudinally welding a support material for example steel such as 347H or 347HH over the conductive strip material. The support material may be a strip rolled over the conductive strip material. An overburden section of the heater may be formed in a similar manner.

In certain embodiments the overburden section uses a non ferromagnetic material such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel instead of a ferromagnetic material. The heater section and overburden section may be coupled using standard techniques such as butt welding using an orbital welder. In some embodiments the overburden section material the non ferromagnetic material may be pre welded to the ferromagnetic material before rolling. The pre welding may eliminate the need for a separate coupling step for example butt welding . In an embodiment a flexible cable for example a furnace cable such as a MGT 1000 furnace cable may be pulled through the center after forming the tubular heater. An end bushing on the flexible cable may be welded to the tubular heater to provide an electrical current return path. The tubular heater including the flexible cable may be coiled onto a spool before installation into a heater well. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater is installed using the coiled tubing rig. The coiled tubing rig may place the temperature limited heater in a deformation resistant container in the formation. The deformation resistant container may be placed in the heater well using conventional methods.

In an embodiment a Curie heater includes a furnace cable inside a ferromagnetic conduit for example a Schedule 80 446 stainless steel pipe . The ferromagnetic conduit may be clad with copper or another suitable conductive material. The ferromagnetic conduit may be placed in a deformation tolerant conduit or deformation resistant container. The deformation tolerant conduit may tolerate longitudinal deformation radial deformation and creep. The deformation tolerant conduit may also support the ferromagnetic conduit and furnace cable. The deformation tolerant conduit may be selected based on creep and or corrosion resistance near or at the Curie temperature. In one embodiment the deformation tolerant conduit is 1 Schedule 80 347H stainless steel pipe outside diameter of about 4.826 cm or 1 Schedule 160 347H stainless steel pipe outside diameter of about 4.826 cm .

The diameter and or materials of the deformation tolerant conduit may vary depending on for example characteristics of the formation to be heated or desired heat output characteristics of the heater. In certain embodiments air is removed from the annulus between the deformation tolerant conduit and the clad ferromagnetic conduit. The space between the deformation tolerant conduit and the clad ferromagnetic conduit may be flushed with a pressurized inert gas for example helium nitrogen argon or mixtures thereof . In some embodiments the inert gas may include a small amount of hydrogen to act as a getter for residual oxygen. The inert gas may pass down the annulus from the surface enter the inner diameter of the ferromagnetic conduit through a small hole near the bottom of the heater and flow up inside the ferromagnetic conduit. Removal of the air in the annulus may reduce oxidation of materials in the heater for example the nickel coated copper wires of the furnace cable to provide a longer life heater especially at elevated temperatures. Thermal conduction between the furnace cable and the ferromagnetic conduit and between the ferromagnetic conduit and the deformation tolerant conduit may be improved when the inert gas is helium. The pressurized inert gas in the annular space may also provide additional support for the deformation tolerant conduit against high formation pressures. Pressurized inert gas also inhibits arcing between metal conductors in the annular space compared to inert gas at atmospheric pressure.

In certain embodiments a thermally conductive fluid such as helium may be placed inside void volumes of the temperature limited heater where heat is transferred. Placing thermally conductive fluid inside void volumes of the temperature limited heater may improve thermal conduction inside the void volumes. Thermally conductive fluids include but are not limited to gases that are thermally conductive electrically insulating and radiantly transparent. In certain embodiments thermally conductive fluid in the void volumes has a higher thermal conductivity than air at standard temperature and pressure STP 0 C. and 101.325 kPa . Radiantly transparent gases include gases with diatomic or single atoms that do not absorb a significant amount of infrared energy. In certain embodiments thermally conductive fluids include helium and or hydrogen. Thermally conductive fluids may also be thermally stable at operating temperatures in the temperature limited heater so that the thermally conductive fluids do not thermally crack at operating temperature in the temperature limited heater.

Thermally conductive fluid may be placed inside a conductor inside a conduit and or inside a jacket of a temperature limited heater. The thermally conductive fluid may be placed in the space the annulus between one or more components for example conductor conduit or jacket of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments thermally conductive fluid is placed in the space the annulus between the temperature limited heater and a conduit.

In certain embodiments air and or other fluid in the space the annulus is displaced by a flow of thermally conductive fluid during introduction of the thermally conductive fluid into the space. In some embodiments air and or other fluid is removed for example vacuumed flushed or pumped out from the space before introducing thermally conductive fluid in the space. Reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the space reduces the rate of oxidation of heater components in the space. The thermally conductive fluid is introduced in a specific volume and or to a selected pressure in the space. Thermally conductive fluid may be introduced such that the space has at least a minimum volume percentage of thermally conductive fluid above a selected value. In certain embodiments the space has at least 50 75 or 90 by volume of thermally conductive fluid.

Placing thermally conductive fluid inside the space of the temperature limited heater increases thermal heat transfer in the space. The increased thermal heat transfer is caused by reducing resistance to heat transfer in the space with the thermally conductive fluid. Reducing resistance to heat transfer in the space allows for increased power output from the temperature limited heater to the subsurface formation. Reducing the resistance to heat transfer inside the space with the thermally conductive fluid allows for smaller diameter electrical conductors for example a smaller diameter inner conductor a smaller diameter outer conductor and or a smaller diameter conduit a larger outer radius for example a larger radius of a conduit or a jacket and or an increased space width. Reducing the diameter of electrical conductors reduces material costs. Increasing the outer radius of the conduit or the jacket and or increasing the annulus space width provides additional annular space. Additional annular space may accommodate deformation of the conduit and or the jacket without causing heater failure. Increasing the outer radius of the conduit or the jacket and or increasing the annulus width may provide additional annular space to protect components for example spacers connectors and or conduits in the annulus.

As the annular width of the temperature limited heater is increased however greater heat transfer is needed across the annular space to maintain good heat output properties for the heater. In some embodiments especially for low temperature heaters radiative heat transfer is minimally effective in transferring heat across the annular space of the heater. Conductive heat transfer in the annular space is important in such embodiments to maintain good heat output properties for the heater. A thermally conductive fluid provides increased heat transfer across the annular space.

In certain embodiments the thermally conductive fluid located in the space is also electrically insulating to inhibit arcing between conductors in the temperature limited heater. Arcing across the space or gap is a problem with longer heaters that require higher operating voltages. Arcing may be a problem with shorter heaters and or at lower voltages depending on the operating conditions of the heater. Increasing the pressure of the fluid in the space increases the spark gap breakdown voltage in the space and inhibits arcing across the space. Certain gases such as SFor N have greater resistance to electrical breakdown but have lower thermal conductivities than helium or hydrogen because of their higher molecular weights. Thus gases such as SFor Nmay be less desirable in some embodiments.

Pressure of thermally conductive fluid in the space may be increased to a pressure between 200 kPa and 60 000 kPa between 500 kPa and 50 000 kPa between 700 kPa and 45 000 kPa or between 1000 kPa and 40 000 kPa. In an embodiment the pressure of the thermally conductive fluid is increased to at least 700 kPa or at least 1000 kPa. In certain embodiments the pressure of the thermally conductive fluid needed to inhibit arcing across the space depends on the temperature in the space. Electrons may track along surfaces for example insulators connectors or shields in the space and cause arcing or electrical degradation of the surfaces. High pressure fluid in the space may inhibit electron tracking along surfaces in the space. Helium has about one seventh the breakdown voltage of air at atmospheric pressure. Thus higher pressures of helium for example 7 atm 707 kPa or greater of helium may be used to compensate for the lower breakdown voltage of helium as compared to air.

Temperature limited heaters may be used for heating hydrocarbon formations including but not limited to oil shale formations coal formations tar sands formations and formations with heavy viscous oils. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in the field of environmental remediation to vaporize or destroy soil contaminants. Embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be used to heat fluids in a wellbore or sub sea pipeline to inhibit deposition of paraffin or various hydrates. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater is used for solution mining a subsurface formation for example an oil shale or a coal formation . In certain embodiments a fluid for example molten salt is placed in a wellbore and heated with a temperature limited heater to inhibit deformation and or collapse of the wellbore. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is attached to a sucker rod in the wellbore or is part of the sucker rod itself. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are used to heat a near wellbore region to reduce near wellbore oil viscosity during production of high viscosity crude oils and during transport of high viscosity oils to the surface. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater enables gas lifting of a viscous oil by lowering the viscosity of the oil without coking the oil. Temperature limited heaters may be used in sulfur transfer lines to maintain temperatures between about 110 C. and about 130 C.

Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be used in chemical or refinery processes at elevated temperatures that require control in a narrow temperature range to inhibit unwanted chemical reactions or damage from locally elevated temperatures. Some applications may include but are not limited to reactor tubes cokers and distillation towers. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in pollution control devices for example catalytic converters and oxidizers to allow rapid heating to a control temperature without complex temperature control circuitry. Additionally temperature limited heaters may be used in food processing to avoid damaging food with excessive temperatures. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in the heat treatment of metals for example annealing of weld joints . Temperature limited heaters may also be used in floor heaters cauterizers and or various other appliances. Temperature limited heaters may be used with biopsy needles to destroy tumors by raising temperatures in vivo.

Some embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be useful in certain types of medical and or veterinary devices. For example a temperature limited heater may be used to therapeutically treat tissue in a human or an animal. A temperature limited heater for a medical or veterinary device may have ferromagnetic material including a palladium copper alloy with a Curie temperature of about 50 C. A high frequency for example a frequency greater than about 1 MHz may be used to power a relatively small temperature limited heater for medical and or veterinary use.

The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Curie temperature data for various metals is listed in American Institute of Physics Handbook Second Edition McGraw Hill pages 5 170 through 5 176. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements iron cobalt and nickel and or alloys of these elements. In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductors include iron chromium Fe Cr alloys that contain tungsten W for example HCM12A and SAVE12 Sumitomo Metals Co. Japan and or iron alloys that contain chromium for example Fe Cr alloys Fe Cr W alloys Fe Cr V vanadium alloys and Fe Cr Nb Niobium alloys . Of the three main ferromagnetic elements iron has a Curie temperature of approximately 770 C. cobalt Co has a Curie temperature of approximately 1131 C. and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358 C. An iron cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example iron cobalt alloy with 2 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 800 C. iron cobalt alloy with 12 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 900 C. and iron cobalt alloy with 20 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 950 C. Iron nickel alloy has a Curie temperature lower than the Curie temperature of iron. For example iron nickel alloy with 20 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 720 C. and iron nickel alloy with 60 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 560 C.

Some non ferromagnetic elements used as alloys raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example an iron vanadium alloy with 5.9 by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815 C. Other non ferromagnetic elements for example carbon aluminum copper silicon and or chromium may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and or chemical properties. In some embodiments the Curie temperature material is a ferrite such as NiFeO. In other embodiments the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNior FeAl.

Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material. Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.

Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as the Curie temperature is approached. The Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry by C. James Erickson IEEE Press 1995 shows a typical curve for 1 carbon steel steel with 1 carbon by weight . The loss of magnetic permeability starts at temperatures above 650 C. and tends to be complete when temperatures exceed 730 C. Thus the self limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1 carbon steel is 0.132 cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720 C. From 720 C. to 730 C. the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1 carbon steel begins to self limit between 650 C. and 730 C.

Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time varying current into the conductive material. In general current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately 1 e of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth the skin depth is 1981.5 in which 2 

EQN. 2 is obtained from Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry by C. James Erickson IEEE Press 1995 . For most metals resistivity increases with temperature. The relative magnetic permeability generally varies with temperature and with current. Additional equations may be used to assess the variance of magnetic permeability and or skin depth on both temperature and or current. The dependence of on current arises from the dependence of on the magnetic field.

Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 10 1 30 1 or 50 1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used. A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located for example a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers and or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore for example temperature limits of heater materials . In some embodiments the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material for example adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature .

The temperature limited heater may provide a maximum heat output power output below the Curie temperature of the heater. In certain embodiments the maximum heat output is at least 400 W m Watts per meter 600 W m 700 W m 800 W m or higher up to 2000 W m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches or is above the Curie temperature. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W m 200 W m 100 W m or may approach 0 W m.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates substantially independently of the thermal load on the heater in a certain operating temperature range. Thermal load is the rate that heat is transferred from a heating system to its surroundings. It is to be understood that the thermal load may vary with temperature of the surroundings and or the thermal conductivity of the surroundings. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater operates at or above the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater such that the operating temperature of the heater increases at most by 3 C. 2 C. 1.5 C. 1 C. or 0.5 C. for a decrease in thermal load of 1 W m proximate to a portion of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates in such a manner at a relatively constant current.

The AC or modulated DC resistance and or the heat output of the temperature limited heater may decrease as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature and decrease sharply near or above the Curie temperature due to the Curie effect. In certain embodiments the value of the electrical resistance or heat output above or near the Curie temperature is at most one half of the value of electrical resistance or heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the heat output above or near the Curie temperature is at most 90 70 50 30 20 10 or less down to 1 of the heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature . In certain embodiments the electrical resistance above or near the Curie temperature decreases to 80 70 60 50 or less down to 1 of the electrical resistance at a certain point below the Curie temperature for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature .

In some embodiments AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. For example the skin depth of 1 carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz 0.0762 cm at 180 Hz and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the skin depth using a higher frequency and thus a heater with a smaller diameter reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry the higher frequency results in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz between 140 Hz and 200 Hz or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used for example 180 Hz 540 Hz or 720 Hz . In some embodiments high frequencies may be used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.

To maintain a substantially constant skin depth until the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater is reached the heater may be operated at a lower frequency when the heater is cold and operated at a higher frequency when the heater is hot. Line frequency heating is generally favorable however because there is less need for expensive components such as power supplies transformers or current modulators that alter frequency. Line frequency is the frequency of a general supply of current. Line frequency is typically 60 Hz but may be 50 Hz or another frequency depending on the source for the supply of the current. Higher frequencies may be produced using commercially available equipment such as solid state variable frequency power supplies. Transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power with three times the frequency are commercially available. For example high voltage three phase power at 60 Hz may be transformed to single phase power at 180 Hz and at a lower voltage. Such transformers are less expensive and more energy efficient than solid state variable frequency power supplies. In certain embodiments transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power are used to increase the frequency of power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments modulated DC for example chopped DC waveform modulated DC or cycled DC may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current. In some embodiments the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC to DC converter system. DC to DC converter systems are generally known in the art. DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include but are not limited to square wave sinusoidal deformed sinusoidal deformed square wave triangular and other regular or irregular waveforms.

The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus the modulated DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and or the rate of modulation such as the rate of chopping of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For example modulated DC may be provided at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing the frequency of supplied current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments electrical power for the temperature limited heater is initially supplied using non modulated DC or very low frequency modulated DC. Using DC or low frequency DC at earlier times of heating reduces inefficiencies associated with higher frequencies. DC and or low frequency modulated DC may also be cheaper to use during initial heating times. After a selected temperature is reached in a temperature limited heater modulated DC higher frequency modulated DC or AC is used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater so that the heat output will decrease near at or above the Curie temperature.

In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties for example subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example as the temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases it may be advantageous to increase the frequency of the current provided to the heater thus increasing the turndown ratio of the heater. In an embodiment the downhole temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore is assessed.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is varied to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of the temperature limited heater. For example the turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.

At or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material a relatively small change in voltage may cause a relatively large change in current to the load. The relatively small change in voltage may produce problems in the power supplied to the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature. The problems include but are not limited to reducing the power factor tripping a circuit breaker and or blowing a fuse. In some cases voltage changes may be caused by a change in the load of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments an electrical current supply for example a supply of modulated DC or AC provides a relatively constant amount of current that does not substantially vary with changes in load of the temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the electrical current supply provides an amount of electrical current that remains within 15 within 10 within 5 or within 2 of a selected constant current value when a load of the temperature limited heater changes.

Temperature limited heaters may generate an inductive load. The inductive load is due to some applied electrical current being used by the ferromagnetic material to generate a magnetic field in addition to generating a resistive heat output. As downhole temperature changes in the temperature limited heater the inductive load of the heater changes due to changes in the ferromagnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials in the heater with temperature. The inductive load of the temperature limited heater may cause a phase shift between the current and the voltage applied to the heater.

A reduction in actual power applied to the temperature limited heater may be caused by a time lag in the current waveform for example the current has a phase shift relative to the voltage due to an inductive load and or by distortions in the current waveform for example distortions in the current waveform caused by introduced harmonics due to a non linear load . Thus it may take more current to apply a selected amount of power due to phase shifting or waveform distortion. The ratio of actual power applied and the apparent power that would have been transmitted if the same current were in phase and undistorted is the power factor. The power factor is always less than or equal to 1. The power factor is 1 when there is no phase shift or distortion in the waveform.

in which P is the actual power applied to a heater I is the applied current V is the applied voltage and is the phase angle difference between voltage and current. Other phenomena such as waveform distortion may contribute to further lowering of the power factor. If there is no distortion in the waveform then cos is equal to the power factor.

At higher frequencies for example modulated DC frequencies of at least 1000 Hz 1500 Hz or 2000 Hz the problem with phase shifting and or distortion is more pronounced. In certain embodiments a capacitor is used to compensate for phase shifting caused by the inductive load. Capacitive load may be used to balance the inductive load because current for capacitance is 180 degrees out of phase from current for inductance. In some embodiments a variable capacitor for example a solid state switching capacitor is used to compensate for phase shifting caused by a varying inductive load. In an embodiment the variable capacitor is placed at the wellhead for the temperature limited heater. Placing the variable capacitor at the wellhead allows the capacitance to be varied more easily in response to changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the variable capacitor is placed subsurface with the temperature limited heater subsurface within the heater or as close to the heating conductor as possible to minimize line losses due to the capacitor. In some embodiments the variable capacitor is placed at a central location for a field of heater wells in some embodiments one variable capacitor may be used for several temperature limited heaters . In one embodiment the variable capacitor is placed at the electrical junction between the field of heaters and the utility supply of electricity.

In certain embodiments the variable capacitor is used to maintain the power factor of the temperature limited heater or the power factor of the electrical conductors in the temperature limited heater above a selected value. In some embodiments the variable capacitor is used to maintain the power factor of the temperature limited heater above the selected value of 0.85 0.9 or 0.95. In certain embodiments the capacitance in the variable capacitor is varied to maintain the power factor of the temperature limited heater above the selected value.

In some embodiments the modulated DC waveform is pre shaped to compensate for phase shifting and or harmonic distortion. The waveform may be pre shaped by modulating the waveform into a specific shape. For example the DC modulator is programmed or designed to output a waveform of a particular shape. In certain embodiments the pre shaped waveform is varied to compensate for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater caused by changes in the phase shift and or the harmonic distortion. Electrical measurements may be used to assess the phase shift and or the harmonic distortion. In certain embodiments heater conditions for example downhole temperature or pressure are assessed and used to determine the pre shaped waveform. In some embodiments the pre shaped waveform is determined through the use of a simulation or calculations based on the heater design. Simulations and or heater conditions may also be used to determine the capacitance needed for the variable capacitor.

In some embodiments the modulated DC waveform modulates DC between 100 full current load and 0 no current load . For example a square wave may modulate 100 A DC between 100 100 A and 0 0 A full wave modulation between 100 100 A and 50 50 A or between 75 75 A and 25 25 A . The lower current load for example the 0 25 or 50 current load may be defined as the base current load.

Generally a temperature limited heater designed for higher voltage and lower current will have a smaller skin depth. Decreasing the current may decrease the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. The smaller skin depth allows the temperature limited heater to have a smaller diameter thereby reducing equipment costs. In certain embodiments the applied current is at least 1 amp 10 amps 70 amps 100 amps 200 amps 500 amps or greater up to 2000 amps. In some embodiments current is supplied at voltages above 200 volts above 480 volts above 650 volts above 1000 volts above 1500 volts or higher up to 10000 volts.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes an inner conductor inside an outer conductor. The inner conductor and the outer conductor are radially disposed about a central axis. The inner and outer conductors may be separated by an insulation layer. In certain embodiments the inner and outer conductors are coupled at the bottom of the temperature limited heater. Electrical current may flow into the temperature limited heater through the inner conductor and return through the outer conductor. One or both conductors may include ferromagnetic material.

The insulation layer may comprise an electrically insulating ceramic with high thermal conductivity such as magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. The insulating layer may be a compacted powder for example compacted ceramic powder . Compaction may improve thermal conductivity and provide better insulation resistance. For lower temperature applications polymer insulation made from for example fluoropolymers polyimides polyamides and or polyethylenes may be used. In some embodiments the polymer insulation is made of perfluoroalkoxy PFA or polyetheretherketone PEEK Victrex Ltd England . The insulating layer may be chosen to be substantially infrared transparent to aid heat transfer from the inner conductor to the outer conductor. In an embodiment the insulating layer is transparent quartz sand. The insulation layer may be air or a non reactive gas such as helium nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride. If the insulation layer is air or a non reactive gas there may be insulating spacers designed to inhibit electrical contact between the inner conductor and the outer conductor. The insulating spacers may be made of for example high purity aluminum oxide or another thermally conducting electrically insulating material such as silicon nitride. The insulating spacers may be a fibrous ceramic material such as Nextel 312 3M Corporation St. Paul Minn. U.S.A. mica tape or glass fiber. Ceramic material may be made of alumina alumina silicate alumina borosilicate silicon nitride boron nitride or other materials.

The insulation layer may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. For example if the insulation layer is a solid or compacted material that substantially fills the space between the inner and outer conductors the temperature limited heater may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. Forces on the outer conductor can be transmitted through the insulation layer to the solid inner conductor which may resist crushing. Such a temperature limited heater may be bent dog legged and spiraled without causing the outer conductor and the inner conductor to electrically short to each other. Deformation tolerance may be important if the wellbore is likely to undergo substantial deformation during heating of the formation.

In certain embodiments an outermost layer of the temperature limited heater for example the outer conductor is chosen for corrosion resistance yield strength and or creep resistance. In one embodiment austenitic non ferromagnetic stainless steels such as 201 304H 347H 347HH 316H 310H 347HP NF709 Nippon Steel Corp. Japan stainless steels or combinations thereof may be used in the outer conductor. The outermost layer may also include a clad conductor. For example a corrosion resistant alloy such as 800H or 347H stainless steel may be clad for corrosion protection over a ferromagnetic carbon steel tubular. If high temperature strength is not required the outermost layer may be constructed from ferromagnetic metal with good corrosion resistance such as one of the ferritic stainless steels. In one embodiment a ferritic alloy of 82.3 by weight iron with 17.7 by weight chromium Curie temperature of 678 C. provides desired corrosion resistance.

In temperature limited heater embodiments with both an inner ferromagnetic conductor and an outer ferromagnetic conductor the skin effect current path occurs on the outside of the inner conductor and on the inside of the outer conductor. Thus the outside of the outer conductor may be clad with the corrosion resistant alloy such as stainless steel without affecting the skin effect current path on the inside of the outer conductor.

A ferromagnetic conductor with a thickness of at least the skin depth at the Curie temperature allows a substantial decrease in resistance of the ferromagnetic material as the skin depth increases sharply near the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments when the ferromagnetic conductor is not clad with a highly conducting material such as copper the thickness of the conductor may be 1.5 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature 3 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature or even 10 or more times the skin depth near the Curie temperature. If the ferromagnetic conductor is clad with copper thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be substantially the same as the skin depth near the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor clad with copper has a thickness of at least three fourths of the skin depth near the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a composite conductor with a ferromagnetic tubular and a non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core. The non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core reduces a required diameter of the conductor. For example the conductor may be composite 1.19 cm diameter conductor with a core of 0.575 cm diameter copper clad with a 0.298 cm thickness of ferritic stainless steel or carbon steel surrounding the core. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may be copper or copper alloy. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may also be made of other metals that exhibit low electrical resistivity and relative magnetic permeabilities near 1 for example substantially non ferromagnetic materials such as aluminum and aluminum alloys phosphor bronze beryllium copper and or brass . A composite conductor allows the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater to decrease more steeply near the Curie temperature. As the skin depth increases near the Curie temperature to include the copper core the electrical resistance decreases very sharply.

The composite conductor may increase the conductivity of the temperature limited heater and or allow the heater to operate at lower voltages. In an embodiment the composite conductor exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile at temperatures below a region near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor of the composite conductor. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile between 100 C. and 750 C. or between 300 C. and 600 C. The relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile may also be exhibited in other temperature ranges by adjusting for example materials and or the configuration of materials in the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in the composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in a composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for a temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the composite conductor is an inner conductor surrounded by 0.127 cm thick magnesium oxide powder as an insulator. The outer conductor may be 304H stainless steel with a wall thickness of 0.127 cm. The outside diameter of the heater may be about 1.65 cm.

A composite conductor for example a composite inner conductor or a composite outer conductor may be manufactured by methods including but not limited to coextrusion roll forming tight fit tubing for example cooling the inner member and heating the outer member then inserting the inner member in the outer member followed by a drawing operation and or allowing the system to cool explosive or electromagnetic cladding arc overlay welding longitudinal strip welding plasma powder welding billet coextrusion electroplating drawing sputtering plasma deposition coextrusion casting magnetic forming molten cylinder casting of inner core material inside the outer or vice versa insertion followed by welding or high temperature braising shielded active gas welding SAG and or insertion of an inner pipe in an outer pipe followed by mechanical expansion of the inner pipe by hydroforming or use of a pig to expand and swage the inner pipe against the outer pipe. In some embodiments a ferromagnetic conductor is braided over a non ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments composite conductors are formed using methods similar to those used for cladding for example cladding copper to steel . A metallurgical bond between copper cladding and base ferromagnetic material may be advantageous. Composite conductors produced by a coextrusion process that forms a good metallurgical bond for example a good bond between copper and 446 stainless steel may be provided by Anomet Products Inc. Shrewsbury Mass. U.S.A. .

Several methods may also be used to form a composite conductor of more than two conductors for example a three part composite conductor or a four part composite conductor . One method is to form two parts of the composite conductor by coextrusion and then swaging down the third and or fourth parts of the composite conductor onto the coextruded parts. A second method involves forming two or more parts of the composite conductor by coextrusion or another method bending a strip of the outer conductor around the formed parts and then welding the outer conductor together. The welding of the outer conductor may penetrate deep enough to create good electrical contact to the inner parts of the composite conductor. Another method is to swage all parts of the composite conductor onto one another either simultaneously or in two or more steps. In another method all parts of the composite conductor are coextruded simultaneously. In another method explosive cladding may be used to form a composite conductor. Explosive cladding may involve placing a first material in a second material and submerging the composite material in a substantially non compressible fluid. An explosive charge may be set off in the fluid to bind the first material to the second material.

In an embodiment two or more conductors are joined to form a composite conductor by various methods for example longitudinal strip welding to provide tight contact between the conducting layers. In certain embodiments two or more conducting layers and or insulating layers are combined to form a composite heater with layers selected such that the coefficient of thermal expansion decreases with each successive layer from the inner layer toward the outer layer. As the temperature of the heater increases the innermost layer expands to the greatest degree. Each successive outwardly lying layer expands to a slightly lesser degree with the outermost layer expanding the least. This sequential expansion may provide relatively intimate contact between layers for good electrical contact between layers.

In an embodiment two or more conductors are drawn together to form a composite conductor. In certain embodiments a relatively malleable ferromagnetic conductor for example iron such as 1018 steel may be used to form a composite conductor. A relatively soft ferromagnetic conductor typically has a low carbon content. A relatively malleable ferromagnetic conductor may be useful in drawing processes for forming composite conductors and or other processes that require stretching or bending of the ferromagnetic conductor. In a drawing process the ferromagnetic conductor may be annealed after one or more steps of the drawing process. The ferromagnetic conductor may be annealed in an inert gas atmosphere to inhibit oxidation of the conductor. In some embodiments oil is placed on the ferromagnetic conductor to inhibit oxidation of the conductor during processing.

The diameter of a temperature limited heater may be small enough to inhibit deformation of the heater by a collapsing formation. In certain embodiments the outside diameter of a temperature limited heater is less than about 5 cm. In some embodiments the outside diameter of a temperature limited heater is less than about 4 cm less than about 3 cm or between about 2 cm and about 5 cm.

In heater embodiments described herein including but not limited to temperature limited heaters insulated conductor heaters conductor in conduit heaters and elongated member heaters a largest transverse cross sectional dimension of a heater may be selected to provide a desired ratio of the largest transverse cross sectional dimension to wellbore diameter for example initial wellbore diameter . The largest transverse cross sectional dimension is the largest dimension of the heater on the same axis as the wellbore diameter for example the diameter of a cylindrical heater or the width of a vertical heater . In certain embodiments the ratio of the largest transverse cross sectional dimension to wellbore diameter is selected to be less than about 1 2 less than about 1 3 or less than about 1 4. The ratio of heater diameter to wellbore diameter may be chosen to inhibit contact and or deformation of the heater by the formation during heating. For example the ratio of heater diameter to wellbore diameter may be chosen to inhibit closing in of the wellbore on the heater during heating. In certain embodiments the wellbore diameter is determined by a diameter of a drill bit used to form the wellbore.

A wellbore diameter may shrink from an initial value of about 16.5 cm to about 6.4 cm during heating of a formation for example for a wellbore in oil shale with a richness greater than about 0.12 L kg . At some point expansion of formation material into the wellbore during heating results in a balancing between the hoop stress of the wellbore and the compressive strength due to thermal expansion of hydrocarbon or kerogen rich layers. The hoop stress of the wellbore itself may reduce the stress applied to a conduit for example a liner located in the wellbore. At this point the formation may no longer have the strength to deform or collapse a heater or a liner. For example the radial stress provided by formation material may be about 12 000 psi 82.7 MPa at a diameter of about 16.5 cm while the stress at a diameter of about 6.4 cm after expansion may be about 3000 psi 20.7 MPa . A heater diameter may be selected to be less than about 3.8 cm to inhibit contact of the formation and the heater. A temperature limited heater may advantageously provide a higher heat output over a significant portion of the wellbore for example the heat output needed to provide sufficient heat to pyrolyze hydrocarbons in a hydrocarbon containing formation than a constant wattage heater for smaller heater diameters for example less than about 5.1 cm .

Inner conductor may be placed inside ingot . Inner conductor may be a non ferromagnetic conductor for example copper or aluminum that melts at a lower temperature than ingot . In an embodiment ingot may be heated to a temperature above the melting point of inner conductor and below the melting point of the ingot. Inner conductor may melt and substantially fill the space inside ingot for example the inner annulus of the ingot . A cap may be placed at the bottom of ingot to inhibit inner conductor from flowing and or leaking out of the inner annulus of the ingot. After inner conductor has sufficiently melted to substantially fill the inner annulus of ingot the inner conductor and the ingot may be allowed to cool to room temperature. Ingot and inner conductor may be cooled at a relatively slow rate to allow inner conductor to form a good soldering bond with ingot . The rate of cooling may depend on for example the types of materials used for the ingot and the inner conductor.

In some embodiments a composite conductor may be formed by tube in tube milling of dual metal strips such as the process performed by Precision Tube Technology Houston Tex. U.S.A. . A tube in tube milling process may also be used to form cladding on a conductor for example copper cladding inside carbon steel or to form two materials into a tight fit tube within a tube configuration.

In a tube in tube milling process flat strips of material for the outer conductor may have a thickness substantially equal to the desired wall thickness of the outer conductor. The width of the strips may allow formation of a tube of a desired inner diameter. The flat strips may be welded end to end to form an outer conductor of a desired length. Flat strips of material for the inner conductor may be cut such that the inner conductor formed from the strips fit inside the outer conductor. The flat strips of inner conductor material may be welded together end to end to achieve a length substantially the same as the desired length of the outer conductor. The flat strips for the outer conductor and the flat strips for the inner conductor may be fed into separate accumulators. Both accumulators may be coupled to a tube mill. The two flat strips may be sandwiched together at the beginning of the tube mill.

The tube mill may form the flat strips into a tube in tube shape. After the tube in tube shape has been formed a non contact high frequency induction welder may heat the ends of the strips of the outer conductor to a forging temperature of the outer conductor. The ends of the strips then may be brought together to forge weld the ends of the outer conductor into a weld bead. Excess weld bead material may be cut off. In some embodiments the tube in tube produced by the tube mill is further processed for example annealed and or pressed to achieve a desired size and or shape. The result of the tube in tube process may be an inner conductor in an outer conductor as shown in .

In an embodiment ferromagnetic section is 446 stainless steel with a thickness of 0.9 cm. Jacket is 410 stainless steel with a thickness of 0.6 cm. 410 stainless steel has a higher Curie temperature than 446 stainless steel. Such a temperature limited heater may contain current such that the current does not easily flow from the heater to the surrounding formation and or to any surrounding water for example brine groundwater or formation water . In this embodiment a majority of the current flows through ferromagnetic section until the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic section is reached. After the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic section is reached a majority of the current flows through conductive layer . The ferromagnetic properties of jacket 410 stainless steel inhibit the current from flowing outside the jacket and contain the current. Jacket may also have a thickness that provides strength to the temperature limited heater.

The heating section of the temperature limited heater includes non ferromagnetic inner conductors and a ferromagnetic outer conductor. The overburden section of the temperature limited heater includes a non ferromagnetic outer conductor. and depict transverse cross sectional views of the embodiment shown in . Inner conductor is copper with a diameter of 1.0 cm. Electrical insulator is placed between inner conductor and conductive layer . Electrical insulator includes compacted silicon nitride boron nitride or magnesium oxide powder with a thickness of 0.1 cm to 0.3 cm. Conductive layer is copper with a thickness of 0.1 cm. Insulation layer is in the annulus outside of conductive layer . The thickness of the annulus may be 0.3 cm. Insulation layer is quartz sand.

Heating section may provide heat to one or more hydrocarbon layers in the formation. Heating section includes ferromagnetic material such as 409 stainless steel or 410 stainless steel. Heating section has a thickness of 0.9 cm. Endcap is coupled to an end of heating section . Endcap electrically couples heating section to inner conductor and or conductive layer . Endcap is 304 stainless steel. Heating section is coupled to overburden section . Overburden section includes carbon steel and or other suitable support materials. Overburden section has a thickness of 0.6 cm. Overburden section is lined with conductive layer . Conductive layer is copper with a thickness of 0.3 cm.

In an embodiment a temperature limited heater includes triaxial conductors. and depict cross sectional representations of an embodiment of a temperature limited heater with triaxial conductors. Inner conductor may be copper or another highly conductive material. Electrical insulator may be silicon nitride boron nitride or magnesium oxide in certain embodiments as compacted powders . Middle conductor may include ferromagnetic material for example 446 stainless steel . In the embodiment of outer conductor is separated from middle conductor by electrical insulator . Outer conductor may include corrosion resistant electrically conductive material for example stainless steel . In some embodiments electrical insulator is a space between conductors for example an air gap or other gas gap that electrically insulates the conductors for example conductors and may be in a conductor in conduit in conduit arrangement .

In a temperature limited heater with triaxial conductors such as depicted in electrical current may propagate through two conductors in one direction and through the third conductor in an opposite direction. In electrical current may propagate in through middle conductor in one direction and return through inner conductor and outer conductor in an opposite direction as shown by the arrows in and the signs in . In an embodiment electrical current is split approximately in half between inner conductor and outer conductor . Splitting the electrical current between inner conductor and outer conductor causes current propagating through middle conductor to flow through both inside and outside skin depths of the middle conductor.

Current flows through both the inside and outside skin depths due to reduced magnetic field intensity from the current being split between the outer conductor and the inner conductor. Reducing the magnetic field intensity allows the skin depth of middle conductor to remain relatively small with the same magnetic permeability. Thus the thinner inside and outside skin depths may produce an increased Curie effect compared to the same thickness of ferromagnetic material with only one skin depth. The thinner inside and outside skin depths may produce a sharper turndown than one single skin depth in the same ferromagnetic material. Splitting the current between outer conductor and inner conductor may allow a thinner middle conductor to produce the same Curie effect as a thicker middle conductor. In certain embodiments the materials and thicknesses used for outer conductor inner conductor and middle conductor have to be balanced to produce desired results in the Curie effect and turndown ratio of a triaxial temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments the conductor for example an inner conductor an outer conductor or a ferromagnetic conductor is the composite conductor that includes two or more different materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes two or more ferromagnetic materials. In some embodiments the composite ferromagnetic conductor includes two or more radially disposed materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes a ferromagnetic conductor and a non ferromagnetic conductor. In some embodiments the composite conductor includes the ferromagnetic conductor placed over a non ferromagnetic core. Two or more materials may be used to obtain a relatively flat electrical resistivity versus temperature profile in a temperature region below the Curie temperature and or a sharp decrease a high turndown ratio in the electrical resistivity at or near the Curie temperature. In some cases two or more materials are used to provide more than one Curie temperature for the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments a composite electrical conductor is formed using a billet coextrusion process. A billet coextrusion process may include coupling together two or more electrical conductors at relatively high temperatures for example at temperatures that are near or above 75 of the melting temperature of a conductor . The electrical conductors may be drawn together at the relatively high temperatures for example under vacuum . Coextrusion at high temperatures under vacuum exposes fresh metal surfaces during drawing while inhibiting oxidation of the metal surfaces. This type of coextrusion improves the metallurgical bond between coextruded metals. The drawn together conductors may then be cooled to form a composite electrical conductor made from the two or more electrical conductors. In some embodiments the composite electrical conductor is a solid composite electrical conductor. In certain embodiments the composite electrical conductor may be a tubular composite electrical conductor.

In one embodiment a copper core is billet coextruded with a stainless steel conductor for example 446 stainless steel . The copper core and the stainless steel conductor may be heated to a softening temperature in vacuum. At the softening temperature the stainless steel conductor may be drawn over the copper core to form a tight fit. The stainless steel conductor and copper core may then be cooled to form a composite electrical conductor with the stainless steel surrounding the copper core.

In some embodiments a long composite electrical conductor is formed from several sections of composite electrical conductor. The sections of composite electrical conductor may be formed by a billet coextrusion process. The sections of composite electrical conductor may be coupled using a welding process. and depict embodiments of coupled sections of composite electrical conductors. In core extends beyond the ends of inner conductor in each section of a composite electrical conductor. In an embodiment core is copper and inner conductor is 446 stainless steel. Cores from each section of the composite electrical conductor may be coupled by for example brazing the core ends together. Core coupling material may couple the core ends as shown in . Core coupling material may be for example Everdur a copper silicon alloy material for example an alloy with about 3 by weight silicon in copper . Alternatively the copper core may be autogenously welded or filled with copper.

Inner conductor coupling material may couple inner conductors from each section of the composite electrical conductor. Inner conductor coupling material may be material used for welding sections of inner conductor together. In certain embodiments inner conductor coupling material may be used for welding stainless steel inner conductor sections together. In some embodiments inner conductor coupling material is 304 stainless steel or 310 stainless steel. A third material for example 309 stainless steel may be used to couple inner conductor coupling material to ends of inner conductor . The third material may be needed or desired to produce a better bond for example a better weld between inner conductor and inner conductor coupling material . The third material may be non magnetic to reduce the potential for a hot spot to occur at the coupling.

In certain embodiments inner conductor coupling material surrounds the ends of cores that protrude beyond the ends of inner conductors as shown in . Inner conductor coupling material may include one or more coupled portions. Inner conductor coupling material may be placed in a clam shell configuration around the ends of cores that protrude beyond the ends of inner conductors as shown in the end view depicted in . Coupling material may be used to couple together portions for example halves of inner conductor coupling material . Coupling material may be the same material as inner conductor coupling material or another material suitable for coupling together portions of the inner conductor coupling material.

In some embodiments a composite electrical conductor includes inner conductor coupling material with 304 stainless steel or 310 stainless steel and inner conductor with 446 stainless steel or another ferromagnetic material. In such an embodiment inner conductor coupling material produces significantly less heat than inner conductor . The portions of the composite electrical conductor that include the inner conductor coupling material for example the welded portions or joints of the composite electrical conductor may remain at lower temperatures than adjacent material during application of applied electrical current to the composite electrical conductor. The reliability and durability of the composite electrical conductor may be increased by keeping the joints of the composite electrical conductor at lower temperatures.

The composite electrical conductor may be used as the conductor in any electrical heater embodiment described herein. For example the composite conductor may be used as the conductor in a conductor in conduit heater or an insulated conductor heater. In certain embodiments the composite conductor may be coupled to a support member such as a support conductor. The support member may be used to provide support to the composite conductor so that the composite conductor is not relied upon for strength at or near the Curie temperature. The support member may be useful for heaters of lengths of at least 100 m. The support member may be a non ferromagnetic member that has good high temperature creep strength. Examples of materials that are used for a support member include but are not limited to Haynes 625 alloy and Haynes HR120 alloy Haynes International Kokomo Ind. U.S.A. NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy and 347HP alloy Allegheny Ludlum Corp. Pittsburgh Pa. U.S.A. . In some embodiments materials in a composite conductor are directly coupled for example brazed metallurgically bonded or swaged to each other and or the support member. Using a support member may reduce the need for the ferromagnetic member to provide support for the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature. Thus the temperature limited heater may be designed with more flexibility in the selection of ferromagnetic materials.

In certain embodiments the diameter of core is adjusted relative to a constant outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. For example the diameter of core may be increased to 1.14 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor at 1.9 cm to increase the turndown ratio of the heater.

In some embodiments conductors for example core and ferromagnetic conductor in the composite conductor are separated by support member . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor with support member separating the conductors. In one embodiment core is copper with a diameter of 0.95 cm support member is 347H alloy with an outside diameter of 1.9 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm. The support member depicted in has a lower creep strength relative to the support members depicted in .

In certain embodiments support member is located inside the composite conductor. depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . Support member is made of 347H alloy. Inner conductor is copper. Ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel. In one embodiment support member is 1.25 cm diameter 347H alloy inner conductor is 1.9 cm outside diameter copper and ferromagnetic conductor is 2.7 cm outside diameter 446 stainless steel. The turndown ratio is higher than the turndown ratio for the embodiments depicted in and for the same outside diameter but it has a lower creep strength.

In some embodiments the thickness of inner conductor which is copper is reduced and the thickness of support member is increased to increase the creep strength at the expense of reduced turndown ratio. For example the diameter of support member is increased to 1.6 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of inner conductor at 1.9 cm to reduce the thickness of the conduit. This reduction in thickness of inner conductor results in a decreased turndown ratio relative to the thicker inner conductor embodiment but an increased creep strength.

In one embodiment support member is a conduit or pipe inside inner conductor and ferromagnetic conductor . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . In one embodiment support member is 347H alloy with a 0.63 cm diameter center hole. In some embodiments support member is a preformed conduit. In certain embodiments support member is formed by having a dissolvable material for example copper dissolvable by nitric acid located inside the support member during formation of the composite conductor. The dissolvable material is dissolved to form the hole after the conductor is assembled. In an embodiment support member is 347H alloy with an inside diameter of 0.63 cm and an outside diameter of 1.6 cm inner conductor is copper with an outside diameter of 1.8 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm.

In certain embodiments the composite electrical conductor is used as the conductor in the conductor in conduit heater. For example the composite electrical conductor may be used as conductor in

Conduit is made of an electrically conductive material. Conduit is disposed in opening in hydrocarbon layer . Opening has a diameter that accommodates conduit .

Conductor may be centered in conduit by centralizers . Centralizers electrically isolate conductor from conduit . Centralizers inhibit movement and properly locate conductor in conduit . Centralizers are made of ceramic material or a combination of ceramic and metallic materials. Centralizers inhibit deformation of conductor in conduit . Centralizers are touching or spaced at intervals between approximately 0.1 m meters and approximately 3 m or more along conductor .

A second low resistance section of conductor may couple conductor to wellhead as depicted in . Electrical current may be applied to conductor from power cable through low resistance section of conductor . Electrical current passes from conductor through sliding connector to conduit . Conduit may be electrically insulated from overburden casing and from wellhead to return electrical current to power cable . Heat may be generated in conductor and conduit . The generated heat may radiate in conduit and opening to heat at least a portion of hydrocarbon layer .

Overburden casing may be disposed in overburden . Overburden casing is in some embodiments surrounded by materials for example reinforcing material and or cement that inhibit heating of overburden . Low resistance section of conductor may be placed in overburden casing . Low resistance section of conductor is made of for example carbon steel. Low resistance section of conductor may be centralized in overburden casing using centralizers . Centralizers are spaced at intervals of approximately 6 m to approximately 12 m or for example approximately 9 m along low resistance section of conductor . In a heater embodiment low resistance section of conductor is coupled to conductor by one or more welds. In other heater embodiments low resistance sections are threaded threaded and welded or otherwise coupled to the conductor. Low resistance section generates little or no heat in overburden casing . Packing may be placed between overburden casing and opening . Packing may be used as a cap at the junction of overburden and hydrocarbon layer to allow filling of materials in the annulus between overburden casing and opening . In some embodiments packing inhibits fluid from flowing from opening to surface .

Water or other fluids inside conduit can adversely affect heating using the conductor in conduit heater. In certain embodiments fluid inside conduit is removed to reduce the pressure inside the conduit. The fluid may be removed by vacuum pumping or other means for reducing the pressure inside conduit . In some embodiments the pressure is reduced outside conduit and inside opening . In certain embodiments the space inside conduit or the space outside the conduit is vacuum pumped to a pressure below the vapor pressure of water at the downhole temperature of the conduit. For example at a downhole temperature of 25 C. the space inside or outside conduit would be vacuum pumped to a pressure below about 101 kPa.

In certain embodiments the space inside or outside conduit is vacuum pumped to a pressure below the vapor pressure of water at ice temperatures. The vapor pressure of ice at 0 C. is 610 Pa. As conduit is vacuum pumped water in the conduit gets colder until the water freezes. Thus vacuum pumping to a pressure below the vapor pressure of water at ice temperatures indicates that most or all of the water has been removed from the space inside or outside conduit . In certain embodiments high pumping capacity vacuum pumps for example a Kinney CB245 vacuum pump available from Tuthill Co. Burr Ridge Ill. U.S.A. are used to vacuum pump below pressures of about 1 Pa. In some embodiments a vacuum gauge is coupled between the vacuum pump and the wellhead for the heater. In some embodiments a cold trap for example a dry ice trap or liquid nitrogen trap is placed between conduit and the vacuum pump to condense water from the conduit and inhibit water from contaminating pump oil.

As pressure in conduit is decreased ice in the conduit gets colder and the vapor pressure of the ice further decreases. For example the vapor pressure of ice at 10 C. is 260 Pa. Thus in certain embodiments the space inside or outside conduit is vacuum pumped to a pressure below 1 kPa below 750 Pa below 600 Pa below 500 Pa below 100 Pa 15 Pa below 10 Pa below 5 Pa or less. Vacuum pumping to such pressures improves the removal of water from conduit .

In some embodiments conduit is vacuum pumped to a selected pressure and then the conduit is closed off pressure sealed for example by closing a valve on the wellhead. The pressure in conduit is monitored for any pressure rise. If the pressure rises to a value near the vapor pressure of water or ice and at least temporarily stabilizes there is most likely more water in the conduit and the conduit is then vacuum pumped again. If the pressure does not rise up to the vapor pressure of ice or water then conduit is considered dry. If the pressure continuously rises to pressures above the vapor pressure of ice or water then there may be a leak in conduit causing the pressure rise.

In certain embodiments heat is provided by conductor and or conduit during vacuum pumping of the conduit. The provided heat may increase the vapor pressure of water or ice in conduit . The provided heat may inhibit ice from forming in conduit . Providing heat in conduit may decrease the time needed to remove vacuum pump water from the conduit. Providing heat in conduit may increase the likelihood of removing substantially all the water from the conduit.

In some embodiments a non condensable gas for example dry nitrogen argon or helium is backfilled inside or outside conduit after vacuum pumping. In some embodiments the space inside or outside conduit is backfilled with the non condensable gas to a pressure between 101 kPa and 10 MPa between 202 kPa and 5 MPa or between 500 kPa and 1 MPa. In some embodiments the inside or outside of conduit is vacuum pumped for a time then backfilled with non condensable gas and then vacuum pumped again. This process may be repeated for several cycles to more completely remove water and other fluids from inside or outside conduit . In some embodiments conduit is operated with the backfilled non condensable gas remaining inside or outside the conduit.

In some embodiments a small amount of an oxidizing fluid such as oxygen is added to the non condensable gas backfilled in conduit . The oxidizing fluid may oxidize metals of conduit and or conductor . The oxidation may increase the emissivity of the conduit and or conductor metals. The small amount of oxidizing fluid may be between about 100 ppm and 25 ppm between about 75 ppm and 40 ppm or between about 60 ppm and 50 ppm in the non condensable gas. In one embodiment at most 50 ppm of oxidizing fluid is in the non condensable gas in conduit .

Sliding connector may include scraper . Scraper may abut an inner surface of conduit at point . Scraper may include any metal or electrically conducting material for example steel or stainless steel . Centralizer may couple to conductor . In some embodiments sliding connector is positioned on low resistance section of conductor . Centralizer may include any electrically conducting material for example a metal or metal alloy . Spring bow may couple scraper to centralizer . Spring bow may include any metal or electrically conducting material for example copper beryllium alloy . In some embodiments centralizer spring bow and or scraper are welded together.

More than one sliding connector may be used for redundancy and to reduce the current through each scraper . In addition a thickness of conduit may be increased for a length adjacent to sliding connector to reduce heat generated in that portion of conduit. The length of conduit with increased thickness may be for example approximately 6 m. In certain embodiments electrical contact may be made between centralizer and scraper shown in on sliding connector using an electrical conductor for example a copper wire that has a lower electrical resistance than spring bow . Electrical current may flow through the electrical conductor rather than spring bow so that the spring bow has a longer lifetime.

Return electrical current enters the upper contacting section through conduit . Conduit is electrically coupled to return cable through contactors . In certain embodiments liner is located on the inside of conduit to promote electrical contact between the conduit and contactors . In certain embodiments liner is copper. In some embodiments conduit includes one or more isolation subs . Isolation subs in conduit inhibit any current flow to sections above the contacting section of the conduit. Isolation subs may be for example fiberglass sections of conduit or electrically insulating epoxy threaded sections in the conduit.

Lead in cable and return cable may be 4 0 copper cable with TEFLON insulation. Using copper cables to make electrical contact in the upper contacting section may be less expensive than other contacting methods such as cladding. In certain embodiments more than one cable is used for lead in cable and or return cable . depicts an aerial view of the upper contact section of the conductor in conduit heater in with three lead in cables and three return cables . The cables are coupled to rod with strap . Centralizers maintain a position of rod in conduit . The lead in cables and return cables may be paired off in three pairs. Each pair may have one lead in cable and one return cable . Thus in each cable pair one cable carries current downwards lead in cables and one cable carries current upwards return cables . This opposite current flow in each pair reduces skin effect losses in the upper contacting section. In addition splitting the lead in and return current between several cables reduces electrical loss and heat loss in the upper contacting section.

In the lower contacting section shown in conductor is electrically coupled to conduit through contactors . In certain embodiments liner is located on the inside of conduit to promote electrical contact between the conduit and contactors .

In some embodiments a fiber optic system including an optical sensor is used to continuously monitor parameters for example temperature pressure and or strain along a portion and or the entire length of a heater assembly. In certain embodiments an optical sensor is used to monitor composition of gas at one or more locations along the optical sensor. The optical sensor may include but is not limited to a high temperature rated optical fiber for example a single mode fiber or a multimode fiber or fiber optic cable. A Sensornet DTS system Sensornet London U.K. includes an optical fiber that is used to monitor temperature along a length of a heater assembly. A Sensornet DTS system includes an optical fiber that is used to monitor temperature and strain and or pressure at the same time along a length of a heater assembly.

In some embodiments an optical sensor used to monitor temperature strain and or pressure is protected by positioning at least partially the optical sensor in a protective sleeve such as an enclosed tube resistant to conditions in a downhole environment. In certain embodiments the protective sleeve is a small stainless steel tube. In some embodiments an open ended sleeve is used to allow determination of gas composition at the surface and or at the terminal end of an oxidizer assembly. The optical sensor may be pre installed in a protective sleeve and coiled on a reel. The sleeve may be uncoiled from the reel and coupled to a heater assembly. In some embodiments an optical sensor in a protective sleeve is lowered into a section of the formation with a heater assembly.

In certain embodiments the sleeve is placed down a hollow conductor of a conductor in conduit heater. In some embodiments the fiber optic cable is a high temperature rated fiber optic cable. depicts an embodiment of sleeve in a conductor in conduit heater. Conductor may be a hollow conductor. Sleeve may be placed inside conductor . Sleeve may be moved to a position inside conductor by providing a pressurized fluid for example a pressurized inert gas into the conductor to move the sleeve along a length of the conductor. Sleeve may have a plug located at an end of the sleeve so that the sleeve is moved by the pressurized fluid. Plug may be of a diameter slightly smaller than an inside diameter of conductor so that the plug is allowed to move along the inside of the conductor. In some embodiments plug has small openings to allow some fluid to flow past the plug. Conductor may have an open end or a closed end with openings at the end to allow pressure release from the end of the conductor so that sleeve and plug can move along the inside of the conductor. Sleeve may be placed inside any hollow conduit or conductor in any type of heater.

Using a pressurized fluid to position sleeve inside conductor allows for selected positioning of the sleeve. The pressure of the fluid used to move sleeve inside conductor may be set to move the sleeve a selected distance in the conductor so that the sleeve is positioned as desired. In certain embodiments sleeve may be removable from conductor so that the sleeve can be repaired and or replaced.

Temperatures monitored by the fiber optic cable may depend upon positioning of sleeve . In certain embodiments sleeve is positioned in an annulus between the conduit and the conductor or between the conduit and an opening in the formation. In certain embodiments sleeve with enclosed fiber optic cable is wrapped spirally to enhance resolution.

In certain embodiments centralizers such as centralizers depicted in are made of silicon nitride. In some embodiments silicon nitride is gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride. Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride can be made by sintering the silicon nitride at 1800 C. in a 10.3 MPa nitrogen atmosphere to inhibit degradation of the silicon nitride during sintering. One example of a gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride is obtained from Ceradyne Inc. Costa Mesa Calif. U.S.A. as Ceralloy 147 31N.

Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride may be ground to a fine finish. The fine finish which gives a very low surface porosity of the silicon nitride allows the silicon nitride to slide easily along metal surfaces without picking up metal particles from the surfaces. Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride is a very dense material with high tensile strength high flexural mechanical strength and high thermal impact stress characteristics. Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride is an excellent high temperature electrical insulator. Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride has about the same leakage current at 900 C. as alumina AlO at 760 C. Gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride has a thermal conductivity of 25 watts per meter K. The relatively high thermal conductivity promotes heat transfer away from the center conductor of a conductor in conduit heater.

Other types of silicon nitride such as but not limited to reaction bonded silicon nitride or hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride may be used. Hot isostatic pressing includes sintering granular silicon nitride and additives at 100 200 MPa in nitrogen gas. Some silicon nitrides are made by sintering silicon nitride with yttrium oxide or cerium oxide to lower the sintering temperature so that the silicon nitride does not degrade for example by releasing nitrogen during sintering. However adding other material to the silicon nitride may increase the leakage current of the silicon nitride at elevated temperatures compared to purer forms of silicon nitride.

Conductor and ferromagnetic conductor are electrically coupled to conduit with sliding connector . Conduit is a non ferromagnetic material such as but not limited to 347H stainless steel. In one embodiment conduit is a 1 Schedule 80 347H stainless steel pipe. In another embodiment conduit is a Schedule XXH 347H stainless steel pipe. One or more centralizers maintain the gap between conduit and ferromagnetic conductor . In an embodiment centralizer is made of gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride. Centralizer may be held in position on ferromagnetic conductor by one or more weld tabs located on the ferromagnetic conductor.

In certain embodiments the composite electrical conductor may be used as a conductor in an insulated conductor heater. and depict an embodiment of the insulated conductor heater. Insulated conductor includes core and inner conductor . Core and inner conductor are a composite electrical conductor. Core and inner conductor are located within insulator . Core inner conductor and insulator are located inside outer conductor . Insulator is silicon nitride boron nitride magnesium oxide or another suitable electrical insulator. Outer conductor is copper steel or any other electrical conductor.

In certain embodiments insulator is a powdered insulator. In some embodiments insulator is an insulator with a preformed shape for example preformed half shells . Insulated conductor may be formed using several techniques known in the art. Examples of techniques for forming insulated conductors include a weld fill draw method or a fill draw method. Insulated conductors made using these techniques may be made by for example Tyco International Inc. Princeton N.J. U.S.A. or Watlow Electric Manufacturing Co. St. Louis Mo. U.S.A. .

In some embodiments jacket is located outside outer conductor as shown in and . In some embodiments jacket is 304 stainless steel and outer conductor is copper. Jacket provides corrosion resistance for the insulated conductor heater. In some embodiments jacket and outer conductor are preformed strips that are drawn over insulator to form insulated conductor .

In certain embodiments insulated conductor is located in a conduit that provides protection for example corrosion protection degradation protection and mechanical deformation protection for the insulated conductor. In insulated conductor is located inside conduit with gap separating the insulated conductor from the conduit.

For a temperature limited heater in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature a majority of the current flows through material with highly non linear functions of magnetic field H versus magnetic induction B . These non linear functions may cause strong inductive effects and distortion that lead to decreased power factor in the temperature limited heater at temperatures below the Curie temperature. These effects may render the electrical power supply to the temperature limited heater difficult to control and may result in additional current flow through surface and or overburden power supply conductors. Expensive and or difficult to implement control systems such as variable capacitors or modulated power supplies may be used to attempt to compensate for these effects and to control temperature limited heaters where the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by current flow through the ferromagnetic material.

In certain temperature limited heater embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to an electrical conductor coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor when the temperature limited heater is below or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor may be a sheath jacket support member corrosion resistant member or other electrically resistive member. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor positioned between an outermost layer and the ferromagnetic conductor. The ferromagnetic conductor is located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater such that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor at or below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor. The majority of the flow of electrical current is confined to the electrical conductor due to the skin effect of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the majority of the current is flowing through material with substantially linear resistive properties throughout most of the operating range of the heater.

In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor are located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater so that the skin effect of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of electrical current in the electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments the dimensions of the electrical conductor may be chosen to provide desired heat output characteristics.

Because the majority of the current flows through the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature the temperature limited heater has a resistance versus temperature profile that at least partially reflects the resistance versus temperature profile of the material in the electrical conductor. Thus the resistance versus temperature profile of the temperature limited heater is substantially linear below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor if the material in the electrical conductor has a substantially linear resistance versus temperature profile. For example the temperature limited heater in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature may have a resistance versus temperature profile similar to the profile shown in . The resistance of the temperature limited heater has little or no dependence on the current flowing through the heater until the temperature nears the Curie temperature. The majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature.

Resistance versus temperature profiles for temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor also tend to exhibit sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. For example the reduction in resistance shown in is sharper than the reduction in resistance shown in . The sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature are easier to control than more gradual resistance reductions near the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments the material and or the dimensions of the material in the electrical conductor are selected so that the temperature limited heater has a desired resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature are easier to predict and or control. Behavior of temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature may be predicted by for example its resistance versus temperature profile and or its power factor versus temperature profile. Resistance versus temperature profiles and or power factor versus temperature profiles may be assessed or predicted by for example experimental measurements that assess the behavior of the temperature limited heater analytical equations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater and or simulations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments assessed or predicted behavior of the temperature limited heater is used to control the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be controlled based on measurements assessments of the resistance and or the power factor during operation of the heater. In some embodiments the power or current supplied to the temperature limited heater is controlled based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater during operation of the heater and the comparison of this assessment versus the predicted behavior of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater is controlled without measurement of the temperature of the heater or a temperature near the heater. Controlling the temperature limited heater without temperature measurement eliminates operating costs associated with downhole temperature measurement. Controlling the temperature limited heater based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater also reduces the time for making adjustments in the power or current supplied to the heater compared to controlling the heater based on measured temperature.

As the temperature of the temperature limited heater approaches or exceeds the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor reduction in the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor allows electrical current to flow through a greater portion of the electrically conducting cross section of the temperature limited heater. Thus the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater is reduced and the temperature limited heater automatically provides reduced heat output at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments a highly electrically conductive member is coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor to reduce the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater at or above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The highly electrically conductive member may be an inner conductor a core or another conductive member of copper aluminum nickel or alloys thereof.

The ferromagnetic conductor that confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature may have a relatively small cross section compared to the ferromagnetic conductor in temperature limited heaters that use the ferromagnetic conductor to provide the majority of resistive heat output up to or near the Curie temperature. A temperature limited heater that uses the electrical conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature has low magnetic inductance at temperatures below the Curie temperature because less current is flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor as compared to the temperature limited heater where the majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature is provided by the ferromagnetic material. Magnetic field H at radius r of the ferromagnetic conductor is proportional to the current I flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor and the core divided by the radius or H I r. 4 

Since only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for a temperature limited heater that uses the outer conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater may be significantly smaller than the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater where the majority of the current flows through the ferromagnetic material. The relative magnetic permeability may be large for small magnetic fields.

The skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative magnetic permeability 1 . 5 

Increasing the relative magnetic permeability decreases the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor. However because only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for temperatures below the Curie temperature the radius or thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be decreased for ferromagnetic materials with large relative magnetic permeabilities to compensate for the decreased skin depth while still allowing the skin effect to limit the penetration depth of the electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The radius thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be between 0.3 mm and 8 mm between 0.3 mm and 2 mm or between 2 mm and 4 mm depending on the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor. Decreasing the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor decreases costs of manufacturing the temperature limited heater as the cost of ferromagnetic material tends to be a significant portion of the cost of the temperature limited heater. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor provides a higher turndown ratio and a sharper decrease in electrical resistance for the temperature limited heater at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Ferromagnetic materials such as purified iron or iron cobalt alloys with high relative magnetic permeabilities for example at least 200 at least 1000 at least 1 10 or at least 1 10 and or high Curie temperatures for example at least 600 C. at least 700 C. or at least 800 C. tend to have less corrosion resistance and or less mechanical strength at high temperatures. The electrical conductor may provide corrosion resistance and or high mechanical strength at high temperatures for the temperature limited heater. Thus the ferromagnetic conductor may be chosen primarily for its ferromagnetic properties.

Confining the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor reduces variations in the power factor. Because only a portion of the electrical current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature the non linear ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor have little or no effect on the power factor of the temperature limited heater except at or near the Curie temperature. Even at or near the Curie temperature the effect on the power factor is reduced compared to temperature limited heaters in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature. Thus there is less or no need for external compensation for example variable capacitors or waveform modification to adjust for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater to maintain a relatively high power factor.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater which confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor maintains the power factor above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater. Any reduction in the power factor occurs only in sections of the temperature limited heater at temperatures near the Curie temperature. Most sections of the temperature limited heater are typically not at or near the Curie temperature during use. These sections have a high power factor that approaches 1.0. The power factor for the entire temperature limited heater is maintained above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater even if some sections of the heater have power factors below 0.85.

Maintaining high power factors also allows for less expensive power supplies and or control devices such as solid state power supplies or SCRs silicon controlled rectifiers . These devices may fail to operate properly if the power factor varies by too large an amount because of inductive loads. With the power factors maintained at the higher values however these devices may be used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Solid state power supplies also have the advantage of allowing fine tuning and controlled adjustment of the power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments transformers are used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps may be made into the transformer to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps allows the current supplied to switch back and forth between the multiple voltages. This maintains the current within a range bound by the multiple voltage taps.

The highly electrically conductive member or inner conductor increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments thickness of the highly electrically conductive member is increased to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments the thickness of the electrical conductor is reduced to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater is between 1.1 and 10 between 2 and 8 or between 3 and 6 for example the turndown ratio is at least 1.1 at least 2 or at least 3 .

In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a corrosion resistant member. Electrical conductor support member may provide support for ferromagnetic conductor and corrosion resistance. Electrical conductor is made from a material that provides desired electrically resistive heat output at temperatures up to and or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor .

In an embodiment electrical conductor is 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor is another electrically conductive good mechanical strength corrosion resistant material. For example electrical conductor may be 304H 316H 347HH NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy Inco Alloys International Huntington W. Va. U.S.A. Haynes HR120 alloy or Inconel 617 alloy.

In some embodiments electrical conductor support member includes different alloys in different portions of the temperature limited heater. For example a lower portion of electrical conductor support member is 347H stainless steel and an upper portion of the electrical conductor support member is NF709. In certain embodiments different alloys are used in different portions of the electrical conductor support member to increase the mechanical strength of the electrical conductor support member while maintaining desired heating properties for the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductor includes different ferromagnetic conductors in different portions of the temperature limited heater. Different ferromagnetic conductors may be used in different portions of the temperature limited heater to vary the Curie temperature and thus the maximum operating temperature in the different portions. In some embodiments the Curie temperature in an upper portion of the temperature limited heater is lower than the Curie temperature in a lower portion of the heater. The lower Curie temperature in the upper portion increases the creep rupture strength lifetime in the upper portion of the heater.

In the embodiment depicted in ferromagnetic conductor electrical conductor and core are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the support member when the temperature is below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater depicted in is smaller for example an outside diameter of 3 cm 2.9 cm 2.5 cm or less than other temperature limited heaters that do not use electrical conductor to provide the majority of electrically resistive heat output. The temperature limited heater depicted in may be smaller because ferromagnetic conductor is thin as compared to the size of the ferromagnetic conductor needed for a temperature limited heater in which the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by the ferromagnetic conductor.

In some embodiments the support member and the corrosion resistant member are different members in the temperature limited heater. depict embodiments of temperature limited heaters in which the jacket provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In these embodiments electrical conductor is jacket . Electrical conductor ferromagnetic conductor support member and core in or inner conductor in are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the thickness of the jacket. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a material that is corrosion resistant and provides electrically resistive heat output below the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . For example electrical conductor is 825 stainless steel or 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor has a small thickness for example on the order of 0.5 mm .

In core is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. Support member is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor .

In support member is the core of the temperature limited heater and is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . Inner conductor is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.

In certain embodiments middle conductor in the temperature limited heater with triaxial conductors depicted in and includes an electrical conductor in addition to the ferromagnetic material. The electrical conductor may be on the outside of middle conductor . The electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic material are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor when the temperature is below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. The electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of middle conductor and the triaxial temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor is made from a material that provides desired electrically resistive heat output at temperatures up to and or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic member. For example the electrical conductor is 347H stainless steel 304H 316H 347HH NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy Haynes HR120 alloy or Inconel 617 alloy.

In certain embodiments the materials and design of the temperature limited heater are chosen to allow use of the heater at high temperatures for example above 850 C. . depicts a high temperature embodiment of the temperature limited heater. The heater depicted in operates as a conductor in conduit heater with the majority of heat being generated in conduit . The conductor in conduit heater may provide a higher heat output because the majority of heat is generated in conduit rather than conductor . Having the heat generated in conduit reduces heat losses associated with transferring heat between the conduit and conductor .

Core and conductive layer are copper. In some embodiments core and conductive layer are nickel if the operating temperatures is to be near or above the melting point of copper. Support members are electrically conductive materials with good mechanical strength at high temperatures. Materials for support members that withstand at least a maximum temperature of about 870 C. may be but are not limited to MO RE alloys Duraloy Technologies Inc. Scottdale Pa. U.S.A. CF8C Metaltek Intl. Waukesha Wis. U.S.A. or Inconel 617 alloy. Materials for support members that withstand at least a maximum temperature of about 980 C. include but are not limited to Incoloy Alloy MA 956. Support member in conduit provides mechanical support for the conduit. Support member in conductor provides mechanical support for core .

Electrical conductor is a thin corrosion resistant material. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is 347H 617 625 or 800H stainless steel. Ferromagnetic conductor is a high Curie temperature ferromagnetic material such as iron cobalt alloy for example a 15 by weight cobalt iron cobalt alloy .

In certain embodiments electrical conductor provides the majority of heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . Conductive layer increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.

For long vertical temperature limited heaters for example heaters at least 300 m at least 500 m or at least 1 km in length the hanging stress becomes important in the selection of materials for the temperature limited heater. Without the proper selection of material the support member may not have sufficient mechanical strength for example creep rupture strength to support the weight of the temperature limited heater at the operating temperatures of the heater. depicts hanging stress ksi kilopounds per square inch versus outside diameter in. for the temperature limited heater shown in with 347H as the support member. The hanging stress was assessed with the support member outside a 0.5 copper core and a 0.75 outside diameter carbon steel ferromagnetic conductor. This assessment assumes the support member bears the entire load of the heater and that the heater length is 1000 ft. about 305 m . As shown in increasing the thickness of the support member decreases the hanging stress on the support member. Decreasing the hanging stress on the support member allows the temperature limited heater to operate at higher temperatures.

In certain embodiments materials for the support member are varied to increase the maximum allowable hanging stress at operating temperatures of the temperature limited heater and thus increase the maximum operating temperature of the temperature limited heater. Altering the materials of the support member affects the heat output of the temperature limited heater below the Curie temperature because changing the materials changes the resistance versus temperature profile of the support member. In certain embodiments the support member is made of more than one material along the length of the heater so that the temperature limited heater maintains desired operating properties for example resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature as much as possible while providing sufficient mechanical properties to support the heater.

In some embodiments a transition section is used between sections of the heater. For example if one or more portions of the heater have varying Curie temperatures a transition section may be used between portions to provide strength that compensates for the differences in temperatures in the portions. depicts another example of an embodiment of a temperature limited heater able to provide desired heat output and mechanical strength. The support member in heater portion is 347H stainless steel. The support member in heater portion is NF709. The support member in heater portion is 347H. Portion has a length of 550 ft. and a Curie temperature of 843 C. portion has a length of 250 ft. and a Curie temperature of 843 C. and portion has a length of 180 ft. and a Curie temperature of 770 C. Transition section has a length of 20 ft. a Curie temperature of 770 C. and the support member is NF709.

The materials of the support member along the length of the temperature limited heater may be varied to achieve a variety of desired operating properties. The choice of the materials of the temperature limited heater is adjusted depending on a desired use of the temperature limited heater. TABLE 1 lists examples of materials that may be used for the support member. The table provides the hanging stresses of the support members and the maximum operating temperatures of the temperature limited heaters for several different outside diameters OD of the support member. The core diameter and the outside diameter of the iron ferromagnetic conductor in each case are 0.5 and 0.765 respectively.

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying outside diameters and or materials to provide desired properties for the heater. depict examples of embodiments for temperature limited heaters that vary the diameter and or materials of the support member along the length of the heaters to provide desired operating properties and sufficient mechanical properties for example creep rupture strength properties for operating temperatures up to about 834 C. for 30 000 hrs. heater lengths of 850 ft a copper core diameter of 0.5 and an iron cobalt 6 by weight cobalt ferromagnetic conductor outside diameter of 0.75 . In portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 300 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 400 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 150 ft and an outside diameter of 1.25 . In portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 300 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 100 ft and an outside diameter of 1.20 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 350 ft and an outside diameter of 1.20 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 100 ft and an outside diameter of 1.25 .

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying dimensions and or varying materials to provide different power outputs along the length of the heater. More or less power output may be provided by varying the selected temperature for example the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater by using different ferromagnetic materials along its length and or by varying the electrical resistance of the heater by using different dimensions in the heat generating member along the length of the heater. Different power outputs along the length of the temperature limited heater may be needed to compensate for different thermal properties in the formation adjacent to the heater. For example an oil shale formation may have different water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions at different depths in the formation. Portions of the formation with higher water filled porosities higher dawsonite compositions and or higher nahcolite compositions may need more power input than portions with lower water filled porosities lower dawsonite compositions and or lower nahcolite compositions to achieve a similar heating rate. Power output may be varied along the length of the heater so that the portions of the formation with different properties such as water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions are heated at approximately the same heating rate.

In certain embodiments portions of the temperature limited heater have different selected self limiting temperatures for example Curie temperatures materials and or dimensions to compensate for varying thermal properties of the formation along the length of the heater. For example Curie temperatures support member materials and or dimensions of the portions of the heaters depicted in may be varied to provide varying power outputs and or operating temperatures along the length of the heater.

As one example in an embodiment of the temperature limited heater depicted in portion may be used to heat portions of the formation that on average have higher water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions than portions of the formation heated by portion . Portion may provide less power output than portion to compensate for the differing thermal properties of the different portions of the formation so that the entire formation is heated at an approximately constant heating rate. Portion may require less power output because for example portion is used to heat portions of the formation with low water filled porosities and or little or no dawsonite. In one embodiment portion has a Curie temperature of 770 C. pure iron and portion has a Curie temperature of 843 C. iron with added cobalt . Such an embodiment may provide more power output from portion so that the temperature lag between the two portions is reduced. Adjusting the Curie temperature of portions of the heater adjusts the selected temperature at which the heater self limits. In some embodiments the dimensions of portion are adjusted to further reduce the temperature lag so that the formation is heated at an approximately constant heating rate throughout the formation. Dimensions of the heater may be adjusted to adjust the heating rate of one or more portions of the heater. For example the thickness of an outer conductor in portion may be increased relative to the ferromagnetic member and or the core of the heater so that the portion has a higher electrical resistance and the portion provides a higher power output below the Curie temperature of the portion.

Reducing the temperature lag between different portions of the formation may reduce the overall time needed to bring the formation to a desired temperature. Reducing the time needed to bring the formation to the desired temperature reduces heating costs and produces desirable production fluids more quickly.

Temperature limited heaters with varying Curie temperatures may also have varying support member materials to provide mechanical strength for the heater for example to compensate for hanging stress of the heater and or provide sufficient creep rupture strength properties . For example in the embodiment of the temperature limited heater depicted in portions and have a Curie temperature of 843 C. Portion has a support member made of 347H stainless steel. Portion has a support member made of NF709. Portion has a Curie temperature of 770 C. and a support member made of 347H stainless steel. Transition section has a Curie temperature of 770 C. and a support member made of NF709. Transition section may be short in length compared to portions and . Transition section may be placed between portions and to compensate for the temperature and material differences between the portions. For example transition section may be used to compensate for differences in creep properties between portions and .

Such a substantially vertical temperature limited heater may have less expensive lower strength materials in portion because of the lower Curie temperature in this portion of the heater. For example 347H stainless steel may be used for the support member because of the lower maximum operating temperature of portion as compared to portion . Portion may require the more expensive higher strength material because of the higher operating temperature of portion due to the higher Curie temperature in this portion.

In some embodiments a relatively thin conductive layer is used to provide the majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Such a temperature limited heater may be used as the heating member in an insulated conductor heater. The heating member of the insulated conductor heater may be located inside a sheath with an insulation layer between the sheath and the heating member.

Inner conductor is a relatively thin conductive layer of non ferromagnetic material with a higher electrical conductivity than ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments inner conductor is copper. Inner conductor may also be a copper alloy. Copper alloys typically have a flatter resistance versus temperature profile than pure copper. A flatter resistance versus temperature profile may provide less variation in the heat output as a function of temperature up to the Curie temperature. In some embodiments inner conductor is copper with 6 by weight nickel for example CuNi6 or LOHM . In some embodiments inner conductor is CuNi10Fe1Mn alloy. Below the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to inner conductor . Thus inner conductor provides the majority of the resistive heat output of insulated conductor below the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments inner conductor is dimensioned along with core and ferromagnetic conductor so that the inner conductor provides a desired amount of heat output and a desired turndown ratio. For example inner conductor may have a cross sectional area that is around 2 or 3 times less than the cross sectional area of core . Typically inner conductor has to have a relatively small cross sectional area to provide a desired heat output if the inner conductor is copper or copper alloy. In an embodiment with copper inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.03 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.53 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.79 cm. In an embodiment with a CuNi6 inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.12 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.63 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.88 cm. Such insulated conductors are typically smaller and cheaper to manufacture than insulated conductors that do not use the thin inner conductor to provide the majority of heat output below the Curie temperature.

Electrical insulator may be magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments electrical insulator is a compacted powder of magnesium oxide. In some embodiments electrical insulator includes beads of silicon nitride.

In certain embodiments a small layer of material is placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor to inhibit copper from migrating into the electrical insulator at higher temperatures. For example the small layer of nickel for example about 0.5 mm of nickel may be placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor .

Jacket is made of a corrosion resistant material such as but not limited to 347 stainless steel 347H stainless steel 446 stainless steel or 825 stainless steel. In some embodiments jacket provides some mechanical strength for insulated conductor at or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments jacket is not used to conduct electrical current.

In certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters three temperature limited heaters are coupled together in a three phase wye configuration. Coupling three temperature limited heaters together in the three phase wye configuration lowers the current in each of the individual temperature limited heaters because the current is split between the three individual heaters. Lowering the current in each individual temperature limited heater allows each heater to have a small diameter. The lower currents allow for higher relative magnetic permeabilities in each of the individual temperature limited heaters and thus higher turndown ratios. In addition there may be no return current needed for each of the individual temperature limited heaters. Thus the turndown ratio remains higher for each of the individual temperature limited heaters than if each temperature limited heater had its own return current path.

In the three phase wye configuration individual temperature limited heaters may be coupled together by shorting the sheaths jackets or canisters of each of the individual temperature limited heaters to the electrically conductive sections the conductors providing heat at their terminating ends for example the ends of the heaters at the bottom of a heater wellbore . In some embodiments the sheaths jackets canisters and or electrically conductive sections are coupled to a support member that supports the temperature limited heaters in the wellbore.

In insulated conductors are coiled on coiled tubing rigs . As insulated conductors are uncoiled from rigs the insulated conductors are coupled to support member . In certain embodiments insulated conductors are simultaneously uncoiled and or simultaneously coupled to support member . Insulated conductors may be coupled to support member using metal for example 304 stainless steel or Inconel alloys straps . In some embodiments insulated conductors are coupled to support member using other types of fasteners such as buckles wire holders or snaps. Support member along with insulated conductors are installed into opening . In some embodiments insulated conductors are coupled together without the use of a support member. For example one or more straps may be used to couple insulated conductors together.

Insulated conductors may be electrically coupled to each other for example for a three phase wye configuration at a lower end of the insulated conductors. In a three phase wye configuration insulated conductors operate without a current return path. In certain embodiments insulated conductors are electrically coupled to each other in contactor section . In section sheaths jackets canisters and or electrically conductive sections are electrically coupled to each other and or to support member so that insulated conductors are electrically coupled in the section.

In certain embodiments the sheaths of insulated conductors are shorted to the conductors of the insulated conductors. depicts an embodiment of insulated conductor with the sheath shorted to the conductors. Sheath is electrically coupled to core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor using termination . Termination may be a metal strip or a metal plate at the lower end of insulated conductor . For example termination may be a copper plate coupled to sheath core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor so that they are shorted together. In some embodiments termination is welded or brazed to sheath core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor .

The sheaths of individual insulated conductors may be shorted together to electrically couple the conductors of the insulated conductors depicted in . In some embodiments the sheaths may be shorted together because the sheaths are in physical contact with each other. For example the sheaths may in physical contact if the sheaths are strapped together by straps . In some embodiments the lower ends of the sheaths are physically coupled for example welded at the surface of opening before insulated conductors are installed into the opening.

In certain embodiments three conductors are located inside a single conduit to form a three conductor in conduit heater. depict an embodiment of a three conductor in conduit heater. depicts a top down view of the three conductor in conduit heater. depicts a side view representation with a cutout to show the internals of the three conductor in conduit heater. Three conductors are located inside conduit . The three conductors are substantially evenly spaced within conduit . In some embodiments the three conductors are coupled in a spiral configuration.

One or more centralizers are placed around each conductor . Centralizers are made from electrically insulating material such as silicon nitride or boron nitride. Centralizers maintain a position of conductors in conduit . Centralizers also inhibit electrical contact between conductors and conduit . In certain embodiments centralizers are spaced along the length of conductors so that the centralizers surrounding one conductor overlap as seen from the top down view centralizers from another conductor. This reduces the number of centralizers needed for each conductor and allows for tight spacing of the conductors.

In certain embodiments the three conductors are coupled in a three phase wye configuration. The three conductors may be coupled at or near the bottom of the heaters in the three phase wye configuration. In the three phase wye configuration conduit is not electrically coupled to the three conductors . Thus conduit may only be used to provide strength for and or inhibit corrosion of the three conductors .

In some embodiments a long temperature limited heater for example a temperature limited heater in which the support member provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor is formed from several sections of heater. The sections of heater may be coupled using a welding process. depicts an embodiment for coupling together sections of a long temperature limited heater. Ends of ferromagnetic conductors and ends of electrical conductors support members are beveled to facilitate coupling the sections of the heater. Core has recesses to allow core coupling material to be placed inside the abutted ends of the heater. Core coupling material may be a pin or dowel that fits tightly in the recesses of cores . Core coupling material may be made out of the same material as cores or a material suitable for coupling the cores together. Core coupling material allows the heaters to be coupled together without welding cores together. Cores are coupled together as a pin or box joint.

Beveled ends of ferromagnetic conductors and electrical conductors may be coupled together with coupling material . In certain embodiments ends of ferromagnetic conductors and electrical conductors are welded for example orbital welded together. Coupling material may be stainless steel or any other suitable non ferromagnetic material for welding together ferromagnetic conductors and or electrical conductors . Using beveled ends when coupling together sections of the heater may produce a reliable and durable coupling between the sections of the heater.

During heating with the temperature limited heater core coupling material may expand more radially than ferromagnetic conductors electrical conductors and or coupling material . The greater expansion of core coupling material maintains good electrical contact with the core coupling material. At the coupling junction of the heater electricity flows through core coupling material rather than coupling material . This flow of electricity inhibits heat generation at the coupling junction so that the junction remains at lower temperatures than other portions of the heater during application of electrical current to the heater. The corrosion resistance and strength of the coupling junction is increased by maintaining the junction at lower temperatures.

In certain embodiments the junction may be enclosed in a shield during orbital welding to ensure reliability of the weld. If the junction is not enclosed disturbance of the inert gas caused by wind humidity or other conditions may cause oxidation and or porosity of the weld. Without a shield a first portion of the weld was formed and allowed to cool. A grinder would be used to remove the oxide layer. The process would be repeated until the weld was complete. Enclosing the junction in the shield with an inert gas allows the weld to be formed with no oxidation thus allowing the weld to be formed in one pass with no need for grinding. Enclosing the junction increases the safety of forming the weld because the arc of the orbital welder is enclosed in the shield during welding. Enclosing the junction in the shield may reduce the time needed to form the weld. Without a shield producing each weld may take 30 minutes or more. With the shield each weld may take 10 minutes or less.

Hinged door may be closed. The orbital welder may be used to weld the lower conductor to the upper conductor. Progress of the welding operation may be monitored through viewing windows . When the weld is complete shield may be supported and first clamp member may be unfastened from second clamp member . One or both inserts may be removed or partially removed from lower plate and upper plate to facilitate lowering of the conductor. The conductor may be lowered in the wellbore until the end of the conductor is located at a desired position in shield . Shield may be secured to the conductor with first clamp member and second clamp member . Another conductor may be positioned in the shield. Inserts may be positioned in upper and lower plates hinged door is closed and the orbital welder is used to weld the conductors together. The process may be repeated until a desired length of conductor is formed.

The shield may be used to weld joints of pipe over an opening in the hydrocarbon containing formation. Hydrocarbon vapors from the formation may create an explosive atmosphere in the shield even though the inert gas supplied to the shield inhibits the formation of dangerous concentrations of hydrocarbons in the shield. A control circuit may be coupled to a power supply for the orbital welder to stop power to the orbital welder to shut off the arc forming the weld if the hydrocarbon level in the shield rises above a selected concentration. depicts a schematic representation of a shut off circuit for orbital welding machine . An inert gas such as argon may enter shield through inlet . Gas may exit shield through purge . Power supply supplies electricity to orbital welding machine through lines . Switch may be located in line to orbital welding machine . Switch may be electrically coupled to hydrocarbon monitor . Hydrocarbon monitor may detect the hydrocarbon concentration in shield . If the hydrocarbon concentration in shield becomes too high for example over 25 of a lower explosion limit concentration hydrocarbon monitor may open switch . When switch is open power to orbital welder is interrupted and the arc formed by the orbital welder ends.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is used to achieve lower temperature heating for example for heating fluids in a production well heating a surface pipeline or reducing the viscosity of fluids in a wellbore or near wellbore region . Varying the ferromagnetic materials of the temperature limited heater allows for lower temperature heating. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor is made of material with a lower Curie temperature than that of 446 stainless steel. For example the ferromagnetic conductor may be an alloy of iron and nickel. The alloy may have between 30 by weight and 42 by weight nickel with the rest being iron. In one embodiment the alloy is Invar 36. Invar 36 is 36 by weight nickel in iron and has a Curie temperature of 277 C. In some embodiments an alloy is a three component alloy with for example chromium nickel and iron. For example an alloy may have 6 by weight chromium 42 by weight nickel and 52 by weight iron. A 2.5 cm diameter rod of Invar 36 has a turndown ratio of approximately 2 to 1 at the Curie temperature. Placing the Invar 36 alloy over a copper core may allow for a smaller rod diameter. A copper core may result in a high turndown ratio. The insulator in lower temperature heater embodiments may be made of a high performance polymer insulator such as PFA or PEEK when used with alloys with a Curie temperature that is below the melting point or softening point of the polymer insulator.

In certain embodiments a conductor in conduit temperature limited heater is used in lower temperature applications by using lower Curie temperature ferromagnetic materials. For example a lower Curie temperature ferromagnetic material may be used for heating inside sucker pump rods. Heating sucker pump rods may be useful to lower the viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump or rod and or to maintain a lower viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump rod. Lowering the viscosity of the oil may inhibit sticking of a pump used to pump the fluids. Fluids in the sucker pump rod may be heated up to temperatures less than about 250 C. or less than about 300 C. Temperatures need to be maintained below these values to inhibit coking of hydrocarbon fluids in the sucker pump system.

For lower temperature applications ferromagnetic conductor in may be Alloy 42 6 coupled to conductor . Conductor may be copper. In one embodiment ferromagnetic conductor is 1.9 cm outside diameter Alloy 42 6 over copper conductor with a 2 1 outside diameter to copper diameter ratio. In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductor includes other lower temperature ferromagnetic materials such as Alloy 32 Alloy 52 Invar 36 iron nickel chromium alloys iron nickel alloys nickel chromium alloys or other nickel alloys. Conduit may be a hollow sucker rod made from carbon steel. The carbon steel or other material used in conduit confines current to the inside of the conduit to inhibit stray voltages at the surface of the formation. Centralizer may be made from gas pressure sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride. In some embodiments centralizer is made from polymers such as PFA or PEEK . In certain embodiments polymer insulation is clad along an entire length of the heater. Conductor and ferromagnetic conductor are electrically coupled to conduit with sliding connector .

Conductive section electrically couples inner conductor to outer conductor and or jacket . In some embodiments jacket touches or electrically contacts conductive layer for example if the heater is placed in a horizontal configuration . If jacket is a ferromagnetic metal such as carbon steel with a Curie temperature above the Curie temperature of outer conductor current will propagate only on the inside of the jacket. Thus the outside of the jacket remains electrically uncharged during operation. In some embodiments jacket is drawn down for example swaged down in a die onto conductive layer so that a tight fit is made between the jacket and the conductive layer. The heater may be spooled as coiled tubing for insertion into a wellbore. In other embodiments an annular space is present between conductive layer and jacket as depicted in .

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater includes a flexible cable for example a furnace cable as the inner conductor. For example the inner conductor may be a 27 nickel clad or stainless steel clad stranded copper wire with four layers of mica tape surrounded by a layer of ceramic and or mineral fiber for example alumina fiber aluminosilicate fiber borosilicate fiber or aluminoborosilicate fiber . A stainless steel clad stranded copper wire furnace cable may be available from Anomet Products Inc. The inner conductor may be rated for applications at temperatures of 1000 C. or higher. The inner conductor may be pulled inside a conduit. The conduit may be a ferromagnetic conduit for example a Schedule 80 446 stainless steel pipe . The conduit may be covered with a layer of copper or other electrical conductor with a thickness of about 0.3 cm or any other suitable thickness. The assembly may be placed inside a support conduit for example a 1 Schedule 80 347H or 347HH stainless steel tubular . The support conduit may provide additional creep rupture strength and protection for the copper and the inner conductor. For uses at temperatures greater than about 1000 C. the inner copper conductor may be plated with a more corrosion resistant alloy for example Incoloy 825 to inhibit oxidation. In some embodiments the top of the temperature limited heater is sealed to inhibit air from contacting the inner conductor.

In some embodiments a ferromagnetic conductor of a temperature limited heater includes a copper core for example a 1.27 cm diameter copper core placed inside a first steel conduit for example a Schedule 80 347H or 347HH stainless steel pipe . A second steel conduit for example a 1 Schedule 80 446 stainless steel pipe may be drawn down over the first steel conduit assembly. The first steel conduit may provide strength and creep resistance while the copper core may provide a high turndown ratio.

In some embodiments a ferromagnetic conductor of a temperature limited heater for example a center or inner conductor of a conductor in conduit temperature limited heater includes a heavy walled conduit for example an extra heavy wall 410 stainless steel pipe . The heavy walled conduit may have a diameter of about 2.5 cm. The heavy walled conduit may be drawn down over a copper rod. The copper rod may have a diameter of about 1.3 cm. The resulting heater may include a thick ferromagnetic sheath containing the copper rod. The thick ferromagnetic sheath may be the heavy walled conduit with for example about a 2.6 cm outside diameter after drawing. The heater may have a turndown ratio of about 8 1. The thickness of the heavy walled conduit may be selected to inhibit deformation of the heater. A thick ferromagnetic conduit may provide deformation resistance while adding minimal expense to the cost of the heater.

In another embodiment a temperature limited heater includes a substantially U shaped heater with a ferromagnetic cladding over a non ferromagnetic core in this context the U may have a curved or alternatively orthogonal shape . A U shaped or hairpin heater may have insulating support mechanisms for example polymer or ceramic spacers that inhibit the two legs of the hairpin from electrically shorting to each other. In some embodiments a hairpin heater is installed in a casing for example an environmental protection casing . The insulators may inhibit electrical shorting to the casing and may facilitate installation of the heater in the casing. The cross section of the hairpin heater may be but is not limited to circular elliptical square or rectangular.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater incorporates curves helixes bends or waves in a relatively straight heater to allow thermal expansion and contraction of the heater without overstressing materials in the heater. When a cool heater is heated or a hot heater is cooled the heater expands or contracts in proportion to the change in temperature and the coefficient of thermal expansion of materials in the heater. For long straight heaters that undergo wide variations in temperature during use and are fixed at more than one point in the wellbore for example due to mechanical deformation of the wellbore the expansion or contraction may cause the heater to bend kink and or pull apart. Use of an S bend or other curves helixes bends or waves in the heater at intervals in the heated length may provide a spring effect and allow the heater to expand or contract more gently so that the heater does not bend kink or pull apart.

A 310 stainless steel heater subjected to about 500 C. temperature change may shrink grow approximately 0.85 of the length of the heater with this temperature change. Thus a length of about 3 m of a heater would contract about 2.6 cm when it cools through 500 C. If a long heater were affixed at about 3 m intervals such a change in length could stretch and possibly break the heater. depicts an embodiment of an S bend in a heater. The additional material in the S bend may allow for thermal contraction or expansion of heater without damage to the heater.

The sandwich heater may be inserted in a casing such as an environmental protection casing. The sandwich heater may be separated from the casing with an electrical insulator.

A heater may include a section that passes through an overburden. In some embodiments the portion of the heater in the overburden does not need to supply as much heat as a portion of the heater adjacent to hydrocarbon layers that are to be subjected to in situ conversion. In certain embodiments a substantially non heating section of a heater has limited or no heat output. A substantially non heating section of a heater may be located adjacent to layers of the formation for example rock layers non hydrocarbon layers or lean layers that remain advantageously unheated. A substantially non heating section of a heater may include a copper or aluminum conductor instead of a ferromagnetic conductor. In some embodiments a substantially non heating section of a heater includes a copper or copper alloy inner conductor. A substantially non heating section may also include a copper outer conductor clad with a corrosion resistant alloy. In some embodiments an overburden section includes a relatively thick ferromagnetic portion to inhibit crushing.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater provides some heat to the overburden portion of a heater well and or production well. Heat supplied to the overburden portion may inhibit formation fluids for example water and hydrocarbons from refluxing or condensing in the wellbore. Refluxing fluids may use a large portion of heat energy supplied to a target section of the wellbore thus limiting heat transfer from the wellbore to the target section.

A temperature limited heater may be constructed in sections that are coupled welded . The sections may be 10 m long or longer. Construction materials for each section are chosen to provide a selected heat output for different parts of the formation. For example an oil shale formation may contain layers with highly variable richnesses. Providing selected amounts of heat to individual layers or multiple layers with similar richnesses improves heating efficiency of the formation and or inhibits collapse of the wellbore. A splice section may be formed between the sections for example by welding the inner conductors filling the splice section with an insulator and then welding the outer conductor. Alternatively the heater is formed from larger diameter tubulars and drawn down to a desired length and diameter. A boron nitride silicon nitride magnesium oxide or other type of insulation layer may be added by a weld fill draw method starting from metal strip or a fill draw method starting from tubulars well known in the industry in the manufacture of mineral insulated heater cables. The assembly and filling can be done in a vertical or a horizontal orientation. The final heater assembly may be spooled onto a large diameter spool for example 1 m 2 m 3 m or more in diameter and transported to a site of the formation for subsurface deployment. Alternatively the heater may be assembled on site in sections as the heater is lowered vertically into a wellbore.

The temperature limited heater may be a single phase heater or a three phase heater. In a three phase heater embodiment the temperature limited heater has a delta or a wye configuration. Each of the three ferromagnetic conductors in the three phase heater may be inside a separate sheath. A connection between conductors may be made at the bottom of the heater inside a splice section. The three conductors may remain insulated from the sheath inside the splice section.

In an embodiment the heated section of a three phase heater is about 245 m long. The three phase heater may be wye connected and operated at a current of about 150 A. The resistance of one leg of the heater may increase from about 1.1 ohms at room temperature to about 3.1 ohms at about 650 C. The resistance of one leg may decrease rapidly above about 720 C. to about 1.5 ohms. The voltage may increase from about 165 V at room temperature to about 465 V at 650 C. The voltage may decrease rapidly above about 720 C. to about 225 V. The heat output per leg may increase from about 102 watts meter at room temperature to about 285 watts meter at 650 C. The heat output per leg may decrease rapidly above about 720 C. to about 1.4 watts meter. Other embodiments of inner conductor core jacket and or electrical insulator may be used in the three phase temperature limited heater shown in .

In another embodiment a single outer sheath or three outer sheaths are ferromagnetic conductors and the inner conductors may be non ferromagnetic for example aluminum copper or a highly conductive alloy . Alternatively each of the three non ferromagnetic conductors are inside a separate ferromagnetic sheath and a connection between the conductors is made at the bottom of the heater inside a splice section. The three conductors may remain insulated from the sheath inside the splice section.

In some embodiments the three phase heater includes three legs that are located in separate wellbores. The legs may be coupled in a common contacting section for example a central wellbore a connecting wellbore or a solution filled contacting section . depicts an embodiment of temperature limited heaters coupled in a three phase configuration. Each leg may be located in separate openings in hydrocarbon layer . Each leg may include heating element . Each leg may be coupled to single contacting element in one opening . Contacting element may electrically couple legs together in a three phase configuration. Contacting element may be located in for example a central opening in the formation. Contacting element may be located in a portion of opening below hydrocarbon layer for example in the underburden . In certain embodiments magnetic tracking of a magnetic element located in a central opening for example opening with leg is used to guide the formation of the outer openings for example openings with legs and so that the outer openings intersect the central opening. The central opening may be formed first using standard wellbore drilling methods. Contacting element may include funnels guides or catchers for allowing each leg to be inserted into the contacting element.

In certain embodiments two legs in separate wellbores intercept in a single contacting section. depicts an embodiment of two temperature limited heaters coupled in a single contacting section. Legs and include one or more heating elements . Heating elements may include one or more electrical conductors. In certain embodiments legs and are electrically coupled in a single phase configuration with one leg positively biased versus the other leg so that current flows downhole through one leg and returns through the other leg.

Heating elements in legs and may be temperature limited heaters. In certain embodiments heating elements are solid rod heaters. For example heating elements may be rods made of a single ferromagnetic conductor element or composite conductors that include ferromagnetic material. During initial heating when water is present in the formation being heated heating elements may leak current into hydrocarbon layer . The current leaked into hydrocarbon layer may resistively heat the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments for example in oil shale formations heating elements do not need support members. Heating elements may be partially or slightly bent curved made into an S shape or made into a helical shape to allow for expansion and or contraction of the heating elements. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements are placed in small diameter wellbores for example about 3 about 9.5 cm diameter wellbores . Small diameter wellbores may be less expensive to drill or form than larger diameter wellbores and there will be less cuttings to dispose of.

In certain embodiments portions of legs and in overburden have insulation for example polymer insulation to inhibit heating the overburden. Heating elements may be substantially vertical and substantially parallel to each other in hydrocarbon layer . At or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer leg may be directionally drilled towards leg to intercept leg in contacting section . Directional drilling may be done by for example Vector Magnetics LLC Ithaca N.Y. U.S.A. . The depth of contacting section depends on the length of bend in leg needed to intercept leg . For example for a 40 ft about 12 m spacing between vertical portions of legs and about 200 ft about 61 m is needed to allow the bend of leg to intercept leg .

In some embodiments electrical contact is made between contacting elements using only contact solution . depicts an embodiment for coupling legs and in contacting section without contactor .

In certain embodiments contacting elements include one or more fins or projections. The fins or projections may increase an electrical contact area of contacting elements . In some embodiments legs and for example electrical conductors in heating elements are electrically coupled but do not physically contact each other. This type of electrical coupling may be accomplished with for example contact solution .

In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed to hydrocarbon layer and fluids from the hydrocarbon layer. Thus heating elements are bare metal or exposed metal heating elements. Heating elements may be made from a material that has an acceptable sulfidation rate at high temperatures used for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature over at least a certain temperature range for example 530 C. to 650 C. such as 410 stainless steel. Using such materials reduces corrosion problems due to sulfur containing gases such as HS from the formation. Heating elements may also be substantially inert to galvanic corrosion.

In some embodiments heating elements have a thin electrically insulating layer such as aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is a ceramic composition such as an enamel coating. Enamel coatings include but are not limited to high temperature porcelain enamels. High temperature porcelain enamels may include silicon dioxide boron oxide alumina and alkaline earth oxides CaO or MgO and minor amounts of alkali oxides NaO KO LiO . The enamel coating may be applied as a finely ground slurry by dipping the heating element into the slurry or spray coating the heating element with the slurry. The coated heating element is then heated in a furnace until the glass transition temperature is reached so that the slurry spreads over the surface of the heating element and makes the porcelain enamel coating. The porcelain enamel coating contracts when cooled below the glass transition temperature so that the coating is in compression. Thus when the coating is heated during operation of the heater the coating is able to expand with the heater without cracking.

The thin electrically insulating layer has low thermal impedance allowing heat transfer from the heating element to the formation while inhibiting current leakage between heating elements in adjacent openings and or current leakage into the formation. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is stable at temperatures above at least 350 C. above 500 C. or above 800 C. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer has an emissivity of at least 0.7 at least 0.8 or at least 0.9. Using the thin electrically insulating layer may allow for long heater lengths in the formation with low current leakage.

Heating elements may be coupled to contacting elements at or near the underburden of the formation. Contacting elements are copper or aluminum rods or other highly conductive materials. In certain embodiments transition sections are located between lead in conductors and heating elements and or between heating elements and contacting elements . Transition sections may be made of a conductive material that is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over a copper core. In certain embodiments transition sections are made of materials that electrically couple lead in conductors and heating elements while providing little or no heat output. Thus transition sections help to inhibit overheating of conductors and insulation used in lead in conductors by spacing the lead in conductors from heating elements . Transition section may have a length of between about 3 m and about 9 m for example about 6 m .

Contacting elements are coupled to contactor in contacting section to electrically couple legs to each other.

The other two legs are directed for example by directionally drilling the wellbores for the legs to intercept leg in contacting section .

Each leg may be one leg of a three phase heater embodiment so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation. Legs may be arranged in a triangular pattern so that the three legs form a triangular shaped three phase heater. In an embodiment legs are arranged in a triangular pattern with 12 m spacing between the legs each side of the triangle has a length of 12 m .

In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer allows for relatively long substantially horizontal heater leg lengths in the hydrocarbon layer with a substantially u shaped heater. depicts a side view representation of an embodiment of a substantially u shaped three phase heater. First ends of legs are coupled to transformer at first location . In an embodiment transformer is a three phase AC transformer. Ends of legs are electrically coupled together with connector at second location . Connector electrically couples the ends of legs so that the legs can be operated in a three phase configuration. In certain embodiments legs are coupled to operate in a three phase wye configuration. In certain embodiments legs are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments legs are arranged in a triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heating elements include a thin electrically insulating material such as a porcelain enamel coating to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In certain embodiments legs are electrically coupled so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation.

In certain embodiments overburden casings for example overburden casings depicted in in overburden include materials that inhibit ferromagnetic effects in the casings. Inhibiting ferromagnetic effects in casings reduces heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated polyvinylchloride CPVC or high density polyethylene HDPE . HDPEs with working temperatures in a range for use in overburden include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. .

In some embodiments casings include carbon steel coupled on the inside diameter of a non ferromagnetic metal for example carbon steel clad with copper or aluminum to inhibit ferromagnetic effects or inductive effects in the carbon steel. Other non ferromagnetic metals include but are not limited to manganese steels with at least 10 by weight manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 by weight aluminum and austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel.

In certain embodiments one or more non ferromagnetic materials used in casings are used in a wellhead coupled to the casings and legs . Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead inhibits undesirable heating of components in the wellhead. In some embodiments a purge gas for example carbon dioxide nitrogen or argon is introduced into the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In certain embodiments one or more of legs are installed in the formation using coiled tubing. In certain embodiments coiled tubing is installed in the formation the leg is installed inside the coiled tubing and the coiled tubing is pulled out of the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The leg may be placed concentrically inside the coiled tubing. In some embodiments coiled tubing with the leg inside the coiled tubing is installed in the formation and the coiled tubing is removed from the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The coiled tubing may extend only to a junction of hydrocarbon layer and contacting section or to a point at which the leg begins to bend in the contacting section.

The phases of each triad may be arranged so that legs A B C correspond between triads as shown in . In legs A B C are arranged such that a phase leg for example leg A in a given triad is about two triad heights from a same phase leg leg A in an adjacent triad. The triad height is the distance from a vertex of the triad to a midpoint of the line intersecting the other two vertices of the triad. In certain embodiments the phases of triads are arranged to inhibit net current flow between individual triads. There may be some leakage of current within an individual triad but little net current flows between two triads due to the substantial electrical isolation of the triads and in certain embodiments the arrangement of the triad phases.

In the early stages of heating an exposed heating element for example heating element depicted in may leak some current to water or other fluids that are electrically conductive in the formation so that the formation itself is heated. After water or other electrically conductive fluids are removed from the wellbore for example vaporized or produced the heating elements become electrically isolated from the formation. Later when water is removed from the formation the formation becomes even more electrically resistant and heating of the formation occurs even more predominantly via thermally conductive and or radiative heating. Typically the formation the hydrocarbon layer has an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m.

Using the temperature limited heaters as the heating elements limits the effect of water saturation on heater efficiency. With water in the formation and in heater wellbores there is a tendency for electrical current to flow between heater elements at the top of the hydrocarbon layer where the voltage is highest and cause uneven heating in the hydrocarbon layer. This effect is inhibited with temperature limited heaters because the temperature limited heaters reduce localized overheating in the heating elements and in the hydrocarbon layer.

In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential. This location minimizes stray potentials at the production well. Placing production wells at such locations improves the safety of the system and reduces or inhibits undesired heating of the production wells caused by electrical current flow in the production wells. depicts a top view representation of the embodiment depicted in with production wells . In certain embodiments production wells are located at or near center of triad . In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location between triads at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential at a location at which voltage potentials from vertices of three triads average out to relatively little or zero voltage potential . For example production well may be at a location equidistant from legs A of one triad leg B of a second triad and leg C of a third triad as shown in .

Production well may be placed at or near the center of hexagon . Placing production well at or near the center of hexagon places the production well at a location that reduces or inhibits undesired heating due to electromagnetic effects caused by electrical current flow in the legs of the triads and increases the safety of the system. Having two triads in hexagon provides for redundant heating around production well . Thus if one triad fails or has to be turned off production well still remains at a center of one triad.

As shown in hexagons may be arranged in a pattern in the formation such that adjacent hexagons are offset. Using electrically isolated transformers on adjacent hexagons may inhibit electrical potentials in the formation so that little or no net current leaks between hexagons.

Contactor may be a casing or a solid rod placed in a wellbore drilled substantially horizontally in contacting section . Legs A A A and legs B B B may be electrically coupled to contactor by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to contactor for example by welding or brazing the containers to the contactor legs A A A and legs B B B are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the legs to the contactor. The containers may be coupled to contactor by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in contactor or coupled to the outside of the contactor and then brazing or welding the containers to the contactor.

In an embodiment the coupling material electrically couples contacting elements in container . In some embodiments the coupling material metallically bonds to contacting elements so that the contacting elements are metallically bonded to each other. In some embodiments container is initially filled with a high viscosity water based polymer fluid to inhibit drill cuttings or other materials from entering the container prior to using the coupling material to couple the contacting elements.

Such low temperature solders will displace water upon melting so that the water moves to the top of container . Water at the top of container may inhibit heat transfer into the container and thermally insulate the low temperature solder so that the solder remains at cooler temperatures and does not melt during heating of the formation using the heating elements.

In certain embodiments container is made of or includes copper for good electrical and thermal conductivity. A copper container makes good electrical contact with contacting elements such as contacting elements shown in if the contacting elements touch the walls and or bottom of the container.

Lower portions of contacting elements inside container may include 410 stainless steel or any other heat generating electrical conductor. Portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements include copper or another highly electrically conductive material. Centralizers may be located on the portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements. Centralizers inhibit physical and electrical contact of portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements against walls of container .

When contacting elements are locked into place inside container by protrusions at least some electrical current may be pass between the contacting elements through the protrusions. As electrical current is passed through the heat generating portions of contacting elements heat is generated in container . The generated heat may melt coupling material located inside container . Water in container may boil. The boiling water may convect heat to upper portions of container and aid in melting of coupling material . Walls of container may be thermally insulated to reduce heat losses out of the container and allow the inside of the container to heat up faster. Coupling material flows down into the lower portion of container as the coupling material melts. Coupling material fills the lower portion of container until the heat generating portions of contacting elements are below the fill line of the coupling material. Coupling material then electrically couples the portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements. The resistance of contacting elements decreases at this point and heat is no longer generated in the contacting elements and the coupling materials is allowed to cool.

The exposed portions allow for better electrical contact between contacting elements and coupling material after the coupling material has been melted fills container and is allowed to cool.

In certain embodiments heating elements operate as temperature limited heaters when a time varying current is applied to the heating elements. For example a 400 Hz AC current may be applied to heating elements . Application of the time varying current to contacting elements causes heating elements to generate heat and melt coupling material . Heating elements may operate as temperature limited heating elements with a self limiting temperature selected so that coupling material is not overheated. As coupling material fills container the coupling material makes electrical contact between portions of exposed material on contacting elements and electrical current begins to flow through the exposed material portions rather than heating elements . Thus the electrical resistance between the contacting elements decreases. As this occurs temperatures inside container begin to decrease and coupling material is allowed to cool to create an electrical contacting section between contacting elements . In certain embodiments electrical power to contacting elements and heating elements is turned off when the electrical resistance in the system falls below a selected resistance. The selected resistance may indicate that the coupling material has sufficiently electrically connected the contacting elements. In some embodiments electrical power is supplied to contacting elements and heating elements for a selected amount of time that is determined to provide enough heat to melt the mass of coupling material provided in container .

Time varying electrical current may be applied to contacting elements so that heating elements generate heat.

Explosive elements are arranged in this configuration so that energy from the explosion of the explosive elements causes contacting elements to be pushed towards the center of inner container .

Explosive elements may be coupled to battery and timer . Battery may provide power to explosive elements to initiate the explosion. Timer may be used to control the time for igniting explosive elements . Battery and timer may be coupled to triggers . Triggers may be located in openings . Contacting elements may set off triggers as the contacting elements are placed into openings . When both triggers in openings are triggered timer may initiate a countdown before igniting explosive elements . Thus explosive elements are controlled to explode only after contacting elements are placed sufficiently into openings so that electrical contact may be made between the contacting elements and inner container after the explosions. Explosion of explosive elements crimps contacting elements and inner container together to make electrical contact between the contacting elements and the inner container. In certain embodiments explosive elements fire from the bottom towards the top of inner container . Explosive elements may be designed with a length and explosive power band width that gives an optimum electrical contact between contacting elements and inner container .

In some embodiments triggers battery and timer may be used to ignite a powder for example copper thermite powder inside a container for example container or inner container . Battery may charge a magnesium ribbon or other ignition device in the powder to initiate reaction of the powder to produce a molten metal product. The molten metal product may flow and then cool to electrically contact the contacting elements.

In certain embodiments electrical connection is made between contacting elements through mechanical means. depicts an embodiment of contacting element with a brush contactor. Brush contactor is coupled to a lower portion of contacting element . Brush contactor may be made of a malleable electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. Brush contactor may be a webbing of material that is compressible and or flexible. Centralizer may be located at or near the bottom of contacting element .

In certain embodiments contacting elements depicted in are coupled in a zone of the formation that is cooler than the layer of the formation to be heated for example in the underburden of the formation . Contacting elements are coupled in a cooler zone to inhibit melting of the coupling material and or degradation of the electrical connection between the elements during heating of the hydrocarbon layer above the cooler zone. In certain embodiments contacting elements are coupled in a zone that is at least about 3 m at least about 6 m or at least about 9 m below the layer of the formation to be heated. In some embodiments the zone has a standing water level that is above a depth of containers .

In certain embodiments exposed metal heating elements are used in substantially horizontal sections of u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may be used in tar sands formations oil shale formation or other formations with relatively thin hydrocarbon layers. Tar sands or thin oil shale formations may have thin shallow layers that are more easily and uniformly heated using heaters placed in substantially u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also be used to process formations with thick hydrocarbon layers in formations. In some embodiments substantially u shaped wellbores are used to access rich layers in a thick hydrocarbon formation.

Heaters in substantially u shaped wellbores may have long lengths compared to heaters in vertical wellbores because horizontal heating sections do not have problems with creep or hanging stress encountered with vertical heating elements. Substantially u shaped wellbores may make use of natural seals in the formation and or the limited thickness of the hydrocarbon layer. For example the wellbores may be placed above or below natural seals in the formation without punching large numbers of holes in the natural seals as would be needed with vertically oriented wellbores. Using substantially u shaped wellbores instead of vertical wellbores may also reduce the number of wells needed to treat a surface footprint of the formation. Using less wells reduces capital costs for equipment and reduces the environmental impact of treating the formation by reducing the amount of wellbores on the surface and the amount of equipment on the surface. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also utilize a lower ratio of overburden section to heated section than vertical wellbores.

Substantially u shaped wellbores may allow for flexible placement of opening of the wellbores on the surface. Openings to the wellbores may be placed according to the surface topology of the formation. In certain embodiments the openings of wellbores are placed at geographically accessible locations such as topological highs for examples hills . For example the wellbore may have a first opening on a first topologic high and a second opening on a second topologic high and the wellbore crosses beneath a topologic low for example a valley with alluvial fill between the first and second topologic highs. This placement of the openings may avoid placing openings or equipment in topologic lows or other inaccessible locations. In addition the water level may not be artesian in topologically high areas. Wellbores may be drilled so that the openings are not located near environmentally sensitive areas such as but not limited to streams nesting areas or animal refuges.

In certain embodiments portions of heating elements are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal heating elements. In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal temperature limited heating elements. Heating elements may include ferromagnetic materials such as 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel like 410 stainless steel chromium stainless steels such as T P91 or T P92 409 stainless steel VM12 Vallourec and Mannesmann Tubes France or iron cobalt alloys for use as temperature limited heaters. In some embodiments heating elements are composite temperature limited heating elements such as 410 stainless steel and copper composite heating elements or 347H iron copper composite heating elements. Heating elements may have lengths of at least about 100 m at least about 500 m or at least about 1000 m up to lengths of about 6000 m.

Heating elements may be solid rods or tubulars. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements have diameters several times the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the solid rod heating elements may have diameters of 1.91 cm or larger for example 2.5 cm 3.2 cm 3.81 cm or 5.1 cm . In certain embodiments tubular heating elements have wall thicknesses of at least twice the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the tubular heating elements have outside diameters of between about 2.5 cm and about 15.2 cm and wall thickness in range between about 0.13 cm and about 1.01 cm.

In certain embodiments tubular heating elements allow fluids to be convected through the tubular heating elements. Fluid flowing through the tubular heating elements may be used to preheat the tubular heating elements to initially heat the formation and or to recover heat from the formation after heating is completed for the in situ conversion process. Fluids that may be flow through the tubular heating elements include but are not limited to air water steam helium carbon dioxide or other fluids. In some embodiments a hot fluid such as carbon dioxide or helium flows through the tubular heating elements to provide heat to the formation. The hot fluid may be used to provide heat to the formation before electrical heating is used to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments the hot fluid is used to provide heat in addition to electrical heating. Using the hot fluid to provide heat to the formation in addition to providing electrical heating may be less expensive than using electrical heating alone to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments water and or steam flows through the tubular heating element to recover heat from the formation. The heated water and or steam may be used for solution mining and or other processes.

Transition sections may couple heating elements to sections . In certain embodiments transition sections include material that has a high electrical conductivity but is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over copper. In an embodiment transition sections include a composite of stainless steel clad over copper. Transition sections inhibit overheating of copper and or insulation in sections .

As depicted in cables may be coupled to transformer and one or more heater units such as the heater unit including heaters A B C. Cables may carry a large amount of power. In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. . Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer to the heaters.

In certain embodiments bus bar A is coupled to first end portions of heaters A L and bus bar B is coupled to second end portions of heaters A L. Bus bars A B electrically couple heaters A L to cables and transformer . Bus bars A B distribute power to heaters A L. In certain embodiments bus bars A B are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. In some embodiments bus bars A B are made of superconducting material such as the superconductor material used in cables .

As shown in heaters A L are coupled to a single transformer . In certain embodiments transformer is a source of time varying current. In certain embodiments transformer is an electrically isolated single phase transformer. In certain embodiments transformer provides power to heaters A L from an isolated secondary phase of the transformer. First end portions of heaters A L may be coupled to one side of transformer while second end portions of the heaters are coupled to the opposite side of the transformer. Transformer provides a substantially common voltage to the first end portions of heaters A L and a substantially common voltage to the second end portions of heaters A L. In certain embodiments transformer applies a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A L that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. For example a 660 V potential may be applied to the first end portions of heaters A L and a 660 V potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters at a selected point on the wave of time varying current such as AC or modulated DC . Thus the voltages at the two end portion of the heaters may be equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity with an average voltage that is substantially at ground potential.

Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A L produces voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. depicts a cross sectional representation along a vertical plane such as the plane A A shown in of substantially u shaped heaters in a hydrocarbon layer. The voltage potential at the cross sectional point shown in along the length of heater A is substantially the same as the voltage potential at the corresponding cross sectional points on heaters A L shown in . At lines equidistant between heater wellheads the voltage potential is approximately zero. Other wells such as production wells or monitoring wells may be located along these zero voltage potential lines if desired. Production wells located close to the overburden may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a vapor phase to the surface. Production wells located close to a bottom of the heated portion of the formation may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a liquid phase to the surface.

In certain embodiments the voltage potential at the midpoint of heaters A L is about zero. Having similar voltage potentials along the lengths of heaters A L inhibits current leakage between the heaters. Thus there is little or no current flow in the formation and the heaters may have long lengths as described above. Having the opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials at the end portions of the heaters also halves the voltage applied at either end portion of the heater versus having one end portion of the heater grounded and one end portion at full potential. Reducing halving the voltage potential applied to an end portion of the heater generally reduces current leakage reduces insulator requirements and or reduces arcing distances because of the lower voltage potential to ground applied at the end portions of the heaters.

In certain embodiments substantially vertical heaters are used to provide heat to the formation. Opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials as described above may be applied to the end portions of the substantially vertical heaters. depicts a side view representation of substantially vertical heaters coupled to a substantially horizontal wellbore. Heaters A B C D E F are located substantially vertical in hydrocarbon layer . First end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar A on a surface of the formation. Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar B in contacting section .

Bus bar B may be a bus bar located in a substantially horizontal wellbore in contacting section . Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F may be coupled to bus bar B by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to bus bar B for example by welding or brazing the containers to the bus bar end portions of heaters A B C D E F are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the heaters to the bus bar. The containers may be coupled to bus bar B by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in bus bar B or coupled to the outside of the bus bar and then brazing or welding the containers to the bus bar.

Bus bar A and bus bar B may be coupled to transformer with cables as described above. Transformer may provide voltages to bar A and bus bar B as described above for the embodiments depicted in . For example transformer may apply a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A F that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may produce voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may inhibit current leakage between the heaters and or into the formation.

In certain embodiments it may be advantageous to allow some current leakage into the formation during early stages of heating to heat the formation at a faster rate. Current leakage from the heaters into the formation electrically heats the formation directly. The formation is heated by direct electrical heating in addition to conductive heat provided by the heaters. The formation the hydrocarbon layer may have an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m. Direct electrical heating is achieved by having opposite potentials applied to adjacent heaters in the hydrocarbon layer. Current may be allowed to leak into the formation until a selected temperature is reached in the heaters or in the formation. The selected temperature may be below or near the temperature that water proximate one or more heaters boils off. After water boils off the hydrocarbon layer is substantially electrically isolated from the heaters and direct heating of the formation is inefficient. After the selected temperature is reached the voltage potential is applied in the opposite polarity and substantially equal magnitude manner described above for so that adjacent heaters will have the same voltage potential along their lengths.

Current is allowed to leak into the formation by reversing the polarity of one or more heaters shown in so that a first group of heaters has a positive voltage potential at first location and a second group of heaters has a negative voltage potential at the first location. The first end portions at first location of a first group of heaters for example heaters A B D E G H J K depicted in are applied with a positive voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to a negative voltage potential applied to the second end portions at second location of the first group of heaters. The first end portions at first location of the second group of heaters for example heaters C F L are applied with a negative voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to the positive voltage potential applied to the first end portions of the first group of heaters. Similarly the second end portions at second location of the second group of heaters are applied with a positive voltage potential substantially equal in magnitude to the negative potential applied to the second end portions of the first group of heaters. After the selected temperature is reached the first end portions of both groups of heaters are applied with voltage potential that is opposite in polarity and substantially similar in magnitude to the voltage potential applied to the second end portions of both groups of heaters.

In some embodiments heating elements have a thin electrically insulating layer described above to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. The thin electrically insulating layer may inhibit heating elements of a three phase heater from leaking current between the elements from leaking current into the formation and from leaking current to other heaters in the formation. Thus the three phase heater may have a longer heater length.

In certain embodiments a heater becomes electrically isolated from the formation because the heater has little or no voltage potential on the outside of the heater. depicts an embodiment of a substantially u shaped heater that electrically isolates itself from the formation. Heater has a first end portion at a first opening on surface and a second end portion at a second opening on the surface. In some embodiments heater has only one end portion coupled to the surface.

Heater includes heating element located in hydrocarbon layer . Heating element is a ferromagnetic conduit heating element or ferromagnetic tubular heating element. In certain embodiments heating element is a temperature limited heater tubular heating element. In certain embodiments heating element is a 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel tubular such as a 410 stainless steel tubular a T P91 stainless steel tubular or a T P92 stainless steel tubular. Heating element is coupled to sections . Sections are located in overburden . Sections include higher electrical conductivity materials such as copper or aluminum. In certain embodiments sections are copper clad inside carbon steel.

Center conductor is located at or near a center of heating element . In one embodiment center conductor is an insulated conductor such as a mineral insulated conductor with a copper core magnesium oxide insulation and a stainless steel sheath . In an alternative embodiment center conductor is a conductor separated from heating element by one or more electrically insulating centralizers so that the heater is in a conductor in conduit configuration. The centralizers may include silicon nitride or another electrically insulating material.

Center conductor is electrically coupled to heating element at an end portion of the center conductor and the heating element at surface as shown by coupling in . Center conductor is used as a return conductor for heating element so that current in the center conductor flows in an opposite direction from current in the heating element. The magnetic field generated by current flow in center conductor substantially confines the flow of electrons and heat generation to the inside of heating element below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the heating element. Thus the outside of heating element is at substantially zero potential and the heating element is electrically isolated from the formation and any adjacent heater or heating element. In some embodiments a fluid such as carbon dioxide or another fluid with a high heat capacity flows through heating element to preheat the formation and or to recover heat from the heating element.

Heating element A is placed in opening A in hydrocarbon layer A. Overburden casing is placed along the relatively vertical walls of openings in hydrocarbon layer B. Overburden casing inhibits heat transfer to hydrocarbon layer B while heat is provided to hydrocarbon layer A by heating element A. Heating element A is used to provide heat to hydrocarbon layer A. Formation fluids such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from hydrocarbon layer A.

Heat may be provided to hydrocarbon layer A by heating element A for a selected length of time. The selected length of time may be based on a variety of factors including but not limited to formation characteristics present or future economic factors or capital costs. For example for an oil shale formation hydrocarbon layer A may have a richness of about 0.12 L kg 30.5 gals ton so the layer is heated for about 25 years. Production of formation fluids from hydrocarbon layer A may continue from the layer until production slows down to an uneconomical rate.

After hydrocarbon layer A is heated for the selected time heating element A is turned off. Heating element A may be pulled firmly for example yanked upwards so that the heating element breaks off at links . Links may be weak links designed to pull apart when a selected or sufficient amount of pulling force is applied to the links. The upper portions of heating element A are then pulled out of the formation and the substantially horizontal portion of heating element A is left in opening A as shown in . In some embodiments only one link may be broken so that the upper portion above the one link can be removed and the remaining portions of the heater can be removed by pulling on the opposite end of the heater. Thus the entire length of heating element A may be removed from the formation.

After upper portions of heating element A are removed from openings plugs may be placed into openings at a selected location in hydrocarbon layer B as depicted in . In certain embodiments plugs are placed into openings at or near impermeable zone . Packing may be placed into openings above plugs . In some embodiments packing is filled into openings without plugs in the openings.

After plugs and or packing is set into place in openings substantially horizontal opening B may be formed in hydrocarbon layer B through casing . Heating element B is placed into opening B. Heating element B is used to provide heat to hydrocarbon layer B. Formation fluids such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from hydrocarbon layer B.

Heating hydrocarbon layers A B in the time sequenced manner described above may be more economical than producing from only one layer or using vertical heaters to provide heat to the layers simultaneously. Using relatively vertical openings to access both hydrocarbon layers at different times may save on capital costs associated with forming openings in the formation and providing surface facilities to power the heating elements. Heating hydrocarbon layer A first before heating hydrocarbon layer B may improve the economics of treating the formation for example the net present value of a project to treat the formation . In addition impermeable zone and packing may provide a seal for hydrocarbon layer A after heating and production from the layer. This seal may be useful for abandonment of the hydrocarbon layer after treating the hydrocarbon layer.

In certain embodiments portions of the wellbore that extend through the overburden include casings. The casings may include materials that inhibit inductive effects in the casings. Inhibiting inductive effects in the casings may inhibit induced currents in the casing and or reduce heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments the overburden casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated PVC CPVC or high density polyethylene HDPE . HDPEs with working temperatures in a usable range include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. . In some embodiments overburden casings may include non magnetic metals such as aluminum or non magnetic alloys such as manganese steels having at least 10 manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 aluminum or austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel. In some embodiments overburden casings may include carbon steel or other ferromagnetic material coupled on the inside diameter to a highly conductive non ferromagnetic metal for example copper or aluminum to inhibit inductive effects or skin effects.

In certain embodiments wellheads for the wellbores may be made of one or more non ferromagnetic materials. The wellheads may include fiberglass PVC CPVC HDPE and or non magnetic alloys or metals. Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead may inhibit undesired heating of components in the wellhead. Ferromagnetic materials used in the wellhead may be electrically and or thermally insulated from other components of the wellhead. In some embodiments an inert gas for example nitrogen or argon is purged inside the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In some embodiments two or more substantially horizontal wellbores are branched off of a first substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from a first location on a surface of the formation. The substantially horizontal wellbores may be substantially parallel through a hydrocarbon layer. The substantially horizontal wellbores may reconnect at a second substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards at a second location on the surface of the formation. Having multiple wellbores branching off of a single substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from the surface reduces the number of openings made at the surface of the formation.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a single ferromagnetic conductor with current returning through the formation. The heating element may be a ferromagnetic tubular in an embodiment 446 stainless steel with 25 by weight chromium and a Curie temperature above 620 C. clad over 304H 316H or 347H stainless steel that extends through the heated target section and makes electrical contact to the formation in an electrical contacting section. The electrical contacting section may be located below a heated target section in the underburden of the formation. In an embodiment the electrical contacting section is a section 60 m deep with a larger diameter than the heater wellbore. The tubular in the electrical contacting section is a high electrical conductivity metal. The annulus in the electrical contacting section may be filled with a contact material solution such as brine or other materials that enhance electrical contact with the formation for example metal beads hematite and or graphite based cement . The electrical contacting section may be located in a low resistivity brine saturated zone with higher porosity to maintain electrical contact through the brine. In the electrical contacting section the tubular diameter may also be increased to allow maximum current flow into the formation with lower heat dissipation in the fluid. Current may flow through the ferromagnetic tubular in the heated section and heat the tubular.

Contacting wellbore may be for example a section of about 60 m deep with a larger diameter wellbore than opening . The annulus of contacting wellbore may be filled with contact solution . Contact solution may be brine or other material such as graphite based cement electrically conducting particles such as hematite or metal coated sand or beads that enhances electrical contact in contacting section . In some embodiments contacting section is a low resistivity brine saturated zone that maintains electrical contact through the brine. Contacting wellbore may be under reamed to a larger diameter for example a diameter between about 25 cm and about 50 cm to allow maximum current flow into contacting section with low heat output. Current may flow through heating element boiling moisture from the wellbore and heating until the heat output reduces near or at the Curie temperature.

In an embodiment three phase temperature limited heaters are made with current connection through the formation. Each heater includes a single Curie temperature heating element with an electrical contacting section in a brine saturated zone below a heated target section. In an embodiment three such heaters are connected electrically at the surface in a three phase wye configuration. The heaters may be deployed in a triangular pattern from the surface. In certain embodiments the current returns through the earth to a neutral point between the three heaters. The three phase Curie heaters may be replicated in a pattern that covers the entire formation.

In certain embodiments legs are coupled in a three phase wye configuration. In some embodiments legs along with one or more other legs are coupled through wellbore in a single phase configuration in which the legs are alternately biased positively and negatively so that current alternately runs up and down the legs. In some embodiments legs are single phase heaters with current returning to the surface through wellbore .

In certain embodiments legs are electrically coupled in contacting wellbores using contact solution . Contact solution may be located in individual contacting wellbores or may be located along the length of the horizontal portion of wellbore . In some embodiments electrical contact is made between legs and or materials in wellbore through other methods for example contactors or contacting elements such as funnels guides or catchers .

A section of heater through a high thermal conductivity zone may be tailored to deliver more heat dissipation in the high thermal conductivity zone. Tailoring of the heater may be achieved by changing cross sectional areas of the heating elements for example by changing ratios of copper to iron and or using different metals in the heating elements. Thermal conductance of the insulation layer may also be modified in certain sections to control the thermal output to raise or lower the apparent Curie temperature zone.

In an embodiment the temperature limited heater includes a hollow core or hollow inner conductor. Layers forming the heater may be perforated to allow fluids from the wellbore for example formation fluids or water to enter the hollow core. Fluids in the hollow core may be transported for example pumped or gas lifted to the surface through the hollow core. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater with the hollow core or the hollow inner conductor is used as a heater production well or a production well. Fluids such as steam may be injected into the formation through the hollow inner conductor.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater is utilized for heavy oil applications for example treatment of relatively permeable formations or tar sands formations . A temperature limited heater may provide a relatively low Curie temperature so that a maximum average operating temperature of the heater is less than 350 C. 300 C. 250 C. 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. In an embodiment for example for a tar sands formation a maximum temperature of the heater is less than about 250 C. to inhibit olefin generation and production of other cracked products. In some embodiments a maximum temperature of the heater above about 250 C. is used to produce lighter hydrocarbon products. For example the maximum temperature of the heater may be at or less than about 500 C.

A heater may heat a volume of formation adjacent to a production wellbore a near production wellbore region so that the temperature of fluid in the production wellbore and in the volume adjacent to the production wellbore is less than the temperature that causes degradation of the fluid. The heat source may be located in the production wellbore or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments the heat source is a temperature limited heater. In some embodiments two or more heat sources may supply heat to the volume. Heat from the heat source may reduce the viscosity of crude oil in or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments heat from the heat source mobilizes fluids in or near the production wellbore and or enhances the radial flow of fluids to the production wellbore. In some embodiments reducing the viscosity of crude oil allows or enhances gas lifting of heavy oil approximately at most 10 API gravity oil or intermediate gravity oil approximately 12 to 20 API gravity oil from the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the initial API gravity of oil in the formation is at most 10 at most 20 at most 25 or at most 30 . In certain embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.05 Pa s 50 cp . In some embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.10 Pa s 100 cp at least 0.15 Pa s 150 cp or at least at least 0.20 Pa s 200 cp . Large amounts of natural gas may have to be utilized to provide gas lift of oil with viscosities above 0.05 Pa s. Reducing the viscosity of oil at or near the production wellbore in the formation to a viscosity of 0.05 Pa s 50 cp 0.03 Pa s 30 cp 0.02 Pa s 20 cp 0.01 Pa s 10 cp or less down to 0.001 Pa s 1 cp or lower lowers the amount of natural gas needed to lift oil from the formation. In some embodiments reduced viscosity oil is produced by other methods such as pumping.

The rate of production of oil from the formation may be increased by raising the temperature at or near a production wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the oil in the formation in and adjacent to the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the rate of production of oil from the formation is increased by 2 times 3 times 4 times or greater up to 20 times over standard cold production which has no external heating of formation during production. Certain formations may be more economically viable for enhanced oil production using the heating of the near production wellbore region. Formations that have a cold production rate approximately between 0.05 m3 day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m3 day per meter of wellbore length may have significant improvements in production rate using heating to reduce the viscosity in the near production wellbore region. In some formations production wells up to 775 m up to 1000 m or up to 1500 m in length are used. For example production wells between 450 m and 775 m in length are used between 550 m and 800 m are used or between 650 m and 900 m are used. Thus a significant increase in production is achievable in some formations. Heating the near production wellbore region may be used in formations where the cold production rate is not between 0.05 m3 day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m3 day per meter of wellbore length but heating such formations may not be as economically favorable. Higher cold production rates may not be significantly increased by heating the near wellbore region while lower production rates may not be increased to an economically useful value.

Using the temperature limited heater to reduce the viscosity of oil at or near the production well inhibits problems associated with non temperature limited heaters and heating the oil in the formation due to hot spots. One possible problem is that non temperature limited heaters can causing coking of oil at or near the production well if the heater overheats the oil because the heaters are at too high a temperature. Higher temperatures in the production well may also cause brine to boil in the well which may lead to scale formation in the well. Non temperature limited heaters that reach higher temperatures may also cause damage to other wellbore components for example screens used for sand control pumps or valves . Hot spots may be caused by portions of the formation expanding against or collapsing on the heater. In some embodiments the heater either the temperature limited heater or another type of non temperature limited heater has sections that are lower because of sagging over long heater distances. These lower sections may sit in heavy oil or bitumen that collects in lower portions of the wellbore. At these lower sections the heater may develop hot spots due to coking of the heavy oil or bitumen. A standard non temperature limited heater may overheat at these hot spots thus producing a non uniform amount of heat along the length of the heater. Using the temperature limited heater may inhibit overheating of the heater at hot spots or lower sections and provide more uniform heating along the length of the wellbore.

In some embodiments oil or bitumen cokes in a perforated liner or screen in a heater production wellbore for example coke may form between the heater and the liner or between the liner and the formation . Oil or bitumen may also coke in a toe section of a heel and toe heater production wellbore as shown in and described below for . A temperature limited heater may limit a temperature of a heater production wellbore below a coking temperature to inhibit coking in the well so that the wellbore does not plug up.

In certain embodiments fluids in the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons are produced with little or no pyrolyzation of hydrocarbons in the formation. In certain embodiments the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons is a tar sands formation. The fluids produced from the formation are mobilized fluids. Producing mobilized fluids may be more economical than producing pyrolyzed fluids from the tar sands formation. Producing mobilized fluids may also increase the total amount of hydrocarbons produced from the tar sands formation.

Production wells are located below heaters in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . Production wells are located below and near heaters at the bottom vertex of the triangular pattern of heaters. Production wells are substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters in hydrocarbon layer . Locating production wells substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters provides efficient collection of mobilized fluids in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments production wells are located within about 2 m within about 5 m or within about 7 m of the bottommost heaters. In some embodiments some heat is provided in production wells . Providing heat in production wells maintains the mobility of the fluids in the production wells.

Heaters are used to heat the second portion of hydrocarbon layer to pyrolysis temperatures. Second hydrocarbons are produced from the first portion through production well B. In certain embodiments the second hydrocarbons include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments the second hydrocarbons have an API gravity of at least 15 at least 20 or at least 25 .

Producing hydrocarbons through both processes increases the total recovery of hydrocarbons from hydrocarbon layer and may be more economical than using either process alone. In some embodiments the first portion is treated with the in situ conversion process after the steam injection process is completed. For example after the steam injection process no longer produces viable amounts of hydrocarbon from the first portion the in situ conversion process may be used on the first portion.

In some embodiments first hydrocarbons and or second hydrocarbons are treated for example removing undesirable products before being used as fuel for facility . The amount of first hydrocarbons and second hydrocarbons used as fuel for facility may be determined for example by economics for the overall process the marketplace for either first or second hydrocarbons availability of treatment facilities for either first or second hydrocarbons and or transportation facilities available for either first or second hydrocarbons. In some embodiments most or all the hydrocarbon gas produced from hydrocarbon layer is used as fuel for facility .

In some embodiments treated hydrocarbons are used in facility .

Conduit may be made from carbon steel or more corrosion resistant materials such as stainless steel. Conduit may include apparatus and mechanisms for gas lifting or pumping produced oil to the surface. For example conduit includes gas lift valves used in a gas lift process. Examples of gas lift control systems and valves are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 715 550 to Vinegar et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0036085 to Bass et al. and 2003 0038734 to Hirsch et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Conduit may include one or more openings perforations to allow fluid to flow into the production conduit. In certain embodiments the openings in conduit are in a portion of the conduit that remains below the liquid level in wellbore . For example the openings are in a horizontal portion of conduit .

Heater is located in conduit as shown in . In some embodiments heater is located outside conduit as shown in . The heater located outside the production conduit may be coupled strapped to the production conduit. In some embodiments more than one heater for example two three or four heaters are placed about conduit . The use of more than one heater may reduce bowing or flexing of the production conduit caused by heating on only one side of the production conduit. In an embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater. Heater provides heat to reduce the viscosity of fluid such as oil or hydrocarbons in and near wellbore . In certain embodiments heater raises the temperature of the fluid in wellbore up to a temperature of 250 C. or less for example 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. . Heater may be at higher temperatures for example 275 C. 300 C. or 325 C. because the heater provides heat to conduit and there is some temperature differential between the heater and the conduit. Thus heat produced from the heater does not raise the temperature of fluids in the wellbore above 250 C.

In certain embodiments heater includes ferromagnetic materials such as Carpenter Temperature Compensator 32 Alloy 42 6 Alloy 52 Invar 36 or other iron nickel or iron nickel chromium alloys. In certain embodiments nickel or nickel chromium alloys are used in heater . In some embodiments heater includes a composite conductor with a more highly conductive material such as copper on the inside of the heater to improve the turndown ratio of the heater. Heat from heater heats fluids in or near wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the fluids and increase a production rate through conduit .

In certain embodiments portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore such as the vertical portion of the wellbore depicted in have a lower maximum temperature than portions of the heater located below the liquid level. For example portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore may have a maximum temperature of 100 C. while portions of the heater located below the liquid level have a maximum temperature of 250 C. In certain embodiments such a heater includes two or more ferromagnetic sections with different Curie temperatures to achieve the desired heating pattern. Providing less heat to portions of wellbore above the liquid level and closer to the surface may save energy.

In certain embodiments heater is electrically isolated on the heater s outside surface and allowed to move freely in conduit . In some embodiments electrically insulating centralizers are placed on the outside of heater to maintain a gap between conduit and the heater.

In some embodiments heater is cycled turned on and off so that fluids produced through conduit are not overheated. In an embodiment heater is turned on for a specified amount of time until a temperature of fluids in or near wellbore reaches a desired temperature for example the maximum temperature of the heater . During the heating time for example 10 days 20 days or 30 days production through conduit may be stopped to allow fluids in the formation to soak and obtain a reduced viscosity. After heating is turned off or reduced production through conduit is started and fluids from the formation are produced without excess heat being provided to the fluids. During production fluids in or near wellbore will cool down without heat from heater being provided. When the fluids reach a temperature at which production significantly slows down production is stopped and heater is turned back on to reheat the fluids. This process may be repeated until a desired amount of production is reached. In some embodiments some heat at a lower temperature is provided to maintain a flow of the produced fluids. For example low temperature heat for example 100 C. 125 C. or 150 C. may be provided in the upper portions of wellbore to keep fluids from cooling to a lower temperature.

Opening is located at or near a junction of heater and conduit . In some embodiments opening is a slot or a slit in conduit . In some embodiments opening includes more than one opening in conduit . Opening allows production fluids to flow into conduit from a wellbore. Perforated casing allows fluids to flow into the heating production assembly . In certain embodiments perforated casing is a wire wrapped screen. In one embodiment perforated casing is a 9 cm diameter wire wrapped screen.

Perforated casing may be coupled to casing with packing material . Packing material inhibits fluids from flowing into casing from outside perforated casing . Packing material may also be placed inside casing to inhibit fluids from flowing up the annulus between the casing and conduit . Seal assembly is used to seal conduit to packing material . Seal assembly may fix a position of conduit along a length of a wellbore. In some embodiments seal assembly allows for unsealing of conduit so that the production conduit and heater may be removed from the wellbore.

Feedthrough is used to pass lead in cable to supply power to heater . Lead in cable may be secured to conduit with clamp . In some embodiments lead in cable passes through packing material using a separate feedthrough.

A lifting gas for example natural gas methane carbon dioxide propane and or nitrogen may be provided to the annulus between conduit and casing . Valves are located along a length of conduit to allow gas to enter the production conduit and provide for gas lifting of fluids in the production conduit. The lifting gas may mix with fluids in conduit to lower the density of the fluids and allow for gas lifting of the fluids out of the formation. In certain embodiments valves are located in or near the overburden section of the formation so that gas lifting is provided in the overburden section. In some embodiments fluids are produced through the annulus between conduit and casing and the lifting gas is supplied through valves .

In an embodiment fluids are produced using a pump coupled to conduit . The pump may be a submersible pump for example an electric or gas powered submersible pump . In some embodiments a heater is coupled to conduit to maintain the reduced viscosity of fluids in the conduit and or the pump.

In certain embodiments an additional conduit such as an additional coiled tubing conduit is placed in the formation. Sensors may be placed in the additional conduit. For example a production logging tool may be placed in the additional conduit to identify locations of producing zones and or to assess flow rates. In some embodiments a temperature sensor for example a distributed temperature sensor a fiber optic sensor and or an array of thermocouples is placed in the additional conduit to determine a subsurface temperature profile.

Some embodiments of the heating production assembly are used in a well that preexists for example the heating production assembly is retrofitted for a preexisting production well heater well or monitoring well . An example of the heating production assembly that may be used in the preexisting well is depicted in . Some preexisting wells include a pump. The pump in the preexisting well may be left in the heating production well retrofitted with the heating production assembly.

In some embodiments heat is inhibited from transferring into conduit . depicts an embodiment of conduit and heaters that inhibit heat transfer into the conduit. Heaters are coupled to conduit . Heaters include ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections . Ferromagnetic sections provide heat at a temperature that reduces the viscosity of fluids in or near a wellbore. Non ferromagnetic sections provide little or no heat. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections are 6 m in length. In some embodiments ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections are between 3 m and 12 m in length between 4 m and 11 m in length or between 5 m and 10 m in length. In certain embodiments non ferromagnetic sections include perforations to allow fluids to flow to conduit . In some embodiments heater is positioned so that perforations are not needed to allow fluids to flow to conduit .

Conduit may have perforations to allow fluid to enter the conduit. Perforations coincide with non ferromagnetic sections of heater . Sections of conduit that coincide with ferromagnetic sections include insulation conduit . Conduit may be a vacuum insulated tubular. For example conduit may be a vacuum insulated production tubular available from Oil Tech Services Inc. Houston Tex. U.S.A. . Conduit inhibits heat transfer into conduit from ferromagnetic sections . Limiting the heat transfer into conduit reduces heat loss and or inhibits overheating of fluids in the conduit. In an embodiment heater provides heat along an entire length of the heater and conduit includes conduit along an entire length of the production conduit.

In certain embodiments more than one wellbore is used to produce heavy oils from a formation using the temperature limited heater. depicts an end view of an embodiment with wellbores located in hydrocarbon layer . Portions of wellbores are placed substantially horizontally in a triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments wellbores have a spacing of 30 m to 60 m 35 m to 55 m or 40 m to 50 m. Wellbores may include production conduits and heaters previously described. Fluids may be heated and produced through wellbores at an increased production rate above a cold production rate for the formation. Production may continue for a selected time for example 5 years to 10 years 6 years to 9 years or 7 years to 8 years until heat produced from each of wellbores begins to overlap superposition of heat begins . At such a time heat from lower wellbores such as wellbores near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer is continued reduced or turned off while production is continued. Production in upper wellbores such as wellbores near the top of hydrocarbon layer may be stopped so that fluids in the hydrocarbon layer drain towards the lower wellbores. In some embodiments power is increased to the upper wellbores and the temperature raised above the Curie temperature to increase the heat injection rate. Draining fluids in the formation in such a process increases total hydrocarbon recovery from the formation.

In an embodiment a temperature limited heater is used in a horizontal heater production well. The temperature limited heater may provide selected amounts of heat to the toe and the heel of the horizontal portion of the well. More heat may be provided to the formation through the toe than through the heel creating a hot portion at the toe and a warm portion at the heel. Formation fluids may be formed in the hot portion and produced through the warm portion as shown in .

In an embodiment heat source includes warm portion . Warm portion is a portion of heat source that operates at lower heat outputs than hot portion . For example warm portion may output between 30 W m and 1000 W m 30 W m and 750 W m or 100 W m and 750 W m. Warm portion may be located closer to the heel of heat source . In certain embodiments warm portion is a transition portion for example a transition conductor between hot portion and overburden portion . Overburden portion is located in overburden . Overburden portion provides a lower heat output than warm portion . For example overburden portion may output between 10 W m and 90 W m 15 W m and 80 W m or 25 W m and 75 W m. In some embodiments overburden portion provides as close to no heat 0 W m as possible to overburden . Some heat however may be used to maintain fluids produced through opening in a vapor phase or at elevated temperature in overburden .

In certain embodiments hot portion of heat source heats hydrocarbons to high enough temperatures to result in coke forming in hydrocarbon layer . Coke may occur in an area surrounding opening . Warm portion may be operated at lower heat outputs so that coke does not form at or near the warm portion of heat source . Coke may extend radially from opening as heat from heat source transfers outward from the opening. At a certain distance however coke no longer forms because temperatures in hydrocarbon layer at the certain distance will not reach coking temperatures. The distance at which no coke forms is a function of heat output W m from heat source type of formation hydrocarbon content in the formation and or other conditions in the formation.

The formation of coke inhibits fluid flow into opening through the coking. Fluids in the formation may however be produced through opening at the heel of heat source for example at warm portion of the heat source where there is little or no coke formation. The lower temperatures at the heel of heat source reduce the possibility of increased cracking of formation fluids produced through the heel. Fluids may flow in a horizontal direction through the formation more easily than in a vertical direction. Typically horizontal permeability in a relatively permeable formation is approximately 5 to 10 times greater than vertical permeability. Thus fluids flow along the length of heat source in a substantially horizontal direction. Producing formation fluids through opening is possible at earlier times than producing fluids through production wells in hydrocarbon layer . The earlier production times through opening is possible because temperatures near the opening increase faster than temperatures further away due to conduction of heat from heat source through hydrocarbon layer . Early production of formation fluids may be used to maintain lower pressures in hydrocarbon layer during start up heating of the formation. Start up heating of the formation is the time of heating before production begins at production wells in the formation. Lower pressures in the formation may increase liquid production from the formation. In addition producing formation fluids through opening may reduce the number of production wells needed in the formation.

In some embodiments a temperature limited heater is used to heat a surface pipeline such as a sulfur transfer pipeline. For example a surface sulfur pipeline may be heated to a temperature of about 100 C. about 110 C. or about 130 C. to inhibit solidification of fluids in the pipeline. Higher temperatures in the pipeline for example above about 130 C. may induce undesirable degradation of fluids in the pipeline.

In some embodiments a temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore heats steam that is provided to the wellbore. The heated steam may be introduced into a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments the heated steam may be used as a heat transfer fluid to heat a portion of the formation. In some embodiments the steam is used to solution mine desired minerals from the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater positioned in the wellbore heats liquid water that is introduced into a portion of the formation.

In an embodiment the temperature limited heater includes ferromagnetic material with a selected Curie temperature. The use of a temperature limited heater may inhibit a temperature of the heater from increasing beyond a maximum selected temperature for example at or about the Curie temperature . Limiting the temperature of the heater may inhibit potential burnout of the heater. The maximum selected temperature may be a temperature selected to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions superheated conditions or supercritical conditions. Using a temperature limited heater to heat the steam may inhibit overheating of the steam in the wellbore. Steam introduced into a formation may be used for synthesis gas production to heat the hydrocarbon containing formation to carry chemicals into the formation to extract chemicals or minerals from the formation and or to control heating of the formation.

A portion of the formation where steam is introduced or that is heated with steam may be at significant depths below the surface for example greater than about 1000 m about 2500 or about 5000 m below the surface . If steam is heated at the surface of the formation and introduced to the formation through a wellbore a quality of the heated steam provided to the wellbore at the surface may have to be relatively high to accommodate heat losses to the wellbore casing and or the overburden as the steam travels down the wellbore. Heating the steam in the wellbore may allow the quality of the steam to be significantly improved before the steam is provided to the formation. A temperature limited heater positioned in a lower section of the overburden and or adjacent to a target zone of the formation may be used to controllably heat steam to improve the quality of the steam injected into the formation and or inhibit condensation along the length of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater improves the quality of the steam injected and or inhibits condensation in the wellbore for long steam injection wellbores especially for long horizontal steam injection wellbores .

A temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore may be used to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions or superheated conditions. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater may heat the steam so that the steam is above or near supercritical conditions. The static head of fluid above the temperature limited heater may facilitate producing 100 saturation superheated and or supercritical conditions in the steam. Supercritical or near supercritical steam may be used to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation. In certain embodiments steam introduced into the formation may have a high density for example a specific gravity of about 0.8 or above . Increasing the density of the steam may improve the ability of the steam to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation.

Improved alloys containing manganese copper and tungsten in combination with niobium carbon and nitrogen may maintain a finer grain size despite high temperature solution annealing or processing. Such behavior may be beneficial in reducing a heat affected zone in welded material. Higher solution annealing temperatures are particularly important for achieving the best NbC nano carbide strengthening during high temperature creep service and such effects are amplified finer nano carbide structures that are stable by compositions of the improved alloys. Tubing and canister applications that include the composition of the improved alloys and are wrought processed result in stainless steels that may be able to age harden during service at about 700 C. to about 800 C. Improved alloys may be able to age harden even more if the alloys are cold strained prior to high temperature service. Cold prestraining may degrade rather than enhance high temperature strength and long term durability and therefore may be limited or not permitted by for example construction codes.

An improved alloy may include by weight about 18 to about 22 chromium about 12 to about 13 nickel above 0 to about 4.5 copper about 1 to about 5 manganese about 0.3 to about 1 silicon above 0 to about 1 niobium about 0.3 to about 1 molybdenum about 0.08 to about 0.2 carbon about 0.2 to about 0.5 nitrogen above 0 to about 2 tungsten and with the balance being iron for example about 47.8 to about 68.12 iron . Such an improved alloy may be useful when processed by hot deformation cold deformation and or welding into for example casings canisters or strength members for heaters. In some embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 20 chromium about 3 copper about 4 manganese about 0.3 molybdenum about 0.77 niobium about 13 nickel about 0.5 silicon about 1 tungsten about 0.09 carbon and about 0.26 nitrogen with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 19 chromium about 4.2 manganese about 0.3 molybdenum about 0.8 niobium about 12.5 nickel about 0.5 silicon about 0.09 carbon about 0.24 nitrogen by weight with the balance being iron. In some embodiments improved alloys may vary an amount of manganese amount of nickel and or a Mn Ni ratio to enhance resistance to high temperature sulfidation increase high temperature strength and or reduce cost.

In some embodiments the improved alloys are processed to produce a wrought material. A 6 inside diameter centrifugal cast pipe having a wall thickness of 1.5 may be cast from the improved alloy. A section may be removed from the casting and heat treated at least about 1250 C. for for example about three hours. The heat treated section may be hot rolled at least about 1200 C. to a 0.75 thickness annealed at least about 1200 C. for fifteen minutes and then sandblasted. The sandblasted section may be cold rolled to a thickness of about 0.55 . The cold rolled section may be annealed at least about 1250 C. for about an hour in for example air with an argon cover and then given a final additional heat treatment for about one hour at least about 1250 C. in air with an argon cover. An alternative process may include any of the following initially homogenizing the cast plate at least about 1200 C. for about 1 hours hot rolling at at least about 1200 C. to a 1 thickness and annealing the cold rolled plate for about one hour at least about 1200 C.

The improved alloys may be extruded at for example about 1200 C. with for example a mandrel diameter of 0.9 and a die diameter of 1.35 to produce good quality tubes. The wrought material may be welded by for example laser welding. Thus tubes may be produced by rolling plates and welding seams.

Improved alloys may have high temperature creep strengths and tensile strengths that are superior to conventional alloys. For example niobium stabilized stainless steel alloys that include manganese nitrogen copper and tungsten may have high temperature creep strengths and tensile strengths that are improved or substantially improved relative to conventional alloys such as 347H.

Improved alloys may have increased strength relative to standard stainless steel alloys such as Super 304H at high temperatures for example about 700 C. about 800 C. or above 1000 C. . Superior high temperature creep rupture strength for example creep rupture strength at about 800 C. about 900 C. or about 1250 C. may be improved as a result of a composition b stable fine grain microstructures induced by high temperature processing and c age induced precipitation structures in the improved alloys. Precipitation structures include for example micro carbides that strengthen grain boundaries and stable nano carbides that strengthen inside the grains. Presence of phases other than sigma and laves phases contribute to high temperature properties. Stable microstructures may be achieved by proper selection of components. High temperature aging induced or creep induced microstructures have minimal or no intermetallic sigma and laves phases. Intermetallic sigma and lava phases may weaken the strength properties of alloys.

At about 800 C. the improved alloys may include at least 3 by weight of micro carbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. At about 900 C. the improved alloys may include at least 1.5 by weight at least 2 by weight at least 3 by weight at least 3.5 by weight or at least 5 by weight micro carbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. These values may be higher than the corresponding values in 347H or Super 304H stainless steel alloys at about 900 C. At about 1250 C. improved alloys may include at least 0.5 by weight micro carbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. The resulting higher weight percent of micro carbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure and the exclusion of sigma and laves phases may account for superior high temperature performance of the improved alloys.

Alloys having similar or superior high temperature performance to the improved alloys may be derived by modelling phase behaviour at elevated temperatures and selecting compositions that retain at least 1.5 2 or 2.5 by weight of phases other than sigma or laves phases at for example about 900 C. For example a stable microstructure may include an amount of niobium that is nearly ten times the amount of carbon along with 1 to 5 of manganese and nitrogen. Copper and tungsten may be included in the composition to increase the amount of stable microstructures. The choice of elements for the improved alloys allows processing by various methods and results in a stable fine grain size even after heat treatments of at least about 1250 C. Many prior art alloys tend to grain coarsen significantly when annealed at such high temperatures. In some embodiments grain size is controlled to achieve desirable high temperature tensile and creep properties. Stable grain structure in the improved alloys reduces grain boundary sliding and may be a contributing factor for the better strength relative to commercially available alloys at temperatures above for example about 650 C.

FIG. 176 depicts data of electrical resistance m versus temperature C. for a composite 0.75 diameter 6 foot long Alloy 52 rod with a 0.375 diameter copper core at various applied electrical currents. Curves and depict resistance profiles as a function of temperature for the copper cored Alloy 52 rod at 300 A AC curve 400 A AC curve 500 A AC curve 600 A AC curve and 10 A DC curve . For the applied AC currents the resistance increased gradually with increasing temperature until around 320 C. After 320 C. the resistance began to decrease gradually decreasing more sharply as the temperature approached the Curie temperature. At the Curie temperature the AC resistance decreased very sharply. In contrast the resistance showed a gradual increase with temperature for the applied DC current. The turndown ratio for the 400 A applied AC current curve was 2.8.

In curves show skin depth profiles as a function of temperature for applied AC electrical currents over a range of 50 amps to 500 amps 50 amps 100 amps 150 amps 200 amps 250 amps 300 amps 350 amps 400 amps 450 amps 500 amps . For each applied AC electrical current the skin depth gradually increased with increasing temperature up to the Curie temperature. At the Curie temperature the skin depth increased sharply.

A 6 foot temperature limited heater element was placed in a 6 foot 347H stainless steel canister. The heater element was connected to the canister in a series configuration. The heater element and canister were placed in an oven. The oven was used to raise the temperature of the heater element and the canister. At varying temperatures a series of electrical currents were passed through the heater element and returned through the canister. The resistance of the heater element and the power factor of the heater element were determined from measurements during passing of the electrical currents.

Data depicts electrical resistance versus temperature for 300 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 500 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC applied current. The resistance versus temperature data indicates that the AC resistance of the temperature limited heater linearly increased up to a temperature near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Near the Curie temperature the AC resistance decreased rapidly until the AC resistance equaled the DC resistance above the Curie temperature. The linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature at least partially reflects the linear dependence of the AC resistance of 347H at these temperatures. Thus the linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures.

Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 100 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC. The AC resistance of this temperature limited heater turned down at a higher temperature than the previous temperature limited heater. This was due to the added cobalt increasing the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The AC resistance was substantially the same as the AC resistance of a tube of 347H steel having the dimensions of the support member. This indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures. The resistance curves in are generally the same shape as the resistance curves in .

From the data in the experiments for the temperature limited heater with the copper core the iron cobalt ferromagnetic conductor and the 347H stainless steel support member the turndown ratio y axis was calculated as a function of the maximum power W m delivered by the temperature limited heater. The results of these calculations are depicted in . The curve in shows that the turndown ratio y axis remains above 2 for heater powers up to approximately 2000 W m. This curve is used to determine the ability of a heater to effectively provide heat output in a sustainable manner. A temperature limited heater with the curve similar to the curve in would be able to provide sufficient heat output while maintaining temperature limiting properties that inhibit the heater from overheating or malfunctioning.

A theoretical model has been used to predict the experimental results. The theoretical model is based on an analytical solution for the AC resistance of a composite conductor. The composite conductor has a thin layer of ferromagnetic material with a relative magnetic permeability 1 sandwiched between two non ferromagnetic materials whose relative magnetic permeabilities and are close to unity and within which skin effects are negligible. An assumption in the model is that the ferromagnetic material is treated as linear. In addition the way in which the relative magnetic permeability is extracted from magnetic data for use in the model is far from rigorous.

EQNS. 13 and 14 are used to express EQNS. 15 and 16 in terms of boundary conditions pertaining to material 2 the ferromagnetic material . This yields 

the boundary conditions in EQNS. 17 and 18 are expressed in terms of Eand its derivatives as follows 

In EQNS. 30 and 31 the short hand notation Eand Eis used for E a and E b respectively and the dimensionless parameters and and normalized current have been introduced. These quantities are given by 

EQN. 32 can be expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters by using EQN. 29. The results are 2 4 . 34 

To obtain an approximate solution of EQN. 25 is assumed to be small enough to be neglected in EQN. 25. This assumption holds if the thickness of the ferromagnetic material material 2 is much less than its mean radius. The general solution then takes the form . 38 Then and 39 . 40 

Substituting EQNS. 38 40 into EQNS. 30 and 31 yields the following set of equations for A and B and 41 42 Rearranging EQN. 41 obtains an expression for B in terms of A 

From EQN. 44 exp with 48 exp 2 and 49 2 where 50 and 51 tan . 52 Then exp exp and 53 exp exp . 54 Hence exp cos exp cos 55A exp sin exp sin 55B exp cos exp cos and 55C exp sin exp sin . 55D 

The ratio of absolute values of currents flowing through the center and outer conductors is then given by 

The total current flowing through the center conductor is given by sin . 57 Now sin 1 sin cos cos sin 2 with 58 sin cos cos sin 4 . 59 Hence cos sin and 60 cos sin . 61 

Furthermore EQNS. 40 42 are used to evaluate the second term on the right hand side of EQN. 29 neglecting the term in . The result is 

Given values for the dimensions a b and c and and which are known functions of temperature and assuming a value for the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material material 2 or equivalently the skin depth A 1 can be set and the AC resistance per unit length Rcan be calculated. The ratio of the root mean square current flowing through the inner conductor material 1 and the ferromagnetic material material 2 to the total can also be calculated. For a given total RMS current then the RMS current flowing through materials 1 and 2 can be calculated which gives the magnetic field at the surface of material 2. Using magnetic data for material 2 a value for can be deduced and hence a value for can be deduced. Plotting this skin depth against the original skin depth produces a pair of curves that cross at the true .

Magnetic data was obtained for carbon steel as a ferromagnetic material. B versus H curves and hence relative permeabilities were obtained from the magnetic data at various temperatures up to 1100 F. and magnetic fields up to 200 Oe oersteds . A correlation was found that fitted the data well through the maximum permeability and beyond. depicts examples of relative magnetic permeability y axis versus magnetic field Oe for both the found correlations and raw data for carbon steel. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 400 F. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 1000 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 400 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 1000 F.

For the dimensions and materials of the copper carbon steel 347H heater element in the experiments above the theoretical calculations described above were carried out to calculate magnetic field at the outer surface of the carbon steel as a function of skin depth. Results of the theoretical calculations were presented on the same plot as skin depth versus magnetic field from the correlations applied to the magnetic data from . The theoretical calculations and correlations were made for four temperatures 200 F. 500 F. 800 F. and 1100 F. and five total root mean square RMS currents 100 A 200 A 300 A 400 A and 500 A .

The skin depths obtained from the intersections of the same temperature curves in were input into the equations described above and the AC resistance per unit length was calculated. The total AC resistance of the entire heater including that of the canister was subsequently calculated. A comparison between the experimental and numerical calculated results is shown in for currents of 300 A experimental data and numerical curve 400 A experimental data and numerical curve and 500 A experimental data and numerical curve . Though the numerical results exhibit a steeper trend than the experimental results the theoretical model captures the close bunching of the experimental data and the overall values are quite reasonable given the assumptions involved in the theoretical model. For example one assumption involved the use of a permeability derived from a quasistatic B H curve to treat a dynamic system.

One feature of the theoretical model describing the flow of alternating current in the three part temperature limited heater is that the AC resistance does not fall off monotonically with increasing skin depth. shows the AC resistance m per foot of the heater element as a function of skin depth in. at 1100 F. calculated from the theoretical model. The AC resistance may be maximized by selecting the skin depth that is at the peak of the non monotonical portion of the resistance versus skin depth profile for example at about 0.23 in. in .

Formulae may be developed that describe the shapes of the AC resistance versus temperature profiles of temperature limited heaters for use in simulating the performance of the heaters in a particular embodiment. The data in show that the resistances initially rise linearly then drop off increasingly steeply towards the DC lines. The resistance versus temperature profile of each heater can be described by and 64 . 65

The parameters T as well as Aand Bare independent of current. Values of the parameters for the copper carbon steel 347H heaters in the above experiments are listed in TABLE 2.

A numerical simulation FLUENT available from Fluent USA Lebanon N.H. U.S.A. was used to compare operation of temperature limited heaters with three turndown ratios. The simulation was done for heaters in an oil shale formation Green River oil shale . Simulation conditions were 

Simulations have been performed to compare the use of temperature limited heaters and non temperature limited heaters in an oil shale formation. Simulation data was produced for conductor in conduit heaters placed in 16.5 cm 6.5 inch diameter wellbores with 12.2 m 40 feet spacing between heaters using a formation simulator for example STARS and a near wellbore simulator for example ABAQUS from ABAQUS Inc. Providence R.I. U.S.A. . Standard conductor in conduit heaters included 304 stainless steel conductors and conduits. Temperature limited conductor in conduit heaters included a metal with a Curie temperature of 760 C. for conductors and conduits. Results from the simulations are depicted in .

Calculations may be made to determine the effect of a thermally conductive fluid in an annulus of a temperature limited heater. The equations below EQNS. 69 79 are used to relate a heater center rod temperature in a heated section to a conduit temperature adjacent to the heater center rod. In this example the heater center rod is a 347H stainless steel tube with outer radius b. The conduit is made of 347H stainless steel and has inner radius R. The center heater rod and the conduit are at uniform temperatures Tand T respectively. Tis maintained constant and a constant heat rate Q per unit length is supplied to the center heater rod. Tis the value at which the rate of heat per unit length transferred to the conduit by conduction and radiation balances the rate of heat generated Q. Conduction across a gap between the center heater rod and inner surface of the conduit is assumed to take place in parallel with radiation across the gap. For simplicity radiation across the gap is assumed to be radiation across a vacuum. The equations are thus 69 

where Qrepresents the conductive component and Qrepresents the radiative component of the heat flux across the gap. Denoting the inner radius of the conduit by R conductive heat transport satisfies the equation

Using silicon nitride centralizers allows for smaller diameter and higher temperature heaters. A smaller gap is needed between a conductor and a conduit because of the excellent electrical characteristics of the silicon nitride. Silicon nitride centralizers may allow higher operating voltages for example up to at least 1500 V 2000 V 2500 V or 15 kV to be used in heaters due to the electrical characteristics of the silicon nitride. Operating at higher voltages allows longer length heaters to be utilized for example lengths up to at least 500 m 1000 m or 1500 m at 2500 V . In some embodiments boron nitride is used as a material for centralizers or other electrical insulators. Boron nitride is a better thermal conductor and has better electrical properties than silicon nitride. Boron nitride does not absorb water readily boron nitride is substantially non hygroscopic . Boron nitride is available in at least a hexagonal form and a face centered cubic form. A hexagonal crystalline formation of boron nitride has several desired properties including but not limited to a high thermal conductivity and a low friction coefficient.

In some embodiments cobalt may be added to 410 stainless steel to decrease the rate of corrosion at elevated temperatures for example temperatures greater than 1200 F. relative to untreated 410 stainless steel. Addition of cobalt to 410 stainless steel may enhance the strength of the stainless steel at high temperatures for example temperatures greater than 1200 F. greater than 1400 F. greater than 1500 F. or greater than 1600 F. and or change the magnetic characteristics of the metal. depicts projected corrosion rates metal loss per year for 410 stainless steel and 410 stainless steel containing various amounts of cobalt in a sulfidation atmosphere.

Bar depicts data for 410 stainless steel with 5 cobalt by weight. Bar depicts data for 410 stainless steel with 10 cobalt by weight. As the amount of cobalt in the 410 stainless steel increases the corrosion rate in a sulfidation atmosphere decreases relative to non cobalt containing 410 stainless steel in a temperature range of about 800 C. to about 880 C.

A STARS simulation Computer Modelling Group LTD. Calgary Alberta Canada determined heating properties using temperature limited heaters with varying power outputs. depicts an example of richness of an oil shale formation gal ton versus depth ft . Upper portions of the formation above about 1210 feet tend to have a leaner richness lower water filled porosity and or less dawsonite than deeper portions of the formation. For the simulation a heater similar to the heater depicted in was used. Portion had a length of 368 feet above the dashed line shown in and portion had a length of 587 feet below the dashed line.

In the first example the temperature limited heater had constant thermal properties along the entire length of the heater. The heater included a 0.565 diameter copper core with a carbon steel conductor Curie temperature of 1418 F. pure iron with outside diameter of 0.825 surrounding the copper core. The outer conductor was 347H stainless steel surrounding the carbon steel conductor with an outside diameter of 1.2 . The resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. profile of the heater is shown in . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the first example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the entire formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation lagged behind the average temperature in the top portion of the formation and the entire formation. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1584 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1922 days. Thus the bottom portion lagged behind the top portion by almost a year to reach an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature.

In the second example portion of the temperature limited heater had the same properties used in the first example. Portion of the heater was altered to have a Curie temperature of 1550 F. by the addition of cobalt to the iron conductor. depicts resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. for the second heater example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the top portion portion . Curve depicts the resistance profile for the bottom portion portion . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the second example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the entire formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation lagged behind the average temperature in the top portion of the formation and the entire formation. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1574 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1701 days. Thus the bottom portion still lagged behind the top portion to reach an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature but the time lag was less than the time lag in the first example.

In the third example dimensions of the top portion portion were altered to provide less power output. Portion was adjusted to have a copper core with an outside diameter of 0.545 a carbon steel conductor with an outside diameter of 0.700 surrounding the copper core and an outer conductor of 347H stainless steel with an outside diameter of 1.2 surrounding the carbon steel conductor. The bottom portion portion had the same properties as the heater in the second example. depicts resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. for the third heater example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the top portion portion . Curve depicts the resistance profile of the top portion in the second example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the bottom portion portion . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the third example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation was approximately the same as the average temperature in the top portion of the formation especially after a time of about 1000 days. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1642 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 644 F. in 1649 days. Thus the bottom portion reached an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature only 5 days later than the top portion.

As a fourth example the STARS simulation was used to determine heating properties of temperature limited heaters with varying power outputs when using the temperature limited heaters in the heater configuration and pattern depicted in . The heater pattern had a 30 foot heater spacing. Portion had a length of 368 feet and portion had a length of 587 feet as in the previous examples. Portion included a solid 410 stainless steel conductor with an outside diameter of 1.25 . Portion included a solid 410 stainless steel conductor with 9 by weight cobalt added. The Curie temperature of portion is 230 F. higher than the Curie temperature of portion .

In some in situ conversion embodiments a downhole gas turbine is used to provide a portion of the electricity for an electric heater. The exhaust from the gas turbine may heat the formation. The heater may be a temperature limited heater in a horizontal section of a U shaped well. In some embodiments the substantially horizontal section of the U shaped well is over 1000 m long over 1300 m long over 1600 m long or over 1900 m long.

Electricity provided by electrical generator is directed to temperature limited heater through lead in conductors . Lead in conductors may be insulated conductors. If electrical generator is not able to supply enough electricity to temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbon layer to a desired temperature additional electricity may be supplied to the temperature limited heater through a conductor placed in inlet leg and electrically coupled to the temperature limited heater.

Exhaust gas from gas turbine passes through tubular to outlet . In an embodiment the tubular is 4 stainless steel pipe placed in a 6 wellbore. The exhaust gases heat an initial section of hydrocarbon layer before the gases become too cool to heat the hydrocarbon layer to the desired temperature. Temperature limited heater begins a selected distance from gas turbine . The distance may be 200 m 150 m 100 m or less. Heat provided to the portion of the formation from gas turbine to temperature limited heater may come from the exhaust gases passing through tubular . Temperature limited heater which is at least partially supplied with electricity generated by gas turbine heats hydrocarbon layer and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine. Temperature limited heater may be an insulated conductor heater with a self limiting temperature of about 760 C. In some embodiments temperature limited heater is placed in tubular . In other embodiments the temperature limited heater is on the outside of the tubular. Temperature limited heater may end at a selected horizontal distance from the outlet of the temperature limited heater. The distance may be 200 m 150 m 100 m or less. The exhaust gases heated by temperature limited heater transfer heat to hydrocarbon layer before passing through overburden to outlet .

Inlets and outlets of the U shaped wells for heating a portion of the formation may be placed in alternating directions in adjacent wells. Alternating inlets and outlets of the U shaped wells may allow for uniform heating of the hydrocarbon layer of the formation.

In some embodiments a portion of oxidant for gas turbine is routed to the gas turbine from outlet of an adjacent U shaped well. The portion of oxidant may be sent to the gas turbine through a separate line. Using oxidant from the exit of the adjacent well may allow some of the oxidant and or heat from the exiting exhaust gases to be recovered and utilized. The separate exhaust gas line to the gas turbine may transfer heat to the main oxidant line and or fuel line to the gas turbine.

Compressors and partial expanders may be located at the surface. Compressed fuel lines and oxidant lines extend to gas turbine . Generators burners and expanders of the gas turbine may be located at or near the transition between the overburden and the hydrocarbon layer that is to be heated. Locating equipment in this manner may reduce the complexity of the downhole equipment and reduce pressure drops for the oxidant going down the wellbore and the combustion gases going through the heater sections and back to the surface. The surface expander for a first well can expand gases from an adjacent well outlet since the adjacent well outlet is physically closer to the inlet of the first well than is the outlet of the first well. Moving compressed fuel and compressed oxidant down to the gas turbine may result in less pressure drop as compared to having cool fuel and oxidant travel down to the gas turbine. Placing gas turbine at or near the transition between overburden and hydrocarbon layer allows exhaust gas from the gas turbine to heat portions of the formation that are to be pyrolyzed. Placing the gas turbine at or near the transition between overburden and hydrocarbon layer may eliminate or reduce the amount of insulation needed between the overburden and inlet leg . In some embodiments tapered insulation may be applied at the exit of gas turbine to reduce excess heating of the formation near the gas turbine.

In some in situ conversion process embodiments a circulation system is used to heat the formation. The circulation system may be a closed loop circulation system. depicts a schematic representation of a system for heating a formation using a circulation system. The system may be used to heat hydrocarbons that are relatively deep in the ground and that are in formations that are relatively large in extent. In some embodiments the hydrocarbons may be 100 m 200 m 300 m or more below the surface. The circulation system may also be used to heat hydrocarbons that are not as deep in the ground. The hydrocarbons may be in formations that extend lengthwise up to 500 m 750 m 1000 m or more. The circulation system may become economically viable in formations where the length of the hydrocarbon containing formation to be treated is long compared to the thickness of the overburden. The ratio of the hydrocarbon formation extent to be heated by heaters to the overburden thickness may be at least 3 at least 5 or at least 10. The heaters of the circulation system may be positioned relative to adjacent heaters so that superposition of heat between heaters of the circulation system allows the temperature of the formation to be raised at least above the boiling point of aqueous formation fluid in the formation.

In some embodiments heaters may be formed in the formation by drilling a first wellbore and then drilling a second wellbore that connects with the first wellbore. Piping may be positioned in the U shaped wellbore to form U shaped heater . Heaters are connected to heat transfer fluid circulation system by piping. Gas at high pressure may be used as the heat transfer fluid in the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is chemically stable at the required temperatures and pressures and has a relatively high molecular weight that results in a high volumetric heat capacity. Other fluids such as steam air helium and or nitrogen may also be used. The pressure of the heat transfer fluid entering the formation may be 3000 kPa or higher. The use of high pressure heat transfer fluid allows the heat transfer fluid to have a greater density and therefore a greater capacity to transfer heat. Also the pressure drop across the heaters is less for a system where the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a first pressure for a given mass flow rate than when the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a second pressure at the same mass flow rate when the first pressure is greater than the second pressure.

Heat transfer fluid circulation system may include heat supply first heat exchanger second heat exchanger and compressor . Heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a high temperature. Heat supply may be a furnace solar collector reactor fuel cell exhaust heat or other high temperature source able to supply heat to the heat transfer fluid. In the embodiment depicted in heat supply is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature in a range from about 700 C. to about 920 C. from about 770 C. to about 870 C. or from about 800 C. to about 850 C. In an embodiment heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 820 C. The heat transfer fluid flows from heat supply to heaters . Heat transfers from heaters to formation adjacent to the heaters. The temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation may be in a range from about 350 C. to about 580 C. from about 400 C. to about 530 C. or from about 450 C. to about 500 C. In an embodiment the temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation is about 480 C. The metallurgy of the piping used to form heat transfer fluid circulation system may be varied to significantly reduce costs of the piping. High temperature steel may be used from heat supply to a point where the temperature is sufficiently low so that less expensive steel can be used from that point to first heat exchanger . Several different steel grades may be used to form the piping of heat transfer fluid circulation system .

Heat transfer fluid from heat supply of heat transfer fluid circulation system passes through overburden of formation to hydrocarbon layer . Portions of heaters extending through overburden may be insulated. In some embodiments the insulation or part of the insulation is a polyimide insulating material. Inlet portions of heaters in hydrocarbon layer may have tapering insulation to reduce overheating of the hydrocarbon layer near the inlet of the heater into the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments the diameter of the pipe in overburden may be smaller than the diameter of pipe through hydrocarbon layer . The smaller diameter pipe through overburden may allow for less heat transfer to the overburden. Reducing the amount of heat transfer to overburden reduces the amount of cooling of the heat transfer fluid supplied to pipe adjacent to hydrocarbon layer . The increased heat transfer in the smaller diameter pipe due to increased velocity of heat transfer fluid through the small diameter pipe is offset by the smaller surface area of the smaller diameter pipe and the decrease in residence time of the heat transfer fluid in the smaller diameter pipe.

After exiting formation the heat transfer fluid passes through first heat exchanger and second heat exchanger to compressor . First heat exchanger transfers heat between heat transfer fluid exiting formation and heat transfer fluid exiting compressor to raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid that enters heat supply and reduce the temperature of the fluid exiting formation . Second heat exchanger further reduces the temperature of the heat transfer fluid before the heat transfer fluid enters compressor .

The circulation system may be used to heat a portion of the formation. Production wells in the formation are used to remove produced fluids. After production from the formation has ended the circulation system may be used to recover heat from the formation. Heat transfer fluid may be circulated through heaters after heat supply depicted in is disconnected from the circulation system. The heat transfer fluid may be a different heat transfer fluid than the heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation. Heat transfers from the heated formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may be used to heat another portion of the formation or the heat transfer fluid may be used for other purposes. In some embodiments water is introduced into heaters to produce steam. In some embodiments low temperature steam is introduced into heaters so that the passage of the steam through the heaters increases the temperature of the steam. Other heat transfer fluids including natural or synthetic oils such as Syltherm oil Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. U.S.A. may be used instead of steam or water.

In some embodiments the circulation system may be used in conjunction with electrical heating. In some embodiments at least a portion of the pipe in the U shaped wellbores adjacent to portions of the formation that are to be heated is made of a ferromagnetic material. For example the piping adjacent to a layer or layers of the formation to be heated is made of a 9 to 13 chromium steel such as 410 stainless steel. The pipe may be a temperature limited heater when time varying electric current is applied to the piping. The time varying electric current may resistively heat the piping which heats the formation. In some embodiments direct electric current may be used to resistively heat the piping which heats the formation.

In some embodiments the circulation system is used to heat the formation to a first temperature and electrical energy is used to maintain the temperature of the formation and or heat the formation to higher temperatures. The first temperature may be sufficient to vaporize aqueous formation fluid in the formation. The first temperature may be at most about 200 C. at most about 300 C. at most about 350 C. or at most about 400 C. Using the circulation system to heat the formation to the first temperature allows the formation to be dry when electricity is used to heat the formation. Heating the dry formation may minimize electrical current leakage into the formation.

In some embodiments the circulation system and electrical heating may be used to heat the formation to a first temperature. The formation may be maintained or the temperature of the formation may be increased from the first temperature using the circulation system and or electrical heating. In some embodiments the formation may be raised to the first temperature using electrical heating and the temperature may be maintained and or increased using the circulation system. Economic factors available electricity availability of fuel for heating the heat transfer fluid and other factors may be used to determine when electrical heating and or circulation system heating are to be used.

In certain embodiments the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer is coupled to lead in conductors. Lead in conductors may be located in overburden . Lead in conductors may electrically couple the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer to one or more wellheads at the surface. Electrical isolators may be located at a junction of the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer with portions of heater in overburden so that the portions of the heater in the overburden are electrically isolated from the portion of the heater in the hydrocarbon layer. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are placed inside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are positioned outside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are insulated conductors with mineral insulation such as magnesium oxide. The lead in conductors may include highly electrically conductive materials such as copper or aluminum to reduce heat losses in overburden during electrical heating.

In certain embodiments the portions of heater in overburden may be used as lead in conductors. The portions of heater in overburden may be electrically coupled to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments one or more electrically conducting materials such as copper or aluminum are coupled for example cladded or welded to the portions of heater in overburden to reduce the electrical resistance of the portions of the heater in the overburden. Reducing the electrical resistance of the portions of heater in overburden reduces heat losses in the overburden during electrical heating.

In some embodiments the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer is a temperature limited heater with a self limiting temperature between about 600 C. and about 1000 C. The portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be a 9 to 13 chromium stainless steel. For example portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be 410 stainless steel. Time varying current may be applied to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer so that the heater operates as a temperature limited heater.

Electrical power supply system may include transformer and cables . In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. . Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and or reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer to the heaters.

Alternative energy sources may be used to supply electricity for subsurface electric heaters. Alternative energy sources include but are not limited to wind off peak power hydroelectric power geothermal solar and tidal wave action. Some of these alternative energy sources provide intermittent time variable power or power variable power. To provide power for subsurface electric heaters power provided by these alternative energy sources may be conditioned to produce power with appropriate operating parameters for example voltage frequency and or current for the subsurface heaters.

In some embodiments gas turbine is used to generate electricity to power heaters . Windmill and or gas turbine may be coupled to transformer . Transformer may convert power from windmill and or gas turbine into electrical power with appropriate operating parameters for heaters for example AC or DC power with appropriate voltage current and or frequency may be generated by the transformer .

In certain embodiments tap controller is coupled to transformer control system and heaters . Tap controller may monitor and control transformer to maintain a constant voltage to heaters regardless of the load of the heaters. Tap controller may control power output in a range from 5 MVA megavolt amps to 500 MVA from 10 MVA to 400 MVA or from 20 MVA to 300 MVA. As an example during operation an overload of voltage may be sent from transformer . Tap controller may distribute the excess load to other heaters and or other equipment in need of power. In some embodiments tap controller may store the excess load for future use.

Control system may control tap controller . Control system may be for example a computer controller or an analog logic system. Control system may use data supplied from power sensors to generate predictive algorithms and or control tap controller . For example data may be an amount of power generated from windmill gas turbine and or transformer . Data may also include an amount of resistive load of heaters .

Automatic voltage regulation for resistive load of a heater maintains the life of the heaters and or allows constant heat output from the heaters to a subsurface formation. Adjusting the load demands instead of adjusting the power source allows enhanced control of power supplied to heaters and or other equipment that requires electricity. Power supplied to heaters may be controlled within selected limits for example a power supplied and or controlled to a heater within 1 5 10 or 20 of power required by the heater . Control of power supplied from alternative energy sources may allow output of prime power at its rating allow energy produced for example from an intermittent source a subsurface formation or a hydroelectric source to be stored and used later and or allow use of power generated by intermittent power sources to be used as a constant source of energy.

Some hydrocarbon containing formations such as oil shale formations may include nahcolite trona dawsonite and or other minerals within the formation. In some embodiments nahcolite is contained in unleached portions of the formation. Unleached portions of the formation are parts of the formation where minerals are not removed by groundwater in the formation. For example in the Piceance basin in Colorado unleached oil shale is found below a depth of about 500 m below grade. Deep unleached oil shale formations in the Piceance basin center tend to be relatively rich in hydrocarbons. For example about 0.10 liters to about 0.15 liters of oil per kilogram L kg of oil shale may be producible from an unleached oil shale formation.

Nahcolite is a mineral that includes sodium bicarbonate NaHCO . Nahcolite may be found in formations in the Green River lakebeds in Colorado U.S.A. In some embodiments at least about 5 weight at least about 10 weight or at least about 20 weight nahcolite may be present in the formation. Dawsonite is a mineral that includes sodium aluminum carbonate NaAl CO OH . Dawsonite is typically present in the formation at weight percents greater than about 2 weight or in some embodiments greater than about 5 weight . Nahcolite and or dawsonite may dissociate at temperatures used in the in situ conversion process. The dissociation is strongly endothermic and may produce large amounts of carbon dioxide.

Nahcolite and or dawsonite may be solution mined prior to during and or following treatment of the formation in situ to avoid dissociation reactions and or to obtain desired chemical compounds. In certain embodiments hot water or steam is used to dissolve nahcolite in situ to form an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution before the in situ conversion process is used to process hydrocarbons in the formation. Nahcolite may form sodium ions Na and bicarbonate ions HCO in aqueous solution. The solution may be produced from the formation through production wells thus avoiding dissociation reactions during the in situ conversion process. In some embodiments dawsonite is thermally decomposed to alumina during the in situ conversion process for treating hydrocarbons in the formation. The alumina is solution mined after completion of the in situ conversion process.

Formations that include nahcolite and or dawsonite may be treated using the in situ conversion process. A perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of water into the treatment area. During solution mining and or the in situ conversion process the perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of dissolved minerals and formation fluid from the treatment area. During initial heating a portion of the formation to be treated may be raised to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite. The first temperature may be at most about 90 C. or in some embodiments at most about 80 C. The first temperature may be any temperature that increases the solvation rate of nahcolite in water but is also below a temperature at which nahcolite dissociates above about 95 C. at atmospheric pressure .

A first fluid may be injected into the heated portion. The first fluid may include water brine steam or other fluids that form a solution with nahcolite and or dawsonite. The first fluid may be at an increased temperature for example about 90 C. about 95 C. or about 100 C. The increased temperature may be similar to the first temperature of the portion of the formation.

In some embodiments the first fluid is injected at an increased temperature into a portion of the formation that has not been heated by heat sources. The increased temperature may be a temperature below a boiling point of the first fluid for example about 90 C. for water. Providing the first fluid at an increased temperature increases a temperature of a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments additional heat may be provided from one or more heat sources in the formation after the first fluid is injected.

In other embodiments the first fluid is or includes steam. The steam may be produced by forming steam in a previously heated portion of the formation for example by passing water through conduits that have been used to heat the formation by heat exchange with fluids produced from the formation and or by generating steam in standard steam production facilities.

In some embodiments heat from a hot previously treated portion of the formation is used to heat water brine and or steam used for solution mining a new portion of the formation. Heat transfer fluid may be introduced into the hot previously treated portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be water steam carbon dioxide or other fluids. Heat may transfer from the hot formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is produced from the formation through production wells. The heat transfer fluid is sent to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger may heat water brine and or steam used as the first fluid to solution mine the new portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be reintroduced into the heated portion of the formation to produce additional hot heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments heat transfer fluid produced from the formation is treated to remove hydrocarbons or other materials before being reintroduced into the formation as part of a remediation process of the heated portion of the formation.

Steam injected for solution mining may have a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. Injected steam may be at a temperature below 250 C. below 300 C. or below 400 C. The injected steam may be at a temperature of at least 150 C. at least 135 C. or at least 125 C. Injecting steam at pyrolysis temperatures may cause problems as hydrocarbons pyrolyze and hydrocarbon fines mix with the steam. The mixture of fines and steam may reduce permeability and or cause plugging of production wells and the formation. Thus the injected steam temperature is selected to inhibit plugging of the formation and or wells in the formation. The temperature of the injected steam may be varied during the solution mining process. As the solution mining progresses and the nahcolite being solution mined is farther away from the injection point the steam temperature may be increased so that steam and or water that reaches the nahcolite to be solution mined is at an elevated temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite.

A second fluid may be produced from the formation following injection of the first fluid into the formation. The second fluid may include products of the injected first fluid in the formation. For example the second fluid may include carbonic acid or other hydrated carbonate compounds formed from the dissolution of nahcolite in the first fluid. The second fluid may also include minerals and or metals. The minerals and or metals may include sodium aluminum phosphorus and other elements. Producing the second fluid from the formation may reduce the amount of energy required to heat the formation by removing mass and by removing minerals that would otherwise undergo endothermic reactions.

Solution mining the formation before the in situ conversion process allows initial heating of the formation to be provided by heat transfer from the first fluid used during solution mining. Solution mining nahcolite or other minerals that decompose or dissociate by means of endothermic reactions before the in situ conversion process avoids having energy supplied to heat the formation being used to support these endothermic reactions. Solution mining allows for production of minerals with commercial value. Removing nahcolite or other minerals before the in situ conversion process removes mass from the formation. Thus less mass is present in the formation that needs to be heated to higher temperatures and heating the formation to higher temperatures may be achieved more quickly and or more efficiently. Removing mass from the formation also may increase the permeability of the formation. Increasing the permeability may reduce the number of production wells needed for the in situ conversion process. In certain embodiments solution mining before the in situ conversion process reduces the time delay between startup of heating of the formation and production of hydrocarbons by two years or more.

Water inside treatment area may be pumped out of the treatment area through injection wells and or production wells . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as production wells and vice versa the wells are used as both an injection well and a production well . Water may be pumped out until a production rate of water is low or stops.

Heat may be provided to treatment area through heater wells . In some embodiments treatment area is heated to a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In certain embodiments heat is provided to treatment area from the first fluid injected into the formation. The first fluid may be injected at a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In some embodiments heater wells are installed in treatment area after the treatment area is solution mined. In some embodiments some heat is provided from heaters placed in injection wells and or production wells . A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heater wells .

The first fluid is injected through one or more injection wells . In some embodiments the first fluid is hot water. The first fluid may mix and or combine with non hydrocarbon material that is soluble in the first fluid such as nahcolite to produce a second fluid. The second fluid may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heater wells . Injection wells production wells and or heater wells may be heated during removal of the second fluid. Heating one or more wells during removal of the second fluid may maintain the temperature of the fluid during removal of the fluid from the treatment area above a desired value. After producing a majority of the soluble non hydrocarbon material from treatment area solution remaining within the treatment area may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heater wells . Removing the soluble non hydrocarbon material may produce a relatively high permeability treatment area .

Hydrocarbons within treatment area may be pyrolyzed and or produced using the in situ conversion process following removal of the soluble non hydrocarbon materials. The relatively high permeability treatment area allows for easy movement of hydrocarbon fluids in the formation during in situ conversion processing. The relatively high permeability treatment area provides an enhanced collection area for pyrolyzed and mobilized fluids in the formation. During the in situ conversion process heat may be provided to treatment area through heater wells . A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation through production wells and or heater wells . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as either production wells and or heater wells during the in situ conversion process.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided to treatment area at or near heater wells when a temperature in the formation is above a temperature sufficient to support oxidation of hydrocarbons. At such a temperature the oxidant reacts with the hydrocarbons to provide heat in addition to heat provided by electrical heaters in heater wells . The controlled amount of oxidant may facilitate oxidation of hydrocarbons in the formation to provide additional heat for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons in the formation. The oxidant may more easily flow through treatment area because of the increased permeability of the treatment area after removal of the non hydrocarbon materials. The oxidant may be provided in a controlled manner to control the heating of the formation. The amount of oxidant provided is controlled so that uncontrolled heating of the formation is avoided.

Following the in situ conversion process treatment area may be cooled by introducing water to produce steam from the hot portion of the formation. Introduction of water to produce steam may vaporize some hydrocarbons remaining in the formation. Water may be injected through injection wells . The injected water may cool the formation. The remaining hydrocarbons and generated steam may be produced through production wells and or heater wells . Treatment area may be cooled to a temperature near the boiling point of water. The steam produced from the formation may be used to heat a first fluid used to solution mine another portion of the formation.

Treatment area may be further cooled to a temperature at which water will condense in the formation. Water and or solvent may be introduced into and be removed from the treatment area. Removing the condensed water and or solvent from treatment area may remove any additional soluble material remaining in the treatment area. The water and or solvent may entrain non soluble fluid present in the formation. Fluid may be pumped out of treatment area through production well and or heater wells . The injection and removal of water and or solvent may be repeated until a desired water quality within treatment area is achieved. Water quality may be measured at injection wells heater wells and or production wells . The water quality may substantially match or exceed the water quality of treatment area prior to treatment.

In some embodiments treatment area may include a leached zone located above an unleached zone. The leached zone may have been leached naturally and or by a separate leaching process. In certain embodiments the unleached zone may be at a depth of at least about 500 m. A thickness of the unleached zone may be between about 100 m and about 500 m. However the depth and thickness of the unleached zone may vary depending on for example a location of treatment area and or the type of formation. In certain embodiments the first fluid is injected into the unleached zone below the leached zone. Heat may also be provided into the unleached zone.

In certain embodiments a section of a formation may be left untreated by solution mining and or unleached. The unleached section may be proximate a selected section of the formation that has been leached and or solution mined by providing the first fluid as described above. The unleached section may inhibit the flow of water into the selected section. In some embodiments more than one unleached section may be proximate a selected section.

Nahcolite may be present in the formation in layers or beds. In certain embodiments solution mining layered or bedded nahcolite from the formation causes vertical shifting in the formation. depicts an embodiment of a formation with nahcolite layers in the formation before solution mining nahcolite from the formation . Hydrocarbon layers A have substantially no nahcolite and hydrocarbon layers B have nahcolite. depicts the formation of after the nahcolite has been solution mined. Layers B have collapsed due to the removal of the nahcolite from the layers. The collapsing of layers B causes compaction of the layers and vertical shifting of the formation. The richness of layers B is increased after compaction of the layers. In addition the permeability of layers B may remain relatively high after compaction due to removal of the nahcolite. Heater wells may be placed in the formation after removal of nahcolite and the subsequent vertical shifting. Forming heater wellbores and or installing heaters in the formation after the vertical shifting protects the heaters from being damaged due to the vertical shifting.

In certain embodiments removing nahcolite from the formation interconnects two or more wells in the formation. Removing nahcolite from zones in the formation may increase the permeability in the zones. Some zones may have more nahcolite than others and become more permeable as the nahcolite is removed. At a certain time zones with the increased permeability may interconnect two or more wells for example injection wells or production wells in the formation.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate may be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries in leather tanning in fire retardation in wastewater treatment and in flue gas treatment flue gas desulphurization and hydrogen chloride reduction . The second fluid may be kept pressurized and at an elevated temperature when removed from the formation. The second fluid may be cooled in a crystallizer to precipitate sodium bicarbonate.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate may be used in the manufacture of glass in the manufacture of detergents in water purification polymer production tanning paper manufacturing effluent neutralization metal refining sugar extraction and or cement manufacturing. The second fluid removed from the formation may be heated in a treatment facility to form sodium carbonate soda ash and or sodium carbonate brine. Heating sodium bicarbonate will form sodium carbonate according to the equation 2NaHCO NaCO CO HO.

In certain embodiments the heat for heating the sodium bicarbonate is provided using heat from the formation. For example a heat exchanger that uses steam produced from the water introduced into the hot formation may be used to heat the second fluid to dissociation temperatures of the sodium bicarbonate. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through the formation to utilize heat in the formation for further reaction. Steam and or hot water may also be added to facilitate circulation. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through conduits previously used to heat the formation.

In some embodiments higher temperatures are used in the formation for example above about 120 C. above about 130 C. above about 150 C. or below about 250 C. during solution mining of nahcolite. The first fluid is introduced into the formation under pressure sufficient to inhibit sodium bicarbonate from dissociating to produce carbon dioxide. The pressure in the formation may be maintained at sufficiently high pressures to inhibit such nahcolite dissociation but below pressures that would result in fracturing the formation. In addition the pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to inhibit steam formation if hot water is being introduced in the formation. In some embodiments a portion of the nahcolite may begin to decompose in situ. In such cases nahcolite is removed from the formation as soda ash. If soda ash is produced from solution mining of nahcolite the soda ash may be transported to a separate facility for treatment. The soda ash may be transported through a pipeline to the separate facility.

As described above in certain embodiments following removal of nahcolite from the formation the formation is treated using the in situ conversion process to produce formation fluids from the formation. If dawsonite is present in the formation dawsonite within the heated portion of the formation decomposes during heating of the formation to pyrolysis temperature. Dawsonite typically decomposes at temperatures above 270 C. according to the reaction 2NaAl OH CO NaCO AlO 2HO CO.

In certain embodiments alumina formed by dawsonite decomposition is solution mined using a chelating agent. The chelating agent may be injected through injection wells production wells and or heater wells used for solution mining nahcolite and or the in situ conversion process for example injection wells production wells and or heater wells depicted in . The chelating agent may be an aqueous acid. In certain embodiments the chelating agent is EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid . Other examples of possible chelating agents include but are not limited to ethylenediamine porphyrins dimercaprol nitrilotriacetic acid diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid phosphoric acids acetic acid acetoxy benzoic acids nicotinic acid pyruvic acid citric acid tartaric acid malonic acid imidizole ascorbic acid phenols hydroxy ketones sebacic acid and boric acid. The mixture of chelating agent and alumina may be produced through production wells or other wells used for solution mining and or the in situ conversion process for example injection wells production wells and or heater wells which are depicted in . The alumina may be separated from the chelating agent in a treatment facility. The recovered chelating agent may be recirculated back to the formation to solution mine more alumina.

In some embodiments alumina within the formation may be solution mined using a basic fluid after the in situ conversion process. Basic fluids include but are not limited to sodium hydroxide ammonia magnesium hydroxide magnesium carbonate sodium carbonate potassium carbonate pyridine and amines. In an embodiment sodium carbonate brine such as 0.5 Normal NaCO is used to solution mine alumina. Sodium carbonate brine may be obtained from solution mining nahcolite from the formation. Obtaining the basic fluid by solution mining the nahcolite may significantly reduce costs associated with obtaining the basic fluid. The basic fluid may be injected into the formation through a heater well and or an injection well. The basic fluid may combine with alumina to form an alumina solution that is removed from the formation. The alumina solution may be removed through a heater well injection well or production well.

Alumina may be extracted from the alumina solution in a treatment facility. In an embodiment carbon dioxide is bubbled through the alumina solution to precipitate the alumina from the basic fluid. Carbon dioxide may be obtained from dissociation of nahcolite from the in situ conversion process or from decomposition of the dawsonite during the in situ conversion process.

In certain embodiments a formation may include portions that are significantly rich in either nahcolite or dawsonite only. For example a formation may contain significant amounts of nahcolite for example at least about 20 weight at least about 30 weight or at least about 40 weight in a depocenter of the formation. The depocenter may contain only about 5 weight or less dawsonite on average. However in bottom layers of the formation a weight percent of dawsonite may be about 10 weight or even as high as about 25 weight . In such formations it may be advantageous to solution mine for nahcolite only in nahcolite rich areas such as the depocenter and solution mine for dawsonite only in the dawsonite rich areas such as the bottom layers. This selective solution mining may significantly reduce fluid costs heating costs and or equipment costs associated with operating the solution mining process.

In certain formations dawsonite composition varies between layers in the formation. For example some layers of the formation may have dawsonite and some layers may not. In certain embodiments more heat is provided to layers with more dawsonite than to layers with less dawsonite. Tailoring heat input to provide more heat to certain dawsonite layers more uniformly heats the formation as the reaction to decompose dawsonite absorbs some of the heat intended for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. depicts an embodiment for heating a formation with dawsonite in the formation. Hydrocarbon layer may be cored to assess the dawsonite composition of the hydrocarbon layer. The mineral composition may be assessed using for example FTIR Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or x ray diffraction. Assessing the core composition may also assess the nahcolite composition of the core. After assessing the dawsonite composition heater may be placed in wellbore . Heater includes sections to provide more heat to hydrocarbon layers with more dawsonite in the layers hydrocarbon layers D . Hydrocarbon layers with less dawsonite hydrocarbon layers C are provided with less heat by heater . Heat output of heater may be tailored by for example adjusting the resistance of the heater along the length of the heater. In one embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater described herein that has a higher temperature limit for example higher Curie temperature in sections proximate layers D as compared to the temperature limit Curie temperature of sections proximate layers C. The resistance of heater may also be adjusted by altering the resistive conducting materials along the length of the heater to supply a higher energy input watts per meter adjacent to dawsonite rich layers.

Solution mining dawsonite and nahcolite may be relatively simple processes that produce aluminum and soda ash from the formation. In some embodiments hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ conversion process may be fuel for a power plant that produces direct current DC electricity at or near the site of the in situ conversion operation. The produced DC electricity may be used on the site to produce aluminum metal from the alumina using the Hall process. Aluminum metal may be produced from the alumina by melting the alumina in a treatment facility on the site. Generating the DC electricity at the site may save on costs associated with using hydrotreaters pipelines or other treatment facilities associated with transporting and or treating hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ conversion process.

In some embodiments a perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be a frozen barrier and or a grout barrier. After formation of the perimeter barrier the treatment area may be processed to produce desired products.

Formations that include non hydrocarbon materials may be treated to remove and or dissolve a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials from a section of the formation before hydrocarbons are produced from the section. In some embodiments the non hydrocarbon materials are removed by solution mining. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may reduce the carbon dioxide generation sources present in the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may increase the porosity and or permeability of the section of the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may result in a raised temperature in the section of the formation.

After solution mining some of the wells in the treatment may be converted to heater wells injection wells and or production wells. In some embodiments additional wells are formed in the treatment area. The wells may be heater wells injection wells and or production wells. Logging techniques may be employed to assess the physical characteristics including any vertical shifting resulting from the solution mining and or the composition of material in the formation. Packing baffles or other techniques may be used to inhibit formation fluid from entering the heater wells. The heater wells may be activated to heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to support combustion.

One or more production wells may be positioned in permeable sections of the treatment area. Production wells may be horizontally and or vertically oriented. For example production wells may be positioned in areas of the formation that have a permeability of greater than 5 darcy or 10 darcy. In some embodiments production wells may be positioned near a perimeter barrier. A production well may allow water and production fluids to be removed from the formation. Positioning the production well near a perimeter barrier enhances the flow of fluids from the warmer zones of the formation to the cooler zones.

Heat may be provided to treatment area through heaters positioned in injection wells . In some embodiments the heaters in injection wells heat formation adjacent to the injections wells to temperatures sufficient to support combustion. Heaters in injection wells may raise the formation near the injection wells to temperatures from about 90 C. to about 120 C. or higher for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. .

Injection wells may be used to introduce a combustion fuel an oxidant steam and or a heat transfer fluid into treatment area either before during or after heat is provided to the treatment area from heaters. In some embodiments injection wells are in communication with each other to allow the introduced fluid to flow from one well to another. Injection wells may be located at positions that are relatively far away from perimeter barrier . Introduced fluid may cause combustion of hydrocarbons in treatment area . Heat from the combustion may heat treatment area and mobilize fluids toward production wells .

A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heater wells.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided in injection wells to advance a heat front towards production wells . The amount of oxidant is controlled to limit the advancement rate of the heat front and to limit the temperature of the heat front. The advancing heat front may pyrolyze hydrocarbons. The high permeability in the formation allows the pyrolyzed hydrocarbons to spread in the formation towards production wells without being overtaken by the advancing heat front.

Vaporized formation fluid and or gas formed during the combustion process may be removed through gas wells and or injection well . Venting of gases through the gas wells and or the injection well may force the combustion front in a desired direction.

In some embodiments the formation may be heated to a temperature sufficient temperature to cause pyrolysis of the formation fluid by the steam and or heat transfer fluid. The steam and or heat transfer fluid may be heated to temperatures of about 300 C. about 400 C. about 500 C. or about 600 C. In certain embodiments the steam and or heat transfer fluid may be co injected with the fuel and or oxidant.

Carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be produced during in situ conversion processes and during many conventional production processes. Removal of hydrogen sulfide from produced formation fluid may reduce the toxicity and or strong odor in the produced formation fluid thus making the formation fluid more acceptable for transportation and or processing. Removing carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide from produced formation fluids may reduce capital costs associated with removing the fluids and reduce or eliminate the need for certain surface facilities for example a Claus plant or Scot gas treater . Since carbon dioxide has a low heating value removal of carbon dioxide from formation fluids may increase the heat capacity of a gas stream separated from the formation fluid.

Net release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and or hydrogen sulfide conversion to sulfur from an in situ conversion process for hydrocarbons may be reduced by utilizing the produced carbon dioxide and or by storing carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide within the formation or within another formation. In certain embodiments carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide is stored in a deep saline porous formation. The carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may promote mineralization within the formation. In certain embodiments carbon dioxide is stored at a depth in the formation such that the carbon dioxide is introduced in the formation in a supercritical state. The depths of outlets of insertion wells used to introduce carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide in the formation may be 900 m or more below the surface.

Injection of carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide into a non producing formation or using the carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide as a flood fluid is described by Caroll in Physical Properties Relevant to Acid Gas Injection Presented at the 14th International Gas Convention Venezuelan Gas Processors Association on May 10 12 2000 in Caracas Venezuela Phase Equilibria Relevant to Acid Gas Injection Part 1 Non Aqueoues Phase Behaviour Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology 2002 Vol. 41 No. 6 pp. 1 6 and Phase Equilibria Relevant to Acid Gas Injection Part 2 Aqueoues Phase Behaviour Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology 2002 Vol. 41 No. 7 pp. 1 5 all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

During production of formation fluids from a subsurface formation carbonic acid may be produced from the reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Portions of wells made of certain materials such as carbon steel may start to deteriorate e.g. corrode in the presence of the carbonic acid. To inhibit corrosion due to carbonic acid basic solutions and or solvents may be introduced in the wellbore to neutralize and or dissolve the carbonic acid.

In some embodiments hydrogen sulfide is introduced into one or more wellbores in a subsurface formation. Introduction of the hydrogen sulfide may be performed at pressures below the lithostatic pressure of the subsurface formation to inhibit fracturing the formation. The injected hydrogen sulfide may form a sulfide layer on metal surfaces of the well. Formation of a sulfide layer may inhibit corrosion of the metal surfaces of the well by carbonic acid.

In certain embodiments an electrical insulator for example a centralizer an insulating layer the electrical insulator in an insulated conductor heater or any other electrical insulator described herein includes a material that is fired or cured when heated in the subsurface. The material may develop desired dielectric or other electrical properties and or physical properties after the material is fired or cured in a wellbore in the formation. The material may be fired or cured when a heater is turned on in the wellbore and the heater heats the material to its firing or curing temperature.

An example of such a material is a ceramic tape available from Composite Development Technology Inc. Lafayette Colo. U.S.A. . The ceramic tape is flexible before it is fired. The ceramic tape obtains its dielectric properties after firing. After firing the ceramic tape is a hard ceramic with good dielectric properties suitable for subsurface electrical heating.

In an embodiment the ceramic tape is wrapped around an electrical conductor for example the conductor of a temperature limited heater . Electrical current may be applied to the electrical conductor to heat the heater and fire the ceramic tape. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is pre fired before installation of a heater. The ceramic tape may be pre fired using for example a hot gas gun.

Before firing the ceramic tape is flexible and easy to install in a variety of applications. In certain embodiments the ceramic tape is used between centralizers in a conductor in conduit heater. The ceramic tape may inhibit shorting of the conductor and conduit if the centralizers fail for example if the centralizers buckle and fail . In certain embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the centralizers in a conductor in conduit heater. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the electrical insulator in an insulated conductor heater. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the electrical insulator in splices between sections of heaters. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used to electrically insulate the legs of a three phase heater. The three legs of the three phase heater may be enclosed in one sheath with the ceramic tape separating the legs of the heater.
