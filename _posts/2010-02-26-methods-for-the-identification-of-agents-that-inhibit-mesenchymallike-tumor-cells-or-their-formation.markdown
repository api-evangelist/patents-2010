title: Methods for the identification of agents that inhibit mesenchymal-like tumor cells or their formation
abstract: The present invention provides tumor cell preparations for use as models of the EMT process for use in the identification of anti-cancer agents, wherein said tumor cell preparations comprise cells of the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC-1, which are stimulated by receptor ligands to induce EMT, or which have been engineered to inducibly express a protein that stimulates EMT. The present invention also provides methods of identifying potential anti-cancer agents by using such tumor cell preparations to identify agents that inhibit EMT, stimulate MET, or inhibit the growth of mesenchymal-like cells. Such agents should be particularly useful when used in conjunction with other anti-cancer drugs such as EGFR and IGF-1R kinase inhibitors, which appear to be less effective at inhibiting tumor cells that have undergone an EMT.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 208 898 filed Feb. 27 2009 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention is directed to EMT cell models and methods for their use in the identification of new anti cancer agents for treating cancer patients particularly in combination with other agents such as EGFR or IGF 1R kinase inhibitors that can be less effective at inhibiting tumor cells that have undergone an EMT. Cancer is a generic name for a wide range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated growth lack of differentiation and the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. These neoplastic malignancies affect with various degrees of prevalence every tissue and organ in the body.

An anti neoplastic drug would ideally kill cancer cells selectively with a wide therapeutic index relative to its toxicity towards non malignant cells. It would also retain its efficacy against malignant cells even after prolonged exposure to the drug. Unfortunately none of the current chemotherapies possess such an ideal profile. Instead most possess very narrow therapeutic indexes. Furthermore cancerous cells exposed to slightly sub lethal concentrations of a chemotherapeutic agent will very often develop resistance to such an agent and quite often cross resistance to several other antineoplastic agents as well.

A multitude of therapeutic agents have been developed over the past few decades for the treatment of various types of cancer. The most commonly used types of anticancer agents include DNA alkylating agents e.g. cyclophosphamide ifosfamide antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate a folate antagonist and 5 fluorouracil a pyrimidine antagonist microtubule disrupters e.g. vincristine vinblastine paclitaxel DNA intercalators e.g. doxorubicin daunomycin cisplatin and hormone therapy e.g. tamoxifen flutamide . More recently gene targeted therapies such as protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors have increasingly been used in cancer therapy de Bono J. S. and Rowinsky E. K. 2002 Trends in Mol. Medicine. 8 S19 S26 Dancey J. and Sausville E. A. 2003 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 2 92 313 . Such approaches such as the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib are generally associated with reduced toxicity compared with conventional cytotoxic agents. They are therefore particularly appropriate for use in combination regimens. In pancreatic cancer phase III trials have shown that first line erlotinib treatment in combination with gemcitabine improves survival.

The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR family comprises four closely related receptors HER1 EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4 involved in cellular responses such as differentiation and proliferation. Over expression of the EGFR kinase or its ligand TGF alpha is frequently associated with many cancers including breast lung colorectal ovarian renal cell bladder head and neck cancers glioblastomas and astrocytomas and is believed to contribute to the malignant growth of these tumors. A specific deletion mutation in the EGFR gene EGFRvIII has also been found to increase cellular tumorigenicity. Activation of EGFR stimulated signaling pathways promote multiple processes that are potentially cancer promoting e.g. proliferation angiogenesis cell motility and invasion decreased apoptosis and induction of drug resistance. Increased HER1 EGFR expression is frequently linked to advanced disease metastases and poor prognosis. For example in NSCLC and gastric cancer increased HER1 EGFR expression has been shown to correlate with a high metastatic rate poor tumor differentiation and increased tumor proliferation.

Mutations which activate the receptor s intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and or increase downstream signaling have been observed in NSCLC and glioblastoma. However the role of mutations as a principle mechanism in conferring sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors for example erlotinib TARCEVA or gefitinib IRESSA has been controversial. Recently a mutant form of the full length EGF receptor has been reported to predict responsiveness to the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib Paez J. G. et al. 2004 Science 304 1497 1500 Lynch T. J. et al. 2004 N. Engl. J. Med. 350 2129 2139 . Cell culture studies have shown that cell lines which express the mutant form of the EGF receptor i.e. H3255 were more sensitive to growth inhibition by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and that much higher concentrations of gefitinib was required to inhibit the tumor cell lines expressing wild type EGF receptor. These observations suggests that specific mutant forms of the EGF receptor may reflect a greater sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors but do not identify a completely non responsive phenotype.

Erlotinib e.g. erlotinib HCl also known as TARCEVA or OSI 774 is an orally available inhibitor of EGFR kinase. In vitro erlotinib has demonstrated substantial inhibitory activity against EGFR kinase in many human tumor cell lines. In a phase III trial erlotinib monotherapy significantly prolonged survival delayed disease progression and delayed worsening of lung cancer related symptoms in patients with advanced treatment refractory NSCLC Shepherd F. et al. 2005 N. Engl. J. Med. 353 2 123 132 . In November 2004 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved TARCEVA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

The development for use as anti tumor agents of compounds that directly inhibit the kinase activity of IGF 1R as well as antibodies that reduce IGF 1R kinase activity by blocking IGF 1R activation or antisense oligonucleotides that block IGF 1R expression are also areas of intense research effort e.g. see Larsson O. et al 2005 Brit. J. Cancer 92 2097 2101 Ibrahim Y. H. and Yee D. 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 944s 950s Mitsiades C. S. et al. 2004 Cancer Cell 5 221 230 Camirand A. et al. 2005 Breast Cancer Research 7 R570 R579 DOI 10.1186 bcr1028 Camirand A. and Pollak M. 2004 Brit. J. Cancer 90 1825 1829 Garcia Echeverria C. et al. 2004 Cancer Cell 5 231 239 .

IGF 1R is a transmembrane RTK that binds primarily to IGF 1 but also to IGF II and insulin with lower affinity. Binding of IGF 1 to its receptor results in receptor oligomerization activation of tyrosine kinase intermolecular receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cellular substrates major substrates are IRS1 and Shc . The ligand activated IGF 1R induces mitogenic activity in normal cells and plays an important role in abnormal growth. A major physiological role of the IGF 1 system is the promotion of normal growth and regeneration. Overexpressed IGF 1R type 1 insulin like growth factor receptor can initiate mitogenesis and promote ligand dependent neoplastic transformation. Furthermore IGF 1R plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Unlike the epidermal growth factor EGF receptor no mutant oncogenic forms of the IGF 1R have been identified. However several oncogenes have been demonstrated to affect IGF 1 and IGF 1R expression. The correlation between a reduction of IGF 1R expression and resistance to transformation has been seen. Exposure of cells to the mRNA antisense to IGF 1R RNA prevents soft agar growth of several human tumor cell lines. IGF 1R abrogates progression into apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. It has also been shown that a decrease in the level of IGF 1R below wild type levels causes apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. The ability of IGF 1R disruption to cause apoptosis appears to be diminished in normal non tumorigenic cells.

The IGF 1 pathway in human tumor development has an important role. IGF 1R overexpression is frequently found in various tumors breast colon lung sarcoma and is often associated with an aggressive phenotype. High circulating IGF1 concentrations are strongly correlated with prostate lung and breast cancer risk. Furthermore IGF 1R is required for establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype in vitro and in vivo Baserga R. 1999 253 1 6 . The kinase activity of IGF 1R is essential for the transforming activity of several oncogenes EGFR PDGFR SV40 T antigen activated Ras Raf and v Src. The expression of IGF 1R in normal fibroblasts induces neoplastic phenotypes which can then form tumors in vivo. IGF 1R expression plays an important role in anchorage independent growth. IGF 1R has also been shown to protect cells from chemotherapy radiation and cytokine induced apoptosis. Conversely inhibition of endogenous IGF 1R by dominant negative IGF 1R triple helix formation or antisense expression vector has been shown to repress transforming activity in vitro and tumor growth in animal models.

During most cancer metastases an important change occurs in a tumor cell known as the epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT Thiery J. P. 2002 Nat. Rev. Cancer 2 442 454 Savagner P. 2001 Bioessays 23 912 923 Kang Y. and Massague J. 2004 Cell 118 277 279 Julien Grille S. et al. Cancer Research 63 2172 2178 Bates R. C. et al. 2003 Current Biology 13 1721 1727 Lu Z. et al. 2003 Cancer Cell. 4 6 499 515 . EMT does not occur in healthy cells except during embryogenesis. Epithelial cells which are bound together tightly and exhibit polarity give rise to mesenchymal cells which are held together more loosely exhibit a loss of polarity and have the ability to travel. These mesenchymal cells can spread into tissues surrounding the original tumor as well as separate from the tumor invade blood and lymph vessels and travel to new locations where they divide and form additional tumors. Recent research has demonstrated that epithelial cells respond well to EGFR and IGF 1R kinase inhibitors but that after an EMT the resulting mesenchymal like cells are much less sensitive to such inhibitors. e.g. Thompson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 U.S. Patent Application 60 997 514 . Thus there is a pressing need for anti cancer agents that can prevent or reverse tumor cell EMT events e.g. stimulate a mesenchymal to epithelial transition MET or inhibit the growth of the mesenchymal like tumor cells resulting from EMT. Such agents should be particularly useful when used in conjunction with other anti cancer drugs such as EGFR and IGF 1R kinase inhibitors.

As human cancers progress to a more invasive metastatic state multiple signaling programs regulating cell survival and migration programs are observed depending on cell and tissue contexts Gupta G. P. and Massague J. 2006 Cell 127 679 695 . Recent data highlight the transdifferentiation of epithelial cancer cells to a more mesenchymal like state a process resembling epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT Oft M. et al. 1996 . Genes development 10 2462 2477 Perl A. K. et al. 1998 .

Through EMT like transitions mesenchymal like tumor cells are thought to gain migratory capacity at the expense of proliferative potential. A mesenchymal epithelial transition MET has been postulated to regenerate a more proliferative state and allow macrometastases resembling the primary tumor to form at distant sites Thiery J. P. 2002 Nat Rev Cancer 2 442 454 . EMT like transitions in tumor cells result from transcriptional reprogramming over considerable periods of time weeks to months via transcription factors harboring zinc finger forkhead bHLH and HMG box domains Mani S. A. et al. 2007 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104 10069 10074 Peinado H. et al. 2007 Nat Rev Cancer 7 415 428 . The loss of E cadherin and transition to a more mesenchymal like state likely serves a major role in the progression of cancer Matsumura T. et al. 2001 Clin Cancer Res 7 594 599 Yoshiura K. et al. 1995 . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 92 7416 7419 and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype has been correlated with poor prognosis Baumgart E. et al. 2007 Clin Cancer Res 13 1685 1694 Kokkinos M. I. Et al. 2007 Cells tissues organs 185 191 203 Willipinski Stapelfeldt B. et al. 2005 Clin Cancer Res 11 8006 8014. . Targeting tumor derived and or tumor associated stromal cells provides a unique mechanism to block EMT like transitions and inhibit the survival of invading cells.

The cellular changes associated with EMT like transitions alter the dependence of carcinoma cells on EGF receptor signaling networks for survival. It has been observed that an EMT like transition was associated with cellular insensitivity to the EGFR TKI erlotinib Thomson S. et al. 2005 Cancer research 65 9455 9462 Witta S.

L. et al. 2005 Clin Cancer Res 11 8686 8698 . The molecular determinants to alternative routes of activation of the PI3 kinase and Erk pathways which can bypass cellular sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors have been actively investigated Chakravarti A. et al. 2002 Cancer research 62 200 207 Engelman J. A. et al. 2007 Science 316 1039 1043 .

Inhibition of EMT like transitions and mesenchymal like cell survival would be predicted to reduce tumor metastasis and progression. Current data suggest patients with metastasis have heterogeneous tumors that can contain cells with epithelial and mesenchymal like phenotypes. The observation that tumors can acquire new signaling pathways for example PDGFR and FGFR autocrine signaling suggest new therapeutic modalities to target specific tumor cell populations. These data suggest rational drug combinations that would not only cause growth inhibition or apoptosis of tumor cells directly but would also impact mesenchymal cell populations promoting cancer recurrence Moody S. E. et al. 2005 . Cancer cell 8 197 209 . Essential for the discovery and development of such drug combinations will be the availability of good cellular and animal models where their efficacy can be readily assessed. The invention described herein provides such models.

The term cancer in an animal refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer causing cells such as uncontrolled proliferation immortality metastatic potential rapid growth and proliferation rate and certain characteristic morphological features. Often cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor but such cells may exist alone within an animal or may circulate in the blood stream as independent cells such as leukemic cells.

 Cell growth as used herein for example in the context of tumor cell growth unless otherwise indicated is used as commonly used in oncology where the term is principally associated with growth in cell numbers which occurs by means of cell reproduction i.e. proliferation when the rate the latter is greater than the rate of cell death e.g. by apoptosis or necrosis to produce an increase in the size of a population of cells although a small component of that growth may in certain circumstances be due also to an increase in cell size or cytoplasmic volume of individual cells. An agent that inhibits cell growth can thus do so by either inhibiting proliferation or stimulating cell death or both such that the equilibrium between these two opposing processes is altered.

 Tumor growth or tumor metastases growth as used herein unless otherwise indicated is used as commonly used in oncology where the term is principally associated with an increased mass or volume of the tumor or tumor metastases primarily as a result of tumor cell growth.

 Abnormal cell growth as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to cell growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms e.g. loss of contact inhibition . This includes the abnormal growth of 1 tumor cells tumors that proliferate by expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase or over expression of a receptor tyrosine kinase 2 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant tyrosine kinase activation occurs 4 any tumors that proliferate by receptor tyrosine kinases 5 any tumors that proliferate by aberrant serine threonine kinase activation and 6 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant serine threonine kinase activation occurs.

The term treating as used herein unless otherwise indicated means reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of or preventing either partially or completely the growth of tumors tumor metastases or other cancer causing or neoplastic cells in a patient with cancer. The term treatment as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to the act of treating.

The phrase a method of treating or its equivalent when applied to for example cancer refers to a procedure or course of action that is designed to reduce or eliminate the number of cancer cells in an animal or to alleviate the symptoms of a cancer. A method of treating cancer or another proliferative disorder does not necessarily mean that the cancer cells or other disorder will in fact be eliminated that the number of cells or disorder will in fact be reduced or that the symptoms of a cancer or other disorder will in fact be alleviated. Often a method of treating cancer will be performed even with a low likelihood of success but which given the medical history and estimated survival expectancy of an animal is nevertheless deemed an overall beneficial course of action.

The term therapeutically effective agent means a composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The term therapeutically effective amount or effective amount means the amount of the subject compound or combination that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The present invention derives from research that provided methods for determining which tumors will respond most effectively to treatment with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors e.g. Thompson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 U.S. Patent Application 60 997 514 based on whether the tumor cells have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT Thiery J. P. 2002 Nat. Rev. Cancer 2 442 454 Savagner P. 2001 Bioessays 23 912 923 Kang Y. and Massague J. 2004 Cell 118 277 279 Julien Grille S. et al. Cancer Research 63 2172 2178 Bates R. C. et al. 2003 Current Biology 13 1721 1727 Lu Z. et al. 2003 Cancer Cell. 4 6 499 515 . This research demonstrated that epithelial cells respond well to EGFR and IGF 1R kinase inhibitors but that after an EMT the resulting mesenchymal like cells are much less sensitive to such inhibitors. Biomarkers can be used to determine whether tumor cells have undergone an EMT Thomson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 . As a result of such work it became apparent that new therapeutic approaches would be necessary to find agents that were capable of inhibiting the genesis growth and or function of such mesenchymal like cells which are thought to be an important element in the invasive and metastatic properties of tumors.

A considerable body of work is emerging that is beginning to delineate the biochemical pathways involved in regulating tumor EMT events and to characterize the resultant mesenchymal like tumor cells. For example experiments using specific siRNA inhibitors of the expression of various protein products produced by mesenchymal like tumor cells have demonstrated that reduced expression of the products of certain genes can specifically inhibit the growth of mesenchymal like tumor cells. Thus pharmacological agents that also specifically inhibit the expression of the protein products encoded by these genes or specifically inhibit the biological activity of the expressed proteins e.g. phosphotransferase activity such as specific antibodies to expressed proteins that possess an extracellular domain antisense molecules ribozymes or small molecule enzyme inhibitors e.g. protein kinase inhibitors are similarly expected to be agents that will also specifically inhibit the growth of mesenchymal like tumor cells. The anti tumor effects of a combination of an EGFR or IGF 1R kinase inhibitor with such an agent should be superior to the anti tumor effects of these kinase inhibitors by themselves since such a combination should effectively inhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal like tumor cells and thus co administration of such agents with EGFR or IGF 1R kinase inhibitors should be effective for treatment of patients with advanced cancers such as NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancers.

Given the identification of key targets for the discovery and development of agents that will inhibit the growth of mesenchymal like tumor cells or the EMT process there is thus a pressing need for models and methods to evaluate agents identified by in vitro screening methods e.g. using protein kinase assays to determine if they have the predicted effect of inhibiting the growth and or migration of mesenchymal like tumor cells both at a cellular level and in vivo. The data presented in the Examples herein demonstrates that the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 can be stimulated to undergo EMT by contacting it with one or more cell receptor ligands or by inducing the expression of one or more protein products capable of modulating the EMT process. Not all epithelial tumor cell lines can be stimulated to undergo EMT and the optimal process for EMT induction is cell line dependent. Thus CFPAC 1 tumor cells treated in various ways to induce EMT can be used as models both in vitro and vivo in methods to identify agents that can inhibit mesenchymal like tumor cells prevent their formation or reverse the EMT process. These methods are also useful in the identification of agents for the treatment of fibrotic disorders resulting in part from EMT transitions including but not limited to renal fibrosis hepatic fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis and mesotheliomas. Thus any of the inventions described herein as being applicable to tumor cells will also be applicable to other cell types involved in fibrotic diseases that undergo EMT. Similarly any of the inventions described herein as being useful for the identification of anti cancer agents will also be useful in the identification of anti fibrotic agents for treating diseases that involve fibrosis.

 CFPAC 1 cells as used herein refers to cells of the pancreatic epithelial cell line CFPAC 1 a.k.a. CRL 1918 available from the American Tissue Culture Collection ATCC as ATCC Number CRL 1918 derived from a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma liver metastasis from a patient with cystic fibrosis.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method of identifying an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition comprising contacting a sample of cells of the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 with a test agent to be screened contacting the sample with a single protein ligand preparation that induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells determining whether the test agent inhibits the tumor cells in the sample from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition by comparing the level of a biomarker whose level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells to the level of the same biomarker in an identical sample of CFPAC 1 cells not contacted with the test agent and thus determining whether the test agent is an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In one embodiment the single protein ligand that induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells is selected from OSM HGF BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF and BMP4.

A single protein ligand preparation as used herein means a preparation comprising a protein ligand for a cell receptor which ligand is capable by itself of substantially inducing EMT in CFPAC 1 cells as assessed for example by a significant decrease in expression of the epithelial biomarker E cadherin and or a significant increase in expression of the mesenchymal biomarker vimentin. A single protein ligand preparation may contain additional compounds or proteins e.g. cell nutrients other growth factors agents that stabilize the protein ligands etc. For example a single protein ligand preparation may be supplemented with one or more alternative single ligands that also induce EMT or a ligand that does not normally induce EMT on its own which may result in a slightly more complete EMT. By contrast with CFPAC 1 cells induction of EMT in other cells can sometimes require a dual protein ligand preparation i.e. a preparation comprising two protein ligands for different cell receptors which ligands are capable of inducing EMT in cells and where both ligands are required for EMT induction i.e. either ligand by itself does not substantially induce EMT e.g. EMT induction in H358 cells by HGF and OSM see U.S. provisional application 61 068 612 .

In any of the methods or cell preparations of the invention described herein the single protein ligand that induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells may be selected from any of the protein ligands that bind to and activate the receptors for OSM HGF BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF and BMP4 either presently known or yet to be discovered or synthesized. For example the single protein ligand that induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells may be selected from OSM Oncostatin M NCIB GeneID 5008 HGF hepatocyte growth factor NCIB GeneID 3082 BMP7 bone morphogenetic protein 7 NCIB GeneID 655 IGF2 insulin like growth factor 2 a.k.a. somatomedin A NCIB GeneID 3481 LIF Leukemia inhibitory factor NCIB GeneID 3976 PAR2 agonists e.g. SLIGKV NH IL 33 Interleukin 33 NCIB GeneID 90865 PAR4 agonists e.g. AYPGKF NH CTGF Connective tissue growth factor NCIB GeneID 1490 and BMP4 bone morphogenetic protein 4 NCIB GeneID 652 . In a preferred embodiment the single protein ligand is HGF or OSM either optionally supplemented with one of BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF or BMP4. In an alternative embodiment the single protein ligand is a ligand selected from OSM HGF BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF or BMP4 optionally supplemented with one of OSM HGF BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF or BMP4. The human versions of the above ligand proteins are preferred but where an alternative animal version exists e.g. from mouse rat rabbit dog monkey pig etc that also has activity in stimulating the human receptor on CFPAC 1 cells and induces EMT this may also be used.

In any of the methods or cell preparations of the invention described herein when a more complete EMT is sought as judged by E cadherin or vimentin expression the preferred single protein ligands to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells may comprise a ligand that binds to and activates the oncostatin M receptor e.g. OSM or a ligand that binds to and activates the HGF receptor a.k.a. Met receptor tyrosine kinase e.g. HGF . In an alternative embodiment the single protein ligand that induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells may comprise a protein ligand that binds to a receptor that activates the signal transduction pathways activated by the binding of oncostatin M to its receptor e.g. a ligand that binds to and activates the oncostatin M receptor e.g. oncostatin M or a protein ligand that binds to another receptor that activates the same signal transduction pathways as are activated by binding of oncostatin M to its receptor i.e. JAK STAT pathways or a ligand that binds to a cell tyrosine kinase receptor and activates the same signal transduction pathways that are activated by the binding of HGF to its receptor i.e. the PI3K and MAPK pathways as activated by binding of HGF to Met receptor tyrosine kinase .

Receptor tyrosine kinases that activate the PI3K and MAPK pathways include for example IGF1 R FGFR1 FGFR2 FGFR3 FGFR4 heterodimers of FGF receptors 1 4 RON EGFR HER 4 heterodimers of HER receptors 1 4 VEGFR 1 Flt 1 VEGFR 2 Flk 1 KDR VEGFR 3 Flt 4 and PDGFR and receptor homo and herero dimers . Thus examples of additional ligands that may induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells include IGF 1 FGF1 FGF2 FGF3 FGF4 FGF5 FGF6 FGF7 FGF8 FGF8 FGF10 macrophage stimulating protein MSP RON receptor ligand transforming growth factor TGF heparin binding EGF like growth factor HB EGF amphiregulin AREG betacellulin BTC epiregulin EREG epigen EPGN neuregulins NRG 1 Heregulin NRG 2 NRG 3 NRG 4 VEGF A VEGF B VEGF C VEGF D VEGF E PDGF AA PDGF AB PDGF BB PDGF CC and PDGF DD where sufficient receptor levels are present. The human versions of the above ligand proteins are preferred but where an alternative animal version exists e.g. from mouse rat rabbit dog monkey pig etc that also has activity in stimulating the human receptor on CFPAC 1 cells and induces EMT this may also be used.

The induction of EMT in CFPAC 1 cells by the specific ligands disclosed herein allows targeting of specific pathways that induce EMT and thus for identification of anticancer agents that may have different modes of action and may thus act together in a synergistic manner.

The sample of cells of the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 in any of the methods or preparations of this invention can be for example cells in monolayer culture e.g. cells in a tissue culture plate or dish e.g. a 96 well plate cells in three dimensional culture such as for example Matrigel 3D culture spheroid cultures or soft agar culture Kim J. B. 2005 Seminars in Cancer Biology 15 365 377 Sutherland R. M. 1988 Science 240 177 184 Hamilton G. 1998 Cancer Letters 131 29 34 or cells in vivo e.g. a tumor xenograft. In methods described herein that require an identical sample of cells this refers to a sample of cells with essentially the same number of cells growing under the same conditions. For example an identical tissue culture dish with approximately the same number of cells or a tumor xenograft of the same or similar size.

Many biomarkers are known whose level of expression or activity is indicative of the EMT status of tumor cells e.g. see US Patent Application Publication 2007 0212738 U.S. Patent Application 60 923 463 U.S. Patent Application 60 997 514 . Such markers tend to be classified as epithelial or mesenchymal due to their characteristic association with the particular stage of EMT. Characteristic biomarkers can be for example proteins encoding mRNAs activity of a gene promoter level of a transcriptional repressor or promoter methylation. In any of the methods described herein the biomarker whose expression level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells can be an epithelial cell biomarker. Epithelial cell biomarkers include for example E cadherin cytokeratin 8 cytokeratin 18 P cadherin or erbB3. Additional epithelial cell biomarkers include Brk catenin 1 catenin 2 catenin 3 catenin connexin 31 plakophilin 3 stratifin 1 laminin alpha 5 and ST14. In any of the methods described herein the biomarker whose expression level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells can also be a mesenchymal cell biomarker. Mesenchymal cell biomarkers include for example is vimentin fibronectin N cadherin zeb 1 twist FOXC2 or snail. Additional mesenchymal cell biomarkers include fibrillin 1 fibrillin 2 collagen alpha2 IV collagen alpha2 V LOXL1 nidogen C11orf9 tenascin tubulin alpha 3 and epimorphin. Additionally any other epithelial or mesenchymal cell biomarkers known in the art described herein or yet to be described may be used in the methods of the invention described herein. In any of the methods described herein multiple biomarker level determinations can also be used to assess EMT status potentially providing a more reliable assessment. For example an epithelial and a mesenchymal biomarker level may be assessed the reciprocal changes in each providing internal confirmation that EMT has occurred e.g. suitable biomarker pairs include for example E cadherin vimentin . In an alternative embodiment the epithelial biomarker comprises one or more keratins selected from the epithelial keratins 1 28 and 71 80 and the mesenchymal biomarker is vimentin wherein co expression of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers at similar levels is indicative of a mesenchymal like tumor cell see U.S. Patent Application 60 923 463 . When used in any of the methods of the invention described herein epithelial keratins 1 28 and 71 80 includes all the keratins listed in Table 2 herein. In one embodiment of the latter method the epithelial keratin s are assessed using a method that will detect all or the majority i.e. 50 or more of the keratin biomarkers expressed by the tumor cell e.g. by using a multi or pan specific antibody . In another embodiment of above methods where epithelial keratin biomarker levels are determined the biomarker comprises keratin 8 and or keratin 18.

The term co expression of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers at similar levels as used herein in the context of determining co expression of epithelial keratins and the mesenchymal biomarker vimentin means that the ratio of mesenchymal to epithelial biomarker levels is in the range of about 10 1 to about 1 10 assuming that each biomarker is assayed under comparable conditions e.g. using antibodies of identical affinity nucleic acid probes of identical length identical detection methods etc. .

In an alternative embodiment of any of the methods described herein that include a step of determining the level of a biomarker whose level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells the biomarker can be the activity of a gene promoter that is altered when the tumor cells undergo EMT. Such promoter activity is readily assessed by incorporating a promoter reporter construct into the tumor cells and measuring reporter activity. In one embodiment the activity of an epithelial biomarker gene promoter is assessed by inclusion of an epithelial biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct into the CFPAC 1 cells such that said promoter reporter activity can be monitored by reporter gene expression level or activity. For example the epithelial biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct may be an E cadherin promoter firefly luciferase construct. In an alternative embodiment the activity of a mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter is assessed by inclusion of a mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct into the CFPAC 1 cells such that said promoter reporter activity can be monitored by reporter gene expression level or activity. For example the mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct may be an vimentin promoter firefly luciferase construct. The promoter reporter gene construct may be permanently incorporated into the CFPAC 1 cells as a stable engineered cell line or may be transiently expressed using any of the standard techniques for transferring nucleic acid constructs into cells e.g. transfection electroporation . Multiple promoter reporter gene constructs may also be employed in order to monitor several biomarkers simultaneously e.g. an E cadherin promoter firefly luciferase construct and a vimentin promoter renilla luciferase construct in order to for example monitor simultaneous repression of the E cadherin gene and induction of the vimentin gene as tumor cells undergo EMT.

The present invention also provides a method of identifying an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition comprising contacting a sample of cells of the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 which have been engineered to inducibly express a protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells with a test agent to be screened contacting the sample with a compound that induces the expression of said protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the engineered CFPAC 1 cells determining whether the test agent inhibits the tumor cells in the sample from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition by comparing the level of a biomarker whose level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells to the level of the same biomarker in an identical sample of engineered CFPAC 1 cells not contacted with the test agent and thus determining whether the test agent is an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

 Inducibly express as used herein when referring for example to cells which have been engineered to inducibly express a protein means that the protein expression is only turned on by the presence or absence of an inducing agent that controls transcription of the gene encoding the protein which will preferably be incorporated into the cells by stable transformation with a construct containing the gene for the encoding protein under the control of a promoter that is responsive to the inducing agent i.e. the gene encoding the protein is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence regulating the gene expression which nucleotide sequence comprises a promoter sequence whose activity can be controlled by the presence of an inducing agent . One example of such an inducible promoter is a tetracycline tet responsive promoter e.g. a Tet on system e.g. see Gossen M. et al. 1995 Science 268 1766 1769 . Such inducible gene expression systems for controlling the expression levels of specific genes of interest are well known in the art e.g. see Blau H. M. and Rossi F. M. V. 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 797 799 Yamamoto A. et al. 2001 Neurobiology of Disease 8 923 932 Clackson T. 2000 Gene Therapy 7 120 125 .

For any of the methods or cell preparations described herein involving the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 which has been engineered to inducibly express a protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells in one embodiment the cells also comprise a promoter reporter gene construct that can be similarly inducibly expressed such that said promoter reporter activity can be monitored by reporter gene expression level or activity and thus be used to readily assess whether induction of the protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition has been successful. In one example of such an embodiment the reporter gene is the gene for firefly or luciferase. Assessment of reporter levels can for example be used for readily monitoring the extent of EMT induction of CFPAC 1 cells and the location of cells that have undergone EMT. Thus for example cells in vivo that have migrated from a primary tumor or metastasized can be readily tracked by monitoring such a reporter gene. Thus the present invention provides a method of identifying an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis comprising contacting in vivo a sample of cells of the epithelial tumor cell line CFPAC 1 which have been engineered to inducibly express both a protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells and a reporter gene product e.g. firefly luciferase and which have been allowed to form a tumor xenograft in an immunocompromised animal with a test agent to be screened contacting the sample with a compound that induces the expression of said protein that stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the engineered CFPAC 1 cells and the reporter gene product determining whether the test agent inhibits the tumor cells in the sample from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis by comparing the extent of migration of the sample tumor cells away from a primary tumor e.g. by imaging analysis of the reporter gene product to the extent of migration of an identical sample of engineered CFPAC 1 cells not contacted with the test agent and thus determining whether the test agent is an agent that inhibits tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis . Cells derived form an EMT transition in vivo can also be detected by surgical isolation and immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization using for example biomarkers as described herein or in US Patent Application Publication 2007 0212738 U.S. Patent Application 60 923 463 U.S. Patent Application 61 068 612 or U.S. Patent Application 60 997 514 .

Cell. 20 6 881 890 Bonano V. I. et al. 2007 Nat. Protoc. 2 9 2166 2181 and do not operate after EMT can be utilized as markers of EMT status. For example by including the sequences necessary for such epithelial specific splicing into a promoter luciferase construct incorporated into CFPAC 1 cells e.g. a CMV promoter firefly luciferase construct such that active luciferase will only be expressed in the epithelial state induction of EMT can readily be monitored by a decrease in luciferase expression or activity.

R. et al. 2007 RNA 13 1172 1178 Shell S. et al 2007 Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 104 27 11400 11405 that degrade or diminish translation of transcripts containing complementary nucleic acid sequences can be utilized as markers of EMT status. For example by including sequences complementary to such miRNAs into a promoter luciferase construct incorporated into CFPAC 1 cells e.g. a CMV promoter firefly luciferase construct such that active luciferase will not be expressed in the epithelial state induction of EMT can readily be monitored by an increase in luciferase expression or activity. Similarly in any of the other methods described herein involving a protein that is inducibly expressed and stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CFPAC 1 cells the biomarker whose level is indicative of the EMT status of the sample tumor cells can be any of the examples described above.

Cell. 20 6 881 890 Bonano V. I. et al. 2007 Nat. Protoc. 2 9 2166 2181 and do not operate prior to EMT in epithelial cells can be utilized as markers of EMT status. For example by including the sequences necessary for such mesenchymal specific splicing into a promoter luciferase construct incorporated into CFPAC 1 cells e.g. a CMV promoter firefly luciferase construct such that active luciferase will only be expressed in the mesenchymal state induction of EMT can readily be monitored by an increase in luciferase expression or activity. In an alternative embodiment miRNAs that are expressed specifically in human mesenchymal cells e.g. see Hurteau G. J. et al. 2007 Cancer Research 67 7972 7976 Christoffersen N.

In any of the methods or cell preparations described herein involving a biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct in the engineered CFPAC 1 cells for monitoring biomarker promoter activity more than one biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct may be employed so that multiple biomarkers may be simultaneously monitored in order to assess EMT status. For example in one embodiment an epithelial biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct and a mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct are both used such that decreases in epithelial biomarker gene promoter activity and increases in mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter activity can both be monitored during EMT. For example the epithelial biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct may be an E cadherin promoter firefly luciferase construct and the mesenchymal biomarker gene promoter reporter gene construct may be a vimentin promoter renilla luciferase construct. By using two different reporter genes that can be independently monitored e.g. two luciferases that produce products that take part in luminescent reactions involving the emission of light of different characteristic wavelengths e.g. see Hawkins E.

An alternative embodiment of this method comprises after the step of determining whether the test agent inhibits the growth of tumor cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition the additional steps of determining whether an agent that inhibits mesenchymal like CFPAC 1 tumor cell growth also inhibits epithelial CFPAC 1 tumor cell growth and thus determining whether it is an agent that specifically inhibits the growth of tumor cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In an embodiment of the above methods an agent that inhibits the growth of tumor cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition is determined to do so by stimulating apoptosis of said tumor cells. In another embodiment of the above methods an agent that inhibits the growth of tumor cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition is determined to do so by inhibiting proliferation of said tumor cells.

As described herein these cell preparations can be used for screening test agents to identify agents that inhibit either cell type or to find agents that will inhibit EMT or stimulate MET.

In the context of the methods of this invention epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers expressed by a tumor cell can include molecular and cellular markers that indicate the transition state of the tumor cell. In a preferred embodiment the biomarker is an individual marker protein or its encoding mRNA characteristic of the particular transition state of the tumor cell i.e. a tumor cell exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics. In an alternative embodiment in certain circumstances the biomarker may be a characteristic morphological pattern produced in the tumor cell by cellular macromolecules that is characteristic of either an epithelial or mesenchymal condition. Thus morphometric cell analysis can be used to provide information on epithelial or mesenchymal status of tumor cells. In an additional embodiment the biomarker that indicates the transition state of the tumor cell is methylation of the E Cadherin gene CDH1 promoter. CDH1 promoter methylation indicates that tumor cells have undergone an EMT transition.

Table 1 lists genes coding for examples of epithelial or mesenchymal molecular biomarkers that can be used in the practice of the methods of the invention described herein. The epithelial or mesenchymal molecular biomarkers can include any product expressed by these genes including variants thereof e.g. expressed mRNA or protein splice variants co and post translationally modified proteins polymorphic variants etc. In one embodiment the biomarker is the embryonal EDB fibronectin a splice variant expressed by the fibronectin 1 gene Kilian O. et al. 2004 Bone 35 6 1334 1345 . A possible advantage of determining this fetal form of fibronectin is that one could readily distinguish mesenchymal like tumors from surrounding stromal tissue.

In another embodiment of the methods of this invention the mesenchymal biomarker is methylation of the promoter of a gene whose transcription is repressed as a result of EMT in the tumor cell. In the context of this method high levels of a tumor cell mesenchymal biomarker essentially means readily detectable methylation of the promoter e.g. a strong signal during detection of a methylation specific PCR amplified nucleic acid product derived from a promoter methylation site whereas low levels of a tumor cell mesenchymal biomarker essentially means no detectable or low methylation of the promoter e.g. no or a comparatively weak signal during detection of a methylation specific PCR amplified nucleic acid product derived from a promoter methylation site .

The biomarkers in the above lists of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers have been identified as being altered in expression level or phosphoylation level for phospho proteins after EMT see for example US Patent Application Publication 2007 0212738 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference US Published Application 2006 0211060 filed Mar. 16 2006 Thomson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 and Yauch R. L. et al. 2005 Clin. Can. Res. 11 24 8686 8698 .

In the methods of this invention biomarker expression level can be assessed relative to a control molecule whose expression level remains constant throughout EMT or when comparing tumor cells expressing either epithelial or mesenchymal transition states as indicated by molecular biomarkers e.g. a housekeeping gene such as GAPDH actin tubulin or the like . Biomarker expression level can also be assessed relative to the other type of tumor cell biomarker i.e. epithelial compared to mesenchymal or to the biomarker level in non tumor cells of the same tissue or another cell or tissue source used as an assay reference.

In the methods of this invention the level of an epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker expressed by a tumor cell can be assessed by using any of the standard bioassay procedures known in the art for determination of the level of expression of a gene including for example ELISA RIA immunopreciptation immunoblotting immunofluorescence microscopy immunohistochemistry IHC RT PCR in situ hybridization cDNA microarray or the like as described in more detail below. In an embodiment of any of these methods their use is coupled with a method to isolate a particular cell population e.g. laser capture microdissection LCM . In an additional embodiment FACS analysis can be used with immunofluorescence biomarker e.g. E cadherin labeling to isolate and quantify cell populations expressing different epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers and thus for example the percentage of cells that have undergone an EMT can be estimated e.g. see Xu Z. et al. 2003 Cell Research 13 5 343 350 .

In the methods of this invention the expression level of a tumor cell epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker in vivo is preferably assessed by assaying a tumor biopsy. In one embodiment the biopsy comprises samples taken from multiple areas of the tumor or a method e.g. core needle biopsy that samples different areas of the tumor thus ensuring that when the tumor is of a heterogeneous nature with respect to the types of cells it contains that a representative biopsy is obtained. In an alternative embodiment given that a tumor may be heterogeneous with respect to the EMT status of the cells it contains the methods of this invention are preferably applied separately to different cell types e.g. using IHC or an analysis method coupled with a step to isolate a particular cell population . Alternatively by employing cell surface epithelial and or mesenchymal biomarker antibodies e.g. to E cadherin FACS analysis can be used to isolate and quantify the numbers of tumor cells at different stages of EMT.

However in an alternative embodiment expression level of the tumor cell biomarker can be assessed in bodily fluids or excretions containing detectable levels of biomarkers originating from the tumor or tumor cells. Bodily fluids or excretions useful in the present invention include blood urine saliva stool pleural fluid lymphatic fluid sputum ascites prostatic fluid cerebrospinal fluid CSF or any other bodily secretion or derivative thereof. By blood it is meant to include whole blood plasma serum or any derivative of blood. Assessment of tumor epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers in such bodily fluids or excretions can sometimes be preferred in circumstances where an invasive sampling method is inappropriate or inconvenient.

For assessment of tumor cell epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker expression tumor samples containing tumor cells or proteins or nucleic acids produced by these tumor cells may be used in the methods of the present invention. In these embodiments the level of expression of the biomarker can be assessed by assessing the amount e.g. absolute amount or concentration of the marker in a tumor cell sample e.g. a tumor biopsy obtained from an animal or another sample containing material derived from the tumor e.g. blood serum urine or other bodily fluids or excretions as described herein above . The cell sample can of course be subjected to a variety of well known post collection preparative and storage techniques e.g. nucleic acid and or protein extraction fixation storage freezing ultrafiltration concentration evaporation centrifugation etc. prior to assessing the amount of the marker in the sample. Likewise tumor biopsies may also be subjected to post collection preparative and storage techniques e.g. fixation.

Determination of epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker levels in in vivo studies can be assessed by a number of different approaches including direct analysis of proteins that segregate as epithelial related e.g. E cadherin or mesenchymal related e.g. vimentin Zeb1 biomarkers. An advantage of this approach is that EMT markers are read directly and the relative amounts of cell populations expressing epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers can readily be examined and quantified by for example FACS analysis e.g. see Xu Z. et al. 2003 Cell Research 13 5 343 350 . However this approach also requires sufficient quantities of cells or tissue in order to perform an analysis e.g. immunohistochemistry . Sufficient quantities of tissue may be difficult to obtain from certain procedures such as FNA fine needle aspiration . Core biopsies provide larger amounts of tissue but are sometimes not readily available. Alternatively these EMT biomarkers could be evaluated based upon the expression level of their encoding RNA transcripts using a quantitative PCR based approach. An advantage of this approach is that very few tumor cells are required for this measurement and it is very likely that sufficient material may be obtained via an FNA. However here the transcript levels for a given biomarker may be derived from both tumor cells as well as infiltrating stromal cells from the tumor. Given that stromal cells also express mesenchymal cell markers this may obscure detection of the EMT status for tumor cells. Use of in situ hybridization e.g. FISH or tissue microdisection may be useful here to overcome this potential limitation.

Given that the expression level of E cadherin is a hallmark of the EMT status for a tumor cell EMT may also be evaluated based upon the methylation status of the E cadherin promoter as described herein. Methylation silences transcription and so a high level of methylation correlates with a mesenchymal like state. A potential benefit of this approach is that like measurement of transcript levels measuring the methylation status of DNA would likely require very little material. Sufficient material could likely be obtained from an FNA and would not require a core biopsy. Additionally since this approach involves evaluation of DNA and not RNA it is likely to be a more stable read out over time such as during medium or long term storage of a sample.

In the methods of the invention one can detect expression of biomarker proteins having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of tumor cells which express it. It is a simple matter for the skilled artisan to determine whether a marker protein or a portion thereof is exposed on the cell surface. For example immunological methods may be used to detect such proteins on whole cells or well known computer based sequence analysis methods may be used to predict the presence of at least one extracellular domain i.e. including both secreted proteins and proteins having at least one cell surface domain . Expression of a marker protein having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of a cell which expresses it may be detected without necessarily lysing the tumor cell e.g. using a labeled antibody which binds specifically with a cell surface domain of the protein .

Expression of a biomarkers described in this invention may be assessed by any of a wide variety of well known methods for detecting expression of a transcribed nucleic acid or protein. Non limiting examples of such methods include immunological methods for detection of secreted cell surface cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins protein purification methods protein function or activity assays nucleic acid hybridization methods nucleic acid reverse transcription methods and nucleic acid amplification methods.

In one embodiment expression of a biomarker is assessed using an antibody e.g. a radio labeled chromophore labeled fluorophore labeled or enzyme labeled antibody an antibody derivative e.g. an antibody conjugated with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein ligand pair e.g. biotin streptavidin or an antibody fragment e.g. a single chain antibody an isolated antibody hypervariable domain etc. which binds specifically with a biomarker protein or fragment thereof including a biomarker protein which has undergone either all or a portion of post translational modifications to which it is normally subjected in the tumor cell e.g. glycosylation phosphorylation methylation etc. .

In another embodiment expression of a biomarker is assessed by preparing mRNA cDNA i.e. a transcribed polynucleotide from tumor cells and by hybridizing the mRNA cDNA with a reference polynucleotide which is a complement of a biomarker nucleic acid or a fragment thereof cDNA can optionally be amplified using any of a variety of polymerase chain reaction methods prior to hybridization with the reference polynucleotide. Expression of one or more biomarkers can likewise be detected using quantitative PCR to assess the level of expression of the biomarker s . Alternatively any of the many known methods of detecting mutations or variants e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms deletions etc. of a biomarker of the invention may be used to detect occurrence of a biomarker in a tumor cell.

In a related embodiment a mixture of transcribed polynucleotides obtained from the sample is contacted with a substrate having fixed thereto a polynucleotide complementary to or homologous with at least a portion e.g. at least 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 100 500 or more nucleotide residues of a biomarker nucleic acid. If polynucleotides complementary to or homologous with are differentially detectable on the substrate e.g. detectable using different chromophores or fluorophores or fixed to different selected positions then the levels of expression of a plurality of biomarkers can be assessed simultaneously using a single substrate e.g. a gene chip microarray of polynucleotides fixed at selected positions . When a method of assessing biomarker expression is used which involves hybridization of one nucleic acid with another it is preferred that the hybridization be performed under stringent hybridization conditions.

When a plurality of biomarkers of the invention are used in the methods of the invention the level of expression of each biomarker in tumor cells induced to undergo EMT can be compared with the level of expression of each of the plurality of biomarkers in non induced samples of the same type either in a single reaction mixture i.e. using reagents such as different fluorescent probes for each biomarker or in individual reaction mixtures corresponding to one or more of the biomarkers.

An exemplary method for detecting the presence or absence of a biomarker protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample involves obtaining a biological sample e.g. a tumor associated body fluid from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting the polypeptide or nucleic acid e.g. mRNA genomic DNA or cDNA . The detection methods of the invention can thus be used to detect mRNA protein cDNA or genomic DNA for example in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example in vitro techniques for detection of mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of a biomarker protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs Western blots immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. In vivo techniques for detection of mRNA include polymerase chain reaction PCR Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. Furthermore in vivo techniques for detection of a biomarker protein include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against the protein or fragment thereof. For example the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques.

A general principle of such diagnostic and prognostic assays involves preparing a sample or reaction mixture that may contain a biomarker and a probe under appropriate conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the biomarker and probe to interact and bind thus forming a complex that can be removed and or detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of ways.

For example one method to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring the biomarker or probe onto a solid phase support also referred to as a substrate and detecting target biomarker probe complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method a sample from a subject which is to be assayed for presence and or concentration of biomarker can be anchored onto a carrier or solid phase support. In another embodiment the reverse situation is possible in which the probe can be anchored to a solid phase and a sample from a subject can be allowed to react as an unanchored component of the assay.

There are many established methods for anchoring assay components to a solid phase. These include without limitation biomarker or probe molecules which are immobilized through conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Such biotinylated assay components can be prepared from biotin NHS N hydroxy succinimide using techniques known in the art e.g. biotinylation kit Pierce Chemicals Rockford Ill. and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin coated 96 well plates Pierce Chemical . In certain embodiments the surfaces with immobilized assay components can be prepared in advance and stored.

Other suitable carriers or solid phase supports for such assays include any material capable of binding the class of molecule to which the biomarker or probe belongs. Well known supports or carriers include but are not limited to glass polystyrene nylon polypropylene nylon polyethylene dextran amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite.

In order to conduct assays with the above mentioned approaches the non immobilized component is added to the solid phase upon which the second component is anchored. After the reaction is complete uncomplexed components may be removed e.g. by washing under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized upon the solid phase. The detection of biomarker probe complexes anchored to the solid phase can be accomplished in a number of methods outlined herein.

In one embodiment the probe when it is the unanchored assay component can be labeled for the purpose of detection and readout of the assay either directly or indirectly with detectable labels discussed herein and which are well known to one skilled in the art.

It is also possible to directly detect biomarker probe complex formation without further manipulation or labeling of either component biomarker or probe for example by utilizing the technique of fluorescence energy transfer i.e. FET see for example Lakowicz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 169 Stavrianopoulos et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 868 103 . A fluorophore label on the first donor molecule is selected such that upon excitation with incident light of appropriate wavelength its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second acceptor molecule which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately the donor protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light such that the acceptor molecule label may be differentiated from that of the donor . Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules spatial relationships between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules the fluorescent emission of the acceptor molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art e.g. using a fluorimeter .

In another embodiment determination of the ability of a probe to recognize a biomarker can be accomplished without labeling either assay component probe or biomarker by utilizing a technology such as real time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis BIA see e.g. Sjolander S and Urbaniczky C. 1991 Anal. Chem. 63 2338 2345 and Szabo et al. 1995 Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5 699 705 . As used herein BIA or surface plasmon resonance is a technology for studying biospecific interactions in real time without labeling any of the interactants e.g. BIAcore . Changes in the mass at the binding surface indicative of a binding event result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance SPR resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real time reactions between biological molecules.

Alternatively in another embodiment analogous diagnostic and prognostic assays can be conducted with biomarker and probe as solutes in a liquid phase. In such an assay the complexed biomarker and probe are separated from uncomplexed components by any of a number of standard techniques including but not limited to differential centrifugation chromatography electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. In differential centrifugation biomarker probe complexes may be separated from uncomplexed assay components through a series of centrifugal steps due to the different sedimentation equilibria of complexes based on their different sizes and densities see for example Rivas G. and Minton A. P. 1993 Trends Biochem Sci. 18 8 284 7 . Standard chromatographic techniques may also be utilized to separate complexed molecules from uncomplexed ones. For example gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on size and through the utilization of an appropriate gel filtration resin in a column format for example the relatively larger complex may be separated from the relatively smaller uncomplexed components. Similarly the relatively different charge properties of the biomarker probe complex as compared to the uncomplexed components may be exploited to differentiate the complex from uncomplexed components for example through the utilization of ion exchange chromatography resins. Such resins and chromatographic techniques are well known to one skilled in the art see e.g. Heegaard N. H. 1998 J. Mol. Recognit. Winter 11 1 6 141 8 Hage D. S. and Tweed S. A. J. Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl 1997 Oct. 10 699 1 2 499 525 . Gel electrophoresis may also be employed to separate complexed assay components from unbound components see e.g. Ausubel et al. ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1987 1999 . In this technique protein or nucleic acid complexes are separated based on size or charge for example. In order to maintain the binding interaction during the electrophoretic process non denaturing gel matrix materials and conditions in the absence of reducing agent are typically preferred. Appropriate conditions to the particular assay and components thereof will be well known to one skilled in the art.

In a particular embodiment the level of biomarker mRNA can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats in a biological sample using methods known in the art. The term biological sample is intended to include tissues cells biological fluids and isolates thereof isolated from a subject as well as tissues cells and fluids present within a subject. Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA. For in vitro methods any RNA isolation technique that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the purification of RNA from tumor cells see e.g. Ausubel et al. ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1987 1999 . Additionally large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art such as for example the single step RNA isolation process of Chomczynski 1989 U.S. Pat. No. 4 843 155 .

The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include but are not limited to Southern or Northern analyses polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One preferred diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule probe that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be for example a full length cDNA or a portion thereof such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7 15 30 50 100 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to a mRNA or genomic DNA encoding a biomarker of the present invention. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays of the invention are described herein. Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the biomarker in question is being expressed.

In one format the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative format the probe s are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe s for example in an Affymetrix gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoded by the biomarkers of the present invention.

An alternative method for determining the level of mRNA biomarker in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification e.g. by RT PCR the experimental embodiment set forth in Mullis 1987 U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 202 ligase chain reaction Barany 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 189 193 self sustained sequence replication Guatelli et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 1874 1878 transcriptional amplification system Kwoh et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 1173 1177 Q Beta Replicase Lizardi et al. 1988 Bio Technology 6 1197 rolling circle replication Lizardi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 854 033 or any other nucleic acid amplification method followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. As used herein amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that can anneal to 5 or 3 regions of a gene plus and minus strands respectively or vice versa and contain a short region in between. In general amplification primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers.

For in situ methods mRNA does not need to be isolated from the tumor cells prior to detection. In such methods a cell or tissue sample is prepared processed using known histological methods. The sample is then immobilized on a support typically a glass slide and then contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the biomarker.

As an alternative to making determinations based on the absolute expression level of the biomarker determinations may be based on the normalized expression level of the biomarker. Expression levels are normalized by correcting the absolute expression level of a biomarker by comparing its expression to the expression of a gene that is not a biomarker e.g. a housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed. Suitable genes for normalization include housekeeping genes such as the actin gene or epithelial cell specific genes. This normalization allows the comparison of the expression level in one sample e.g. a tumor cell sample to another sample e.g. a non tumor sample or between samples from different sources or between samples before and after induction of EMT.

Alternatively the expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. To determine a relative expression level of a biomarker e.g. a mesenchymal biomarker the level of expression of the biomarker is determined for 10 or more samples of normal versus cancer cell isolates preferably 50 or more samples prior to the determination of the expression level for the sample in question. The mean expression level of each of the genes assayed in the larger number of samples is determined and this is used as a baseline expression level for the biomarker. The expression level of the biomarker determined for the test sample absolute level of expression is then divided by the mean expression value obtained for that biomarker. This provides a relative expression level.

In another embodiment of the present invention a biomarker protein is detected. A preferred agent for detecting biomarker protein of the invention is an antibody capable of binding to such a protein or a fragment thereof preferably an antibody with a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal or more preferably monoclonal. An intact antibody or a fragment or derivative thereof e.g. Fab or F ab .sub.2 can be used. The term labeled with regard to the probe or antibody is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling i.e. physically linking a detectable substance to the probe or antibody as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin.

Proteins from tumor cells can be isolated using techniques that are well known to those of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed can for example be such as those described in Harlow and Lane Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. .

A variety of formats can be employed to determine whether a sample contains a protein that binds to a given antibody. Examples of such formats include but are not limited to enzyme immunoassay EIA radioimmunoassay RIA Western blot analysis and enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay ELISA . A skilled artisan can readily adapt known protein antibody detection methods for use in determining whether tumor cells express a biomarker of the present invention.

In one format antibodies or antibody fragments or derivatives can be used in methods such as Western blots or immunofluorescence techniques to detect the expressed proteins. In such uses it is generally preferable to immobilize either the antibody or proteins on a solid support. Suitable solid phase supports or carriers include any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well known supports or carriers include glass polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene dextran nylon amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite.

One skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen and will be able to adapt such support for use with the present invention. For example protein isolated from tumor cells can be run on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immobilized onto a solid phase support such as nitrocellulose. The support can then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled antibody. The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on the solid support can then be detected by conventional means.

For ELISA assays specific binding pairs can be of the immune or non immune type. Immune specific binding pairs are exemplified by antigen antibody systems or hapten anti hapten systems. There can be mentioned fluorescein anti fluorescein dinitrophenyl anti dinitrophenyl biotin anti biotin peptide anti peptide and the like. The antibody member of the specific binding pair can be produced by customary methods familiar to those skilled in the art. Such methods involve immunizing an animal with the antigen member of the specific binding pair. If the antigen member of the specific binding pair is not immunogenic e.g. a hapten it can be covalently coupled to a carrier protein to render it immunogenic. Non immune binding pairs include systems wherein the two components share a natural affinity for each other but are not antibodies. Exemplary non immune pairs are biotin streptavidin intrinsic factor vitamin B folic acid folate binding protein and the like.

A variety of methods are available to covalently label antibodies with members of specific binding pairs. Methods are selected based upon the nature of the member of the specific binding pair the type of linkage desired and the tolerance of the antibody to various conjugation chemistries. Biotin can be covalently coupled to antibodies by utilizing commercially available active derivatives. Some of these are biotin N hydroxy succinimide which binds to amine groups on proteins biotin hydrazide which binds to carbohydrate moieties aldehydes and carboxyl groups via a carbodiimide coupling and biotin maleimide and iodoacetyl biotin which bind to sulfhydryl groups. Fluorescein can be coupled to protein amine groups using fluorescein isothiocyanate. Dinitrophenyl groups can be coupled to protein amine groups using 2 4 dinitrobenzene sulfate or 2 4 dinitrofluorobenzene. Other standard methods of conjugation can be employed to couple monoclonal antibodies to a member of a specific binding pair including dialdehyde carbodiimide coupling homofunctional crosslinking and heterobifunctional crosslinking. Carbodiimide coupling is an effective method of coupling carboxyl groups on one substance to amine groups on another. Carbodiimide coupling is facilitated by using the commercially available reagent 1 ethyl 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide EDAC .

Homobifunctional crosslinkers including the bifunctional imidoesters and bifunctional N hydroxysuccinimide esters are commercially available and are employed for coupling amine groups on one substance to amine groups on another. Heterobifunctional crosslinkers are reagents which possess different functional groups. The most common commercially available heterobifunctional crosslinkers have an amine reactive N hydroxysuccinimide ester as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the second functional group. The most common sulfhydryl reactive groups are maleimides pyridyl disulfides and active halogens. One of the functional groups can be a photoactive aryl nitrene which upon irradiation reacts with a variety of groups.

The detectably labeled antibody or detectably labeled member of the specific binding pair is prepared by coupling to a reporter which can be a radioactive isotope enzyme fluorogenic chemiluminescent or electrochemical materials. Two commonly used radioactive isotopes are I and H. Standard radioactive isotopic labeling procedures include the chloramine T lactoperoxidase and Bolton Hunter methods for I and reductive methylation for H. The term detectably labeled refers to a molecule labeled in such a way that it can be readily detected by the intrinsic enzymic activity of the label or by the binding to the label of another component which can itself be readily detected.

Enzymes suitable for use in this invention include but are not limited to horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucose oxidase luciferases including firefly and lactamase urease green fluorescent protein GFP and lysozyme. Enzyme labeling is facilitated by using dialdehyde carbodiimide coupling homobifunctional crosslinkers and heterobifunctional crosslinkers as described above for coupling an antibody with a member of a specific binding pair.

The labeling method chosen depends on the functional groups available on the enzyme and the material to be labeled and the tolerance of both to the conjugation conditions. The labeling method used in the present invention can be one of but not limited to any conventional methods currently employed including those described by Engvall and Pearlmann Immunochemistry 8 871 1971 Avrameas and Ternynck Immunochemistry 8 1175 1975 Ishikawa et al. J. Immunoassay 4 3 209 327 1983 and Jablonski Anal. Biochem. 148 199 1985 .

Labeling can be accomplished by indirect methods such as using spacers or other members of specific binding pairs. An example of this is the detection of a biotinylated antibody with unlabeled streptavidin and biotinylated enzyme with streptavidin and biotinylated enzyme being added either sequentially or simultaneously. Thus according to the present invention the antibody used to detect can be detectably labeled directly with a reporter or indirectly with a first member of a specific binding pair. When the antibody is coupled to a first member of a specific binding pair then detection is effected by reacting the antibody first member of a specific binding complex with the second member of the binding pair that is labeled or unlabeled as mentioned above.

Moreover the unlabeled detector antibody can be detected by reacting the unlabeled antibody with a labeled antibody specific for the unlabeled antibody. In this instance detectably labeled as used above is taken to mean containing an epitope by which an antibody specific for the unlabeled antibody can bind. Such an anti antibody can be labeled directly or indirectly using any of the approaches discussed above. For example the anti antibody can be coupled to biotin which is detected by reacting with the streptavidin horseradish peroxidase system discussed above.

In one embodiment of this invention biotin is utilized. The biotinylated antibody is in turn reacted with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase complex. Orthophenylenediamine 4 chloro naphthol tetramethylbenzidine TMB ABTS BTS or ASA can be used to effect chromogenic detection.

In one immunoassay format for practicing this invention a forward sandwich assay is used in which the capture reagent has been immobilized using conventional techniques on the surface of a support. Suitable supports used in assays include synthetic polymer supports such as polypropylene polystyrene substituted polystyrene e.g. aminated or carboxylated polystyrene polyacrylamides polyamides polyvinylchloride glass beads agarose or nitrocellulose.

Agents or compositions comprising such agents that inhibit tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition inhibit tumor cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition or stimulate mesenchymal like tumor cells to undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition identified by the methods described herein can be used in methods for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient.

As used herein the term patient preferably refers to a human in need of treatment with an anti cancer agent for any purpose and more preferably a human in need of such a treatment to treat cancer or a precancerous condition or lesion. However the term patient can also refer to non human animals preferably mammals such as dogs cats horses cows pigs sheep and non human primates among others that are in need of treatment with an anti cancer agent.

Anti cancer agents identified by any of the methods described herein or compositions comprising them can be used to treat any of the following tumors or cancers NSCL breast colon or pancreatic cancer lung cancer bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer bone cancer skin cancer cancer of the head or neck cutaneous or intraocular melanoma uterine cancer ovarian cancer rectal cancer cancer of the anal region stomach cancer gastric cancer uterine cancer carcinoma of the fallopian tubes carcinoma of the endometrium carcinoma of the vagina carcinoma of the vulva Hodgkin s Disease cancer of the esophagus cancer of the small intestine cancer of the endocrine system cancer of the thyroid gland cancer of the parathyroid gland cancer of the adrenal gland sarcoma of soft tissue cancer of the urethra cancer of the penis prostate cancer cancer of the bladder cancer of the ureter cancer of the kidney renal cell carcinoma carcinoma of the renal pelvis mesothelioma hepatocellular cancer biliary cancer chronic or acute leukemia lymphocytic lymphomas neoplasms of the central nervous system CNS spinal axis tumors brain stem glioma glioblastoma multiforme astrocytomas schwannomas ependymomas medulloblastomas meningiomas squamous cell carcinomas pituitary adenomas including refractory versions of any of the above cancers or a combination of one or more of the above cancers.

The term refractory as used herein is used to define a cancer for which treatment e.g. chemotherapy drugs biological agents and or radiation therapy has proven to be ineffective. A refractory cancer tumor may shrink but not to the point where the treatment is determined to be effective. Typically however the tumor stays the same size as it was before treatment stable disease or it grows progressive disease .

Anti cancer agents identified by any of the methods described herein or compositions comprising them can be used to treat abnormal cell growth.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the medical arts that the exact manner of administering to said patient of a therapeutically effective amount of the identified agent e.g. in a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and said agent will be at the discretion of the attending physician. The mode of administration including dosage combination with other anti cancer agents timing and frequency of administration and the like may be affected by e.g. a diagnosis of a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR or IGFR kinase inhibitor as well as the patient s condition and history. Thus even patients diagnosed with tumors predicted to be relatively sensitive to e.g. an EGFR or IGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent may still benefit from treatment with a combination of such a kinase inhibitor and the identified agent optionally in combination with other anti cancer agents or other agents that may alter a tumor s sensitivity to kinase inhibitors.

In the context of this invention an effective amount of an agent or therapy is as defined above. A sub therapeutic amount of an agent or therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent or therapy but when combined with an effective or sub therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a result desired by the physician due to for example synergy in the resulting efficacious effects or reduced side effects.

Additionally the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of for example an EGFR or IGFR kinase inhibitor and the identified agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The present invention further provides a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of the identified agent described herein above and optionally one or more other anticancer agents.

Dosage levels for the identified agents of this invention will be as described herein but will depend upon a variety of factors including the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration rate of excretion drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

The use of the cytotoxic and other anticancer agents described above in chemotherapeutic regimens is generally well characterized in the cancer therapy arts and their use herein falls under the same considerations for monitoring tolerance and effectiveness and for controlling administration routes and dosages with some adjustments. For example the actual dosages of the cytotoxic agents may vary depending upon the patient s cultured cell response determined by using histoculture methods. Generally the dosage will be reduced compared to the amount used in the absence of additional other agents.

Typical dosages of an effective cytotoxic agent can be in the ranges recommended by the manufacturer and where indicated by in vitro responses or responses in animal models can be reduced by up to about one order of magnitude concentration or amount. Thus the actual dosage will depend upon the judgment of the physician the condition of the patient and the effectiveness of the therapeutic method based on the in vitro responsiveness of the primary cultured malignant cells or histocultured tissue sample or the responses observed in the appropriate animal models.

As used herein the term EGFR kinase inhibitor refers to any EGFR kinase inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future and includes any chemical entity that upon administration to a patient results in inhibition of a biological activity associated with activation of the EGF receptor in the patient including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to EGFR of its natural ligand. Such EGFR kinase inhibitors include any agent that can block EGFR activation or any of the downstream biological effects of EGFR activation that are relevant to treating cancer in a patient. Such an inhibitor can act by binding directly to the intracellular domain of the receptor and inhibiting its kinase activity. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by occupying the ligand binding site or a portion thereof of the EGF receptor thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its natural ligand so that its normal biological activity is prevented or reduced. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by modulating the dimerization of EGFR polypeptides or interaction of EGFR polypeptide with other proteins or enhance ubiquitination and endocytotic degradation of EGFR. EGFR kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to low molecular weight inhibitors antibodies or antibody fragments peptide or RNA aptamers antisense constructs small inhibitory RNAs i.e. RNA interference by dsRNA RNAi and ribozymes. In a preferred embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor is a small organic molecule or an antibody that binds specifically to the human EGFR.

EGFR kinase inhibitors also include for example multi kinase inhibitors that have activity on EGFR kinase i.e. inhibitors that inhibit EGFR kinase and one or more additional kinases. Examples of such compounds include the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor CI 1033 formerly known as PD183805 Pfizer the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor GW 2016 also known as GW 572016 or lapatinib ditosylate GSK the EGFR and JAK 2 3 inhibitor AG490 a tyrphostin the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor ARRY 334543 Array BioPharma BIBW 2992 an irreversible dual EGFR HER2 kinase inhibitor Boehringer Ingelheim Corp. the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor EKB 569 Wyeth the VEGF R2 and EGFR inhibitor ZD6474 also known as ZACTIMA AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals and the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor BMS 599626 Bristol Myers Squibb .

Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include any anti EGFR antibody or antibody fragment that can partially or completely block EGFR activation by its natural ligand. Non limiting examples of antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include those described in Modjtahedi H. et al. 1993 Br. J. Cancer 67 247 253 Teramoto T. et al. 1996 Cancer 77 639 645 Goldstein et al. 1995 Clin. Cancer Res. 1 1311 1318 Huang S.

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be peptide or RNA aptamers. Such aptamers can for example interact with the extracellular or intracellular domains of EGFR to inhibit EGFR kinase activity in cells. An aptamer that interacts with the extracellular domain is preferred as it would not be necessary for such an aptamer to cross the plasma membrane of the target cell. An aptamer could also interact with the ligand for EGFR e.g. EGF TGF such that its ability to activate EGFR is inhibited. Methods for selecting an appropriate aptamer are well known in the art. Such methods have been used to select both peptide and RNA aptamers that interact with and inhibit EGFR family members e.g. see Buerger C. et al. et al. 2003 J. Biol. Chem. 278 37610 37621 Chen C H. B. et al. 2003 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100 9226 9231 Buerger C. and Groner B. 2003 J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 129 12 669 675. Epub 2003 Sep. 11. .

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be based on antisense oligonucleotide constructs. Anti sense oligonucleotides including anti sense RNA molecules and anti sense DNA molecules would act to directly block the translation of EGFR mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation thus decreasing the level of EGFR kinase protein and thus activity in a cell. For example antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding EGFR can be synthesized e.g. by conventional phosphodiester techniques and administered by e.g. intravenous injection or infusion. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 566 135 6 566 131 6 365 354 6 410 323 6 107 091 6 046 321 and 5 981 732 .

Small inhibitory RNAs siRNAs can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. EGFR gene expression can be reduced by contacting the tumor subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA dsRNA or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA such that expression of EGFR is specifically inhibited i.e. RNA interference or RNAi . Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known e.g. see Tuschi T. et al. 1999 Genes Dev. 13 24 3191 3197 Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Hannon G. J. 2002 Nature 418 244 251 McManus M. T. and Sharp P. A. 2002 Nature Reviews Genetics 3 737 747 Bremmelkamp T. R. et al. 2002 Science 296 550 553 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 573 099 and 6 506 559 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01 36646 WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 .

Ribozymes can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hairpin or hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of EGFR mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which typically include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using e.g. ribonuclease protection assays.

Both antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as EGFR kinase inhibitors can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as e.g. by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively anti sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 and or 3 ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or 2 O methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.

As used herein the term IGF 1R kinase inhibitor refers to any IGF 1R kinase inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future and includes any chemical entity that upon administration to a patient results in inhibition of a biological activity associated with activation of the IGF 1 receptor in the patient including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to IGF 1R of its natural ligand. Such IGF 1R kinase inhibitors include any agent that can block IGF 1R activation or any of the downstream biological effects of IGF 1R activation that are relevant to treating cancer in a patient.

The ability of cell lines to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT was investigated using different extracellular ligand drivers. A panel of NSCLC pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines were screened by treatment of cells for 7 days in presence of respective ligands either singly or in combination. Initial screening determined the ability of the ligand to cause morphology change to down regulate the epithelial marker e cadherin or to up regulate a mesenchymal marker such as vimentin. Potential EMT cell models should up regulate a mesenchymal marker and display morphology change. More robust models would show a down regulation of e cadherin expression. For those models where protein levels of e cadherin were not substantially down regulated it is postulated that e cadherin is mislocalized.

The CFPAC 1 pancreatic cell line has the propensity to undergo the EMT process with a variety of ligands. summarizes a proportion of ligands tested that have impact on upregulating vimentin with some ligand treatments giving marked downregulation of E cadherin.

The following conclusions were made. HGF and OSM induce the most complete EMT in CFPAC 1 cells. Partial EMT was observed with BMP7 IGF2 LIF PAR2 agonist SLIGKV NH IL 33 PAR4 agonist AYPGKF NH CTGF and BMP4.

Studies to further investigate the role of HGF and OSM to drive CFPAC 1 cells were performed. CFPAC 1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of HGF or OSM for 7 days to determine optimal conditions that would exhibit protein marker changes for E cadherin and vimentin . Using optimal conditions of HGF and OSM effects of EMT were monitored for morphology change for marker changes b confocal and for the ability of cells to increase migration and invasion was investigated . As shown cells that were treated with ligand were better able to migrate and invade.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition process for CFPAC 1 cells can be reversed upon withdrawal of the stimulating ligands HGF OSM or with the combination of HGF and OSM .

The signaling events for the ability of OSM to trigger EMT in CFPAC 1 cells was investigated using inhibitors to the JAK and to MEK to determine the role of the JAK STAT and MAPK kinase pathway. The JAK inhibitor could block EMT process and the MEK inhibitor was unable to block the EMT process . The conclusion was made that the JAK STAT pathway plays a more critical role for ability of CFPAC 1 cells to undergo EMT.

To characterize EMT in CFPAC 1 cells on the single cell level expression of E cadherin and vimentin in HGF OSM and HGF OSM treated cells compared to untreated cells was examined. The untreated population showed E cadherin membrane localization at cell cell junctions with some cells expressing low levels of vimentin. In cell populations treated with HGF or OSM alone most cells grew as isolated cells but some small clusters remained. The majority of cells showed strong vimentin staining with no E cadherin. In cells that did express E cadherin it was localized in the cytoplasm where it is considered non functional. Cells that were treated with HGF OSM ligand treatment showed fewer clusters than the single ligand treated populations and fewer E cadherin positive cells.

To more fully characterize the transcriptional changes observed in this model mRNA changes in a panel of established EMT genes were quantified Table 3 . We looked for gene expression changes greater than 3 fold after 1 and 7 days of ligand treatment to distinguish early and late changes. Other than E cadherin there were no changes in expression of the epithelial genes that were examined. Integrin 3 was the most consistently changed mesenchymal gene. The EMT transcription factors that were upregulated in this model were TWIST ZEB 1 and ZEB2.

To further characterize phenotypic changes associated with EMT in CFPAC1 cells the doubling time of cells after 7 day ligand treatment was determined since a slower growth rate is a characteristic of mesenchymal cells Table 4 . HGF treatment did not increase the doubling time of the cells but OSM treatment did result in an increase of approximately 50 . HGF OSM ligand treatment also increased doubling time but the difference was not distinguishable from OSM alone.

Cells were grown suspended in a Matrigel matrix to examine the effects of EMT in a 3D environment where cells are allowed to form contacts with the extracellular matrix. After 14 days in culture with or without HGF OSM the cultures were fixed and the cells immunostained for E cadherin and vimentin and with a nuclear stain to distinguish colony architecture . Untreated colonies consisted of multiple round nodules attached together with approximately 40 of the colonies showing hollow centers in some of the nodules. The colonies showed membrane E cadherin staining with low levels of vimentin in some cells. When cells were grown in the presence of HGF OSM the colony architecture became less organized with almost all colonies showing cells growing in the center and increased vimentin staining.

It was determined whether CFPAC I cells underwent EMT in vivo. Untreated cells were implanted orthotopically and evaluated over time for EMT status by western blotting qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The orthotopic tumors showed a gradual time dependent decrease in E cadherin protein and mRNA levels from week 2 to week 8 . Conversely the tumors showed an increase in vimentin protein and mRNA from week 2 to week 8. Serial sections of the orthotopic tumors demonstrated that the tumors contain a mixture of cells with expression of E cadherin vimentin or both . Groupings of cells within the tumors arrows may express 1 E cadherin but not vimentin 2 Vimentin but not E cadherin or 3 both vimentin and Ecadherin. The loss of E cadherin and gain of vimentin is a classical characteristic of EMT. However during the EMT process cells may express both markers perhaps representing cells which have undergone partial or incomplete EMT. Thus CFPAC tumors consist of cells which are potentially in all three stages of EMT. Over time more cells in the tumor may progress through the EMT process to change the overall status of the tumor as shown by the global decrease in E cadherin and increase in vimentin when using whole tumor analysis of protein or mRNA. This CFPAC 1 orthotopic animal model may be used in the identification or characterization of new pharmacological agents that inhibit tumor cells from undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and thus have potential value as anti cancer agents.
