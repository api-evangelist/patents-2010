The present invention relates to an ultrasonic inspection method and an ultrasonic inspection device. The invention more particularly relates to an ultrasonic inspection method in which an array type ultrasonic probe is used and an ultrasonic inspection device that includes an array type ultrasonic probe.

In recent years constructional materials and the like are inspected by an ultrasonic inspection method. Such a method having being developed more accurately generates an image inside of an object to be inspected in a short time to inspect the inside of the object as typified by a phased array method and an aperture synthesis method refer to for example Non Patent Document 1 Digital signal processing series volume 12 Digital signal processing with measurement sensor pp 143 186 issued by Shokodo written by Michimasa Kondo Yukimasa Ohashi and Akio Jitsumori .

The phased array method is based on a principle in which an array type ultrasonic probe having a plurality of piezoelectric elements is used and wavefronts of ultrasonic waves transmitted from the piezoelectric elements interfere with each other to form a synthesized wavefront that propagates. Thus in the phased array method timings of transmission of ultrasonic waves from the piezoelectric elements are controlled to delay so that timing of each transmission is shifted thereby enabling control on incident angles of the ultrasonic waves and also focusing of the ultrasonic waves.

For reception of ultrasonic waves incident angles of ultrasonic waves that are reflected and received by the piezoelectric elements are shifted in timing and is summed thereby enabling control on the incident angles to be formed when the ultrasonic waves are received and also reception of the ultrasonic waves in focused state as is the case with the transmission.

A linear scanning method and a sector scanning method are generally known as the phased array method. The linear scanning method is such that piezoelectric elements for a one dimensional array probe linearly scan an object to be inspected. The sector scanning method is such that a direction in which an ultrasonic wave is transmitted or received is changed within a fan shaped region. If a two dimensional array probe that has piezoelectric elements arranged in a matrix pattern is used ultrasonic waves can be three dimensionally focused on any position and thereby scanning suitable for an object to be inspected can be performed. Each of the two methods allows ultrasonic waves to be scanned at high speed without moving the ultrasonic probe. Also each of the two methods allows incident angles of ultrasonic waves and the vertical position at a focal point thereof to be controlled without replacing the ultrasonic probe. These methods are techniques which enable inspection to be performed at high speed with high accuracy.

The aperture synthesis method is based on the following principle when a piezoelectric element transmits an ultrasonic wave in such a manner that the ultrasonic wave spreads in an object to be inspected and the piezoelectric element receives the reflected ultrasonic wave a defect that is the source from which the received reflected ultrasonic wave derives is present on a circular arc that has a center thereof at the position of the piezoelectric element that transmitted and received the ultrasonic wave and has a radius of a distance that the reflected ultrasonic wave propagates. The piezoelectric element transmits an ultrasonic wave and receives the reflected ultrasonic wave while the position of the piezoelectric element is sequentially changed. The ultrasonic waves received by the piezoelectric element at the positions are calculated by an electronic computer so that the ultrasonic waves are represented by circular arcs. Intersections on the circular arcs are concentrated at the position of a defect that is the source from which the reflected ultrasonic waves derive whereby the position of the defect is specified. The details of the calculation performed by the electronic computer are described in Non Patent Document 1.

In the methods in which a probe that has a plurality of piezoelectric elements is used the probe can three dimensionally receive an ultrasonic wave signal reflected from a defect without a movement of the probe. However in order to specify the three dimensional position of the defect on the basis of the reflected ultrasonic wave signal the three dimensional position of the defect is estimated on the basis of a two dimensional image having multiple reflection intensity distributions of waves reflected at locations that are spatially different from each other. Alternatively the three dimensional position of the defect is estimated by converting the reflection intensity distributions into three dimensional data and then three dimensionally displaying the three dimensional data.

When the linear scanning method and the sector scanning method based on phased array methods are adopted multiple two dimensional reflection intensity images responsive to known scanning pitches can be acquired. Thus a direction in which a reflected ultrasonic wave appears can be specified by sequentially selectively displaying the two dimensional reflection intensity images on a screen. However these methods have limitations when three dimensional scanning other than the aforementioned scanning is performed.

To cope with this advancement in computer technology in recent years has made available a technique for performing interpolation on ultrasonic wave signals reflected and received from multiple directions so that image data that indicates points three dimensionally arranged in a matrix pattern is generated and displaying the image data by volume rendering or surface rendering. In addition there is a technique for displaying an image as a three dimensional point group without conversion of the reflected ultrasonic wave signals into data that indicates points arranged in a matrix pattern. Since the techniques are designed such that the data is stored as three dimensional inspection data an inspector can confirm the three dimensional inspection data in any direction after the measurement refer to for example Non Patent Document 2 Development of 3 Dimensional Ultrasonic Testing System 3D Focus UT Japan Society of Maintenology The fifth scientific lecture meeting Summary report 155 2008 written by Atsushi Baba So Kitazawa Naoyuki Kono Yuji Adachi Mitsuru Odakura and Osamu Kikuchi and Non Patent Document 3 Potts A McNab A. Reilly D. Toft M. Presentation and analysis enhancements of the NDT Workbench a software package for ultrasonic NDT data REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN QUANTITATIVE NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION Volume 19. AIP Conference Proceedings Volume 509 pp. 741 748 2000 .

However it is difficult to determine only on the basis of such three dimensional inspection data whether or not a wave that corresponds to a peak of a reflection intensity distribution is a wave reflected on an end surface or boundary surface of an object to be inspected or is a wave reflected on a defect. Especially it is difficult even for an experienced inspector to make such a determination for inspection of an object having a complex shape since reflected ultrasonic wave signals shape echoes dependent on the shape of the object appear in great numbers. Thus software has been developed that allows data three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional shape of an object to be inspected to be displayed together with three dimensional inspection data. By overlapping and comparing the two types of the data using this software it is possible to easily determine whether an ultrasonic wave signal is a shape echo or an echo defect echo generated from a defect. Data generated by a general purposed computer aided design CAD system is read and used for three dimensional shape data in many cases refer to for example Non Patent Documents 2 and 3 .

However the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are generated using different coordinate systems. In order to overlap and display the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data it is necessary to perform positioning correction by moving the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data to an appropriate position on a display screen. If the correction is not appropriately performed it is not possible to confirm the correlation between the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data. Thus it is not possible to identify a shape echo and a defect echo. In a conventional technique an inspector performs a positioning correction operation using a display device so as to change coordinate values of the three dimensional inspection data and coordinate values of the three dimensional shape data on the basis of numerical information on the relative positions of a probe and an object to be inspected . This operation is repeatedly performed until identification of a shape echo and a defect echo can be attained it disadvantageously takes much time to identify the echoes.

Especially in a case where the numerical information on the relative positions of the probe and the object to be inspected is not provided a problem arises that is how to adjust the positions of the probe and the object to be inspected. The case is for example that a welded part located inside a pressure container included in a boiling water reactor BWR is inspected from an outer surface of the pressure container. A cylindrical structure which is called a core shroud is provided in a central region of the pressure container of the BWR in order to hold a steam water separator and a steam dryer which are located on the upper side of the pressure container so as to surround reactor core. The core shroud is held on the lower side of the pressure container by a ring shaped structure called a shroud support. Further the shroud support is welded and fixed to the pressure container. In recent years a problem arose that is about countermeasures to be taken against light water reactors that are in a operating condition for a long passage of time in Japan. As the countermeasures the importance of nondestructive inspection of structures in reactors with ultrasonic waves has been increased. For example it is necessary to inspect whether or not a crack or the like is generated in a welded part between a shroud support and a pressure container. In general the pressure container is filled with light water and structures are provided at a high density in a reactor. Thus it is difficult to inspect the welded part from the inside of the pressure container. Therefore a technique for inspecting with ultrasonic waves a welded part from an outer surface of a pressure container has been proposed. In the technique as mentioned above the efficiency of inspection is significantly improved by displaying three dimensional inspection data acquired by a probe placed on the outer surface of the pressure container together with CAD data on the pressure container and the shroud support since this allows discrimination easy between a shape echo and a defect echo. The position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the CAD data is required to be performed with millimeter accuracy on a display screen. However it is not possible to detect with millimeter accuracy the position of the probe relative to the position of the welded part located inside the large pressure container.

An object of the present invention is to provide an ultrasonic inspection method and an ultrasonic inspection device which allow position adjustment of three dimensional inspection data and three dimensional shape data to be appropriately performed on a display screen thereby allowing identification of a defect echo and a shape echo quickly performed even when information on the relative positions of a probe and an object to be inspected is not provided.

The configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to a first embodiment of the present invention are described below with reference to .

First the entire configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device according to the first embodiment is described with reference to .

The ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment includes an array type ultrasonic probe a transmitting and receiving unit and a display unit . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits ultrasonic waves so that the ultrasonic waves are incident on an object to be inspected. The display unit displays received signal and an image inspection image on the object to be inspected.

As shown in the array type ultrasonic probe includes a plurality of piezoelectric elements that each generate and receive an ultrasonic wave. The array type ultrasonic probe is placed on a surface hereinafter also referred to as an inspection surface of the object to be inspected. After that the array type ultrasonic probe receives driving signals from the transmitting and receiving unit and generates ultrasonic waves on the basis of the driving signals. Then the array type ultrasonic probe causes the generated ultrasonic waves to propagate in the object to be inspected. The array type ultrasonic probe detects as received signals the waves reflected from the object . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits the received signals to the transmitting and receiving unit . In the array type ultrasonic probe is in direct contact with the object to be inspected. However the array type ultrasonic probe may be in contact with the object through a wedge made of a material through which an ultrasonic wave can pass.

The transmitting and receiving unit causes the array type ultrasonic probe to transmit and receive ultrasonic waves. The transmitting and receiving unit includes a calculator A a delay time controller B a pulser C a receiver D and a data storage unit E. The pulser C supplies driving signals to the array type ultrasonic probe . The receiver D processes signals transmitted from the array type ultrasonic probe .

The calculator A basically includes a CPU A a RAM A and a ROM A. A program that controls the CPU A is written in the ROM A. The CPU A reads necessary external data from the data storage unit E according to the program written in the ROM A. In addition the CPU A receives data from the RAM A executes arithmetic processing on the received data and outputs the processed data to the data storage unit E.

The CPU A controls the delay time controller B the pulser C and the receiver D so that the delay time controller B the pulser C and the receiver D perform necessary operations. The delay time controller B controls the timings of outputting driving signals from the pulser C and the timings of inputting received signals to the receiver D. Thus the array type ultrasonic probe can perform an operation according to a phased array method.

The operation that is performed by the array type ultrasonic probe according to the phased array method is an operation of controlling incident angles of ultrasonic waves and the depth of a point at which the ultrasonic waves are focused transmitting the ultrasonic waves and receiving the reflected ultrasonic waves . Thus the receiver D receives signals from the array type ultrasonic probe and supplies the received signals to the data storage unit E.

As described above in phased array methods various types of scanning can be performed by changing delay times. A linear scanning method in which the ultrasonic waves propagate in parallel in order to acquire two dimensional inspection data is known as one of the phased array methods. In addition a sector scanning method in which the ultrasonic waves propagate within a sector is known as another one of the phased array methods.

For example as shown in scanning is performed to acquire three dimensional inspection data so that the sector is treated as a basic unit and rotated around a central axis of the probe . In addition as shown in scanning is performed to acquire three dimensional inspection data so that the sector is moved in a fan shaped region. Various types of scanning other than the linear scanning and the sector scanning can be performed on the basis of the shape of the object to be inspected.

Signals that are received by performing those types of scanning are transmitted to the data storage unit E stored in the data storage unit E as stored data and transmitted to the calculator A. The calculator A performs on the basis of delay times synthesis processing on the waveforms of the signals received by the piezoelectric elements performs appropriate interpolation on the waveforms of the signals for the incident angles of the respective ultrasonic waves and generates two dimensional inspection data pixel format inspection data including a two dimensional square lattice as a unit or three dimensional inspection data voxel format inspection data including a three dimensional square lattice as a unit . Then the calculator A converts the generated data into an image and causes the display unit to display the image.

The display unit includes a two dimensional display screen B a three dimensional display screen C and a waveform display screen A. The two dimensional inspection data is displayed on the two dimensional display screen B. The three dimensional inspection data is displayed on the three dimensional display screen C. The waveform signals of the ultrasonic waves received by the piezoelectric elements are displayed on the waveform display screen A. In the ultrasonic inspection device includes one display unit . However the waveform display screen A the two dimensional display screen B and the three dimensional display screen C may be included in display units respectively. In this case the display units are separately provided in the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment.

As shown in three dimensional inspection data is displayed on the three dimensional display screen C included in the display unit . A mouse F and a keyboard G are connected to the calculator A. Data can be entered into the calculator A by means of the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the size of an image of the three dimensional inspection data on the display screen is increased or reduced to any size. In addition data can be entered into the calculator A by means of the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the color and transparency of the image of the three dimensional inspection data are optionally changed. The color of the image on the display screen can be changed according to a reflection intensity of wave. In this case an inspector can select a color pattern from among multiple color patterns on the basis of the purpose of use.

Three dimensional writing algorithms that are used to display the three dimensional inspection data are achieved in libraries such as OpenGL registered trademark and DirectX registered trademark . OpenGL and DirectX are industry standard graphics application programming interfaces graphics APIs for graphics applications. When the graphics APIs are used in a program and necessary information such as the shape of an object to be displayed a viewpoint and the position of the object to be displayed is provided the position color transparency and size of the image of the three dimensional inspection data can be selected and the three dimensional inspection data can be displayed on the three dimensional display screen C.

As shown in the display unit can simultaneously display the three dimensional inspection data and three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional display screen C. The three dimensional shape data indicates the shape of the object to be inspected. The inspector can use the mouse F or the keyboard G and enter data so that the color and transparency of an image of the three dimensional shape data are changed. In addition the inspector can enter a value by using the keyboard G or drag the three dimensional shape data by using the mouse F so that the three dimensional shape data can be moved in parallel or rotated on the three dimensional display screen C. In addition the inspector can switch between displaying of the three dimensional shaped data and hiding of the three dimensional shaped data when necessary. Thus the inspector can easily view the three dimensional inspection data even when the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data overlap each other.

When CAD data on the object to be inspected is present as the three dimensional shape data the CAD data can be read from the outside of the calculator A to be displayed. The format of the CAD data is a data format that allows the CAD data to be input and output by commercially available CAD software. For example the format of the CAD data is stereolithography STL format or stand triangulated language STL format. STL formats allow the CAD data to be input and output by many types of CAD software. The format of the CAD data is STL format and represents surfaces of an object by using a group of many triangles. Surface normal vectors of the triangles and coordinate values of the three corners of each of the triangles are written in a STL file. The three dimensional shape data can be easily read from the STL file and displayed using the graphics APIs by writing multiple triangles.

As shown in in general coordinate systems of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are different from each other. Thus each pieces of data are displayed at different positions on the three dimensional display screen C in a initial condition. The inspector can control by trial and error by using the keyboard G to enter values or using the mouse F so that the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are located at desired positions on the three dimensional display screen C. Though this operation takes a long time and a lot of trouble an automatic position adjustment process according to the present invention makes this operation easier. In addition even when information on the relative positions of the probe and the object to be inspected is not provided in such a case as described as inspection from the outer surface of the pressure container included in the BWR is required automatic position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data is possible.

The process of automatic position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data shown in and the three dimensional shape data shown in is described below in detail.

In general in order to appropriately perform position adjustment of images of two data pieces a standard coordinate system is set and parallel movement and rotational movement are performed in combination with each other. Although a coordinate system of any one of the two data pieces is set as the standard coordinate system in many cases any coordinate system may be set. Note that the scale sizes of the images of the two data pieces match each other in this case. In case of parallel movement determination of a vector that indicates amount of the movement and direction of the movement is necessary. On the other hand in case of rotational movement determination of a rotational axis and a rotational angle is necessary. The automatic position adjustment process according to the present invention is as follows. Ultrasonic propagation analysis hereinafter referred to as propagation analysis is performed all over a region to be inspected on the coordinate system of the three dimensional data in the same scanning manner as a measurement by sequentially changing an ultrasonic wave incident point and an ultrasonic wave incident direction. Then after multiple propagation analysis data pieces acquired by the propagation analysis and measured waveform data pieces are sequentially compared with each other for each propagation paths the best matching combination of measured waveform data pieces and propagation analysis data pieces in which the two kinds of data pieces averagely match each other is detected in the entire three dimensional inspection data or in a specified region. Based on the ultrasonic wave incident point and the ultrasonic incident direction that have been used for the propagation analysis of the aforementioned combination the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data is moved relative to the other data. The propagation analysis widely known is also called ray tracing analysis in which reflection and refraction of ultrasonic waves are calculated on the basis of a geometric theory by means of information on the shape and material of the object to be inspected as parameters to calculate propagation paths and propagation times of the ultrasonic waves.

In addition the propagation analysis data pieces can be obtained by a finite element method or a boundary element method in addition to the ray tracing analysis. For example a sound field change in the object to be inspected with respect to time is calculated by the finite element method and changes in the amplitudes of the ultrasonic waves at the positions of the piezoelectric elements with respect to time are shifted at the same timings as that in measurement and summed. In this manner the waveform data pieces can be obtained which are similar to or the same as those obtained by the phased array method.

Next the automatic position adjustment method in which the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment is used is described with reference to .

First a first propagation analysis data piece that is calculated by an analysis calculator is read into a program executed by the calculator A in step S . The analysis may be performed by the calculator A for measurement control. The first propagation analysis data piece includes a position of a point at which an ultrasonic wave that propagates in a corresponding propagation path is reflected and refracted a direction in which the reflection and the refraction occur a distance from a point on which the ultrasonic wave is incident a time from the incidence and the like.

The propagation distance d to the peak position of the first measured waveform data piece corresponds to a distance d between an ultrasonic wave incident point In and a certain defect in the three dimensional inspection data shown in . The propagation distance d to the peak position of the first propagation analysis data piece corresponds to a distance d between an ultrasonic wave incident point In and a position at which a defect has occurred in the three dimensional shape data shown in . Note that the propagation distance is calculated on the basis of a sound velocity and the distance between the ultrasonic wave incident point and the defect. When a temperature is changed the sound velocity is also changed. Therefore when a temperature during the measurement and a temperature set before the start of the measurement are slightly different from each other the propagation distance d to the peak position of the first measured waveform data piece is different from the propagation distance d to the peak position of the first propagation analysis data piece . In addition when a difference of a set position of the array type ultrasonic probe also generates a difference mentioned above. Note that the difference is very small.

The difference d between the propagation distances can be calculated on the basis of a mutual correlation function R expressed by the following equation 1 in step S . When the first propagation analysis data piece is indicated by f and the first measured waveform data piece is indicated by g the mutual correlation function R is calculated from the following equation 1 using Fourier transform F of the first propagation analysis data piece and Fourier transform G of the first measured waveform data piece . 1 

In the equation 1 FT indicates inverse Fourier transform and F indicates a complex conjugate of F. Normally the first propagation analysis data piece and the first measured waveform data piece are discrete numerical data. Thus discrete Fourier transform is performed in order to calculate the mutual correlation function R by the calculator A. As the mutual correlation function R is calculated as a complex number it includes a real part and an imaginary part. In order to calculate the difference d between the propagation distances to the peak positions however a power spectral density function R of the mutual correlation function R is used.

Then steps S to S are performed on second and third propagation analysis data pieces so as to calculate average values day according to the second and third propagation analysis data pieces in step S . Then a propagation analysis data piece from which the smallest average value day has been calculated is specified in step S . Then an ultrasonic wave incident point and an ultrasonic wave incident direction which are set for calculation of the propagation analysis data piece from which the smallest average value day has been calculated are specified in step S .

Lastly the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data is moved on the basis of the ultrasonic wave incident point and the ultrasonic wave incident direction which are calculated in step S to perform position adjustment thereby displaying both of the data pieces on the three dimensional display screen as shown in in step S .

For example when the propagation analysis data piece from which the smallest average value day is calculated is a part of three dimensional shape data shown in and indicates that the ultrasonic wave is incident on the ultrasonic wave incident point In and propagates in an ultrasonic wave incident direction R a propagation distance d the three dimensional inspection data is moved in parallel so that the ultrasonic wave incident point In of the three dimensional shape data shown in matches an ultrasonic incident point In of the three dimensional inspection data shown in . Then the three dimensional inspection data is rotationally moved so that the ultrasonic wave incident direction R connecting the ultrasonic wave incident point In to a position at which the defect has occurred in the three dimensional shape data shown in matches an ultrasonic wave incident direction R connecting the ultrasonic wave incident point In to the position of the certain defect in the three dimensional inspection data shown in for example. In this manner the automatic position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data is performed.

As described above according to the present embodiment the three dimensional inspection data generated from the waveforms of the ultrasonic waves received by the ultrasonic probe is compared with the multiple ultrasonic propagation analysis data pieces calculated by the ray tracing method on the basis of the three dimensional shape data on the object to be inspected and the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data is automatically moved on the three dimensional display screen and displayed thereby efficiently performing an operation for determining whether an echo is a defect echo or a shape echo on the basis of the three dimensional shape data. Thus it is possible to quickly and easily specify the position of the defect in the object to be inspected.

Next the configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to a second embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to . The entire configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device according to the second embodiment is the same as that shown in .

The first embodiment describes the example of the position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data . On the other hand the second embodiment describes an example of position adjustment of the two dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data that are acquired by a linear scanning method or a sector scanning method.

As a configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device and an automatic positioning method according to the second embodiment are the same as those according to the first embodiment a description thereof is omitted. However since the two dimensional inspection data is output as image data of a pixel format or the like a method for displaying results obtained after the position adjustment is different from that according to the first embodiment.

When the sector and the three dimensional shape data are displayed in the aforementioned manner the inspector can easily confirm a cross section of the object to be inspected to which the sector corresponds. Though shows the example in which only one sector is displayed images of multiple sectors may be simultaneously displayed on the screen. An algorithm for three dimensionally displaying the planar image is achieved by the aforementioned graphics APIs. Therefore by using the graphics APIs in a program providing necessary information such as dimensions of the planar image to be displayed a viewpoint and a position of a planar image on the display screen and the like is provided the planar image can be easily and three dimensionally displayed on the three dimensional display screen C together with the three dimensional shape data at an arbitrary position.

Next a configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to a third embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to . The entire configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device according to the third embodiment is the same as that shown in .

As described above according to the present embodiment the two dimensional inspection data that is generated from the waveforms of the multiple ultrasonic waves received by the ultrasonic probe is compared with the ultrasonic propagation analysis data pieces calculated by the ray tracing method on the basis of the three dimensional shape data on the object to be inspected and the three dimensional shape data or the two dimensional inspection data is automatically moved relative to the other data thereby displaying the two dimensional inspection data the two dimensional inspection data overlapped with the outline of the cross sectional image of the three dimensional shape data.

Next a configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to . The entire configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device according to the fourth embodiment is the same as that shown in .

In the fourth embodiment the array type ultrasonic probe is fixed to the moving unit by means of a fixing jig . The array type ultrasonic probe is mechanically moved by control performed by an external device and receives signals of reflected ultrasonic waves. For example the array type ultrasonic probe is used for inspection of a welded line between a shroud support and a pressure container included in a BWR. The array type ultrasonic probe can be moved freely on a pressure container in a direction extending along the welded line between the shroud support and the pressure container and in a direction perpendicular to the welded line by the moving unit . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits and receives ultrasonic signals while moving.

The basic configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device and an automatic position adjustment method according to the present embodiment are the same as those according to the first embodiment. For example when the array type ultrasonic probe moves while performing sector scanning and collecting data an image of the sector is displayed on an as needed basis as the two dimensional inspection data on the two dimensional display screen B together with the outline of the cross sectional image of the three dimensional shape data through the automatic position adjustment process according to the present invention.

In addition the array type ultrasonic probe performs sector scanning while moving so that the probe acquires a predetermined number of images of sectors. After that the calculator A generates three dimensional inspection data performs the automatic position adjustment process according to the present invention and then causes the three dimensional inspection data to be displayed on an as needed basis together with the three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional display screen C. According to the present embodiment the display results can be confirmed while echoes and the shape of the object to be inspected are simultaneously displayed thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the inspection.

As described above according to the present embodiment the ultrasonic inspection device includes the moving unit that is fixed to the ultrasonic probe and moves the ultrasonic probe in any direction. Further the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment can display the inspection data overlapped with the three dimensional shape data.
