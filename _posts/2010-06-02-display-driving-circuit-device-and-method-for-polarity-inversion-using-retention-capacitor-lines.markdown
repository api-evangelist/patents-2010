The present invention relates to driving of display devices such as liquid crystal display devices having active matrix liquid crystal display panels and in particular to a display driving circuit and a display driving method for driving a display panel in a display device employing a drive system referred to as CC charge coupling driving.

A conventional CC driving system that is employed in an active matrix liquid crystal display device is disclosed for example in Patent Literature 1 Japanese Patent Application Publication Tokukai No. 2001 83943 . CC driving is explained by taking as an example the content of disclosure in Patent Literature 1.

As shown in the liquid crystal display device that carries out CC driving includes an image display section a source line driving circuit a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit .

The image display section includes a plurality of source lines signal lines a plurality of gate lines scanning lines switching elements pixel electrodes a plurality of CS capacity storage bus lines common electrode lines retention capacitors liquid crystals and a counter electrode . The switching elements are disposed near points of intersection between the plurality of source lines and the plurality of gate lines respectively. The pixel electrodes are connected to the switching elements respectively.

The CS bus lines are paired with the gate lines respectively and arrange in parallel with one another. Each of the retention capacitors has one end connected to a pixel electrode and the other end connected to a CS bus line . The counter electrode is provided in such a way as to face the pixel electrodes with the liquid crystals sandwiched therebetween.

The source line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the source lines and the gate line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the gate lines . Further the CS bus line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the CS bus lines .

Each of the switching elements is formed by amorphous silicon a Si polycrystalline silicon p Si monocrystalline silicon c Si and the like. Because of such a structure a capacitor is formed between the gate and the drain of the switching element . This capacitor causes a phenomenon in which a gate pulse from a gate line shifts the electric potential of a pixel electrode toward a negative side.

As shown in the electric potential Vg of a gate line in the liquid crystal display device is Von only during an H period horizontal scanning period in which the gate line is selected and retained at Voff during the other periods. The electric potential Vs of a source line varies in amplitude depending on a video signal to be displayed but takes a waveform that reverses its polarity every H period centered on the counter electrode potential Vcom and reverses its polarity in an adjacent H period concerning the same gate line line inversion driving . Since it is assumed in that a uniform video signal is being inputted the electric potential Vs changes with constant amplitude.

The electric potential Vd of the pixel electrode is equal to the electric potential Vs of the source line because the switching element conducts during a period in which the electric potential Vg is Von and at the moment the electric potential Vg becomes Voff the electric potential Vd shifts slightly toward a negative side through the gate drain capacitor .

The electric potential Vc of a CS bus line is Ve during an H period in which the corresponding gate line is selected and the next H period. Further the electric potential Vc switches to Ve during the H period after the next and then retained at Ve until the next field. This switching causes the electric potential Vd to be shifted toward a negative side through the retention capacitor .

In the result the electric potential Vd changes with larger amplitude than the electric potential Vs therefore the amplitude of change in the electric potential Vs can be made smaller. This allows achieving a simplification of circuitry and a reduction of power consumption in the source line driving circuit .

The liquid crystal display device employing line inversion driving and CC driving has such a problem that in the first frame after the start of a display there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row every single horizontal line of the liquid crystal display device .

In GSP is a gate start pulse that defines a timing of vertical scanning and GCK CK and GCK CKB are gate clock signals that are outputted from the control circuit to define a timing of operation of the shift register. A period from a falling edge to the next falling edge in GSP corresponds to a single vertical scanning period 1V period . A period from a rising edge in GCK to a rising edge in GCK and a period from a rising edge in GCK to a rising edge in GCK each correspond to a single horizontal scanning period 1H period . CMI is a polarity signal that reverses its polarity every single horizontal scanning period.

Further shows the following signals in the order named a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source line driving circuit to a source line source line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS which is supplied from the bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and an electric potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. Similarly shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and an electric potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. Furthermore shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the third row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the third row and an electric potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the third row and the xth column.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the electric potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix indicate the electric potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. In the initial state the source line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are all in the preparatory stages or in a resting state before entering into normal operation. Therefore the gate signals G G and G are fixed at a gate off potential electric potential at which the gate of a switching element is turned off and the CS signals CS CS and CS are fixed at one electric potential e.g. at a low level .

In the first frame after the initial state the source line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are all in normal operation. This causes the source signal S to be a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 1H period.

It should be noted that since it is assumed in that a uniform picture is displayed the amplitude of the source signal S is constant. Meanwhile the gate signals G G and G serve as gate on potentials at which the gates of the switching elements are turned on during the first second and third 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS CS and CS are reversed after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall and take such waveforms that they are opposite in direction of reversal to one another. Specifically in an odd numbered frame the CS signal CS rises after its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall. Further in an even numbered frame the CS signal CS falls after its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall.

It should be noted that the relationship between rising and falling edges in the CS signals CS CS and CS in the odd numbered and even numbered frames may be opposite of the relationship stated above. Further the timing of reversal of the CS signals CS CS and CS may be the falling edges in the gate signals G G and G or later i.e. the corresponding horizontal scanning periods or later. For example the CS signals CS CS and CS may be reversed in synchronization with rising edges in gate signals in the next row.

However since in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level in the initial state the electric potentials Vpix and Vpix are placed in an irregular state. Specifically the CS signal CS behaves in the same way as in the other odd numbered frames third fifth frame . . . in that it rises after the corresponding gate signal G falls but the CS signals CS and CS behave differently from the other odd numbered frames third fifth frame . . . in that they are retained at the same electric potential in at a low level after the corresponding gate signals G and G fall.

For this reason in the first frame there occurs a change in electric potential of the CS signal CS as usual in the pixel electrodes in the second row. Therefore while the electric potential Vpix is subjected to an electric potential shift caused by a change in electric potential of the CS signal CS there occur no changes in electric potential of the CS signals CS and CS in the pixel electrodes in the first and third rows. Accordingly the electric potentials Vpix and Vpix are not subjected to an electric potential shift as indicated by shaded areas in . In the result despite inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale there occurs a difference in luminance between the first and third rows and the second row due to a difference between the electric potentials Vpix and Vpix and the electric potential Vpix. This difference in luminance appears as a difference in luminance between an odd numbered row and an even numbered row in the image display section as a whole. Therefore there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row in a picture in the first frame.

A technology capable of suppressing the appearance of such transverse stripes is disclosed in Patent Literature 2. The technology of Patent Literature 2 is described below with reference to . is a block diagram showing a configuration of driving circuits a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit shown in Patent Literature 2. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals of a liquid crystal display device. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit.

As shown in the CS bus line driving circuit has a plurality of CS circuits . . . corresponding to their respective rows. The CS circuits . . . include D latch circuits . . . and OR circuits . . . respectively. In the following description the CS circuits and which correspond to the first and second rows respectively are taken as an example.

Input signals to the CS circuit are the gate signals G and G a polarity signal POL and a rest signal RESET and input signals to the CS circuit are the gate signals G and G the polarity signal POL and the reset signal REST. The polarity signal POL and the reset signal RESET are inputted from the control circuit not illustrated .

The OR circuit receives the gate signal G from the corresponding gate line and the gate signal G from the gate line of the next row and thereby outputs a signal g shown in . Further the OR circuit receives the gate signal G from the corresponding gate line and the gate signal G from the gate line in the next row and thereby outputs a signal g shown in .

The D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL receives the polarity signal POL via its terminal D and receives the output g via its clock terminal CK from the OR circuit . In accordance with a change in electric potential level of the signal g from a low level to a high level or from a high level to a low level that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit outputs as a CS signal CS an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal POL that it receives via its terminal D and the CS signal CS indicates the change in electric potential level. Specifically when the electric potential level of the signal g that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is a high level the latch circuit outputs an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal POL that it receives via its terminal D. When the electric potential level of the signal g that the latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK has changed from a high level to a low level the latch circuit latches the input state low level or high level of the polarity signal POL that it received via its terminal D at the time of change and keeps the latched state until the next time when the electric potential level of the signal g that the latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is raised to a high level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the latched state as the CS signal CS shown in which indicates the change in electric potential level via its terminal Q.

Further similarly the D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL receives the polarity signal POL via its terminal D and receives the output g via its clock terminal CK from the OR circuit . This allows the D latch circuit to output a CS signal CS shown in which indicates a change in electric potential level via its terminal Q.

The foregoing configuration causes the CS signals CS and CS to be different in electric potential from each other at points in time where the gate signals in the first and second rows fall. Therefore as shown in the electric potential Vpix is subjected to an electric potential shift caused by a change in electric potential of the CS signal CS and the electric potential Vpix is subjected to an electric potential shift caused by a change in electric potential of the CS signal CS. This allows eliminating such alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row as those shown in .

However the technology disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is premised on line 1H inversion driving by which the polarity of the voltage of a pixel electrode is reversed every single row single line single horizontal scanning period . That is driving is carried out so that the electric potential of a CS signal varies every single line. Therefore the electric potential of a CS signal cannot be made to vary for example every two rows. This causes such a problem that when this driving method is applied to a display device which carries out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution e.g. displays a double size picture there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture.

The following description discusses why transverse stripes appear when resolution conversion driving is carried out. a of shows i display pictures displayed during normal driving and ii polarities of signal potentials supplied to pixel electrodes corresponding to the display pictures. b of shows i the display picture shown in the upper left area enclosed by a dotted line in a of and ii polarities of signal potentials supplied to the pixel electrodes as observed in a case where the resolution of the corresponding video signal has been converted by a factor of 2 both in the row wise and column wise directions i.e. double size display .

The resolution conversion driving is carried out such that depending on the conversion factor signals having the same polarity and the same electric potential gray scale are supplied to a plurality of pixels adjacent to each other in the column wise direction scanning direction . For example in the case of a double size display i a source signal S supplied to the pixel electrode of the pixel located in the third row and the second column shown in a of and ii a source signal S supplied to the pixel electrode of each of the pixels located in the fifth and sixth rows and the third and fourth columns shown in b of are equal in polarity which is here a negative polarity and electric potential gray scale to each other.

The above example is a case where the conversion factor is of a double size. However also in a case where the conversion factor is of a triple size or the resolution has been converted only in the column wise direction there will undesirably appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture.

That is according to a conventional technique in a case where a liquid crystal display device that employs CC driving carries out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution i.e. carries out an n fold display n is an integer of two or greater a problem arises in which there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture.

The present invention has been made in view of the problem and an object of the present invention is to provide a display driving circuit and a display driving method each employing CC driving which display driving circuit and display driving method are capable of improving display quality by eliminating appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes that appear in a display picture when a display is carried out based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution.

A display driving circuit in accordance with the present invention is a display driving circuit for use in a display device i which carries out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution and ii in which by supplying retention capacitor wire signals to retention capacitor wires forming capacitors with pixel electrodes included in pixels signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from data signal lines are changed in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials wherein assuming that a direction in which scanning signal lines extend is a row wise direction when the resolution of the video signal is converted by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in a column wise direction signal potentials having the same polarity and the same gray scale are supplied to pixel electrodes included in respective n pixels that correspond to n adjacent scanning signal lines and that are adjacent to each other in the column wise direction and a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from the data signal lines varies every n adjacent rows according to the polarities of the signal potentials.

According to the display driving circuit signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes are changed by the retention capacitor wire signals in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials. This realizes CC driving. Further according to the display driving circuit a display is carried out based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in the column wise direction. This realizes high resolution conversion driving n fold display driving .

Further according to the configuration a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from the data signal lines varies every n adjacent rows according to the polarities of the signal potentials. For example in a case of carrying out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of 2 double size display driving in both the column wise and row wise directions a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes varies every two adjacent rows. This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture see . Accordingly it is possible to eliminate appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture when a display device employing CC driving carries out high resolution conversion driving n fold display driving and thus possible to improve display quality of the display device.

A display device in accordance with the present invention includes any one of the foregoing display driving circuits and a display panel.

A display driving method in accordance with the present invention is a method for driving a display device i which carries out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution and ii in which by supplying retention capacitor wire signals to retention capacitor wires forming capacitors with pixel electrodes included in pixels signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from data signal lines are changed in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials said method including when the resolution of the video signal is converted by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in a column wise direction supplying signal potentials having the same polarity and the same gray scale to pixel electrodes included in respective n pixels that correspond to n adjacent scanning signal lines and that are adjacent to each other in the column wise direction assuming that a direction in which scanning signal lines extend is a row wise direction and causing a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from the data signal lines to vary every n adjacent rows according to the polarities of the signal potentials.

The display driving method can bring about the same effects as those brought about by the configuration of the display driving circuit.

As has been described a display driving circuit and a display driving method in accordance with the present invention are each configured such that in a case where a display is carried out by CC driving based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of n at least in a column wise direction a direction of change in signal potentials written to pixel electrodes from data signal lines varies every n adjacent rows depending on the polarities of the signal potentials. This allows a display device employing CC driving to eliminate appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes that appear in a display picture when carrying out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of n and to improve display quality.

First a configuration of a liquid crystal display device corresponding to a display device of the present invention is described with reference to . is a block diagram showing an overall configuration of the liquid crystal display device and is an equivalent circuit diagram showing an electrical configuration of each pixel of the liquid crystal display device .

The liquid crystal display device includes an active matrix liquid crystal display panel which corresponds to a display panel of the present invention a source bus line driving circuit which corresponds to a data signal line driving circuit of the present invention a gate line driving circuit which corresponds to a scanning signal line driving circuit of the present invention a CS bus line driving circuit which corresponds to a retention capacitor wire driving circuit of the present invention and a control circuit which corresponds to a control circuit of the present invention.

The liquid crystal display panel constituted by sandwiching liquid crystals between an active matrix substrate and a counter substrate not illustrated has a large number of pixels P arranged in rows and columns.

Moreover the liquid crystal display panel includes source bus lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to data signal lines of the present invention gate lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to scanning signal lines of the present invention thin film transistors hereinafter referred to as TFTs provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to switching element of the present invention pixel electrodes provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to pixel electrodes of the present invention CS bus lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to retention capacitor wires of the present invention and a counter electrode provided on the counter substrate. It should be noted that each of the TFTs omitted from is shown in alone.

The source bus lines are arranged one by one in columns in parallel with one another along a column wise direction longitudinal direction and the gate lines are arranged one by one in rows in parallel with one another along a row wise direction transverse direction . The TFTs are each provided in correspondence with a point of intersection between a source bus line and a gate line so are the pixel electrodes . Each of the TFTs has its source electrode s connected to the source bus line its gate electrode g connected to the gate line and its drain electrode d connected to a pixel electrode . Further each of the pixel electrode forms a liquid crystal capacitor with the counter electrode with liquid crystals sandwiched between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode .

With this when a gate signal scanning signal supplied to the gate line causes the gate of the TFT to be on and a source signal data signal from the source bus line is written to the pixel electrode the pixel electrode is given an electric potential corresponding to the source signal. In the result the electric potential corresponding to the source signal is applied to the liquid crystals sandwiched between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode . This allows realization of a gray scale display corresponding to the source signal.

The CS bus lines are arranged one by one in rows in parallel with one another along a row wise direction transverse direction in such a way as to be paired with the gate lines respectively. The CS bus lines each form a retention capacitor referred to also as auxiliary capacitor with each one of the pixel electrodes arranged in each row thereby being capacitively coupled to the pixel electrodes .

It should be noted that since because of its structure the TFT has a pull in capacitor formed between the gate electrode g and the drain electrode d the electric potential of the pixel electrode is affected pulled in by a change in electric potential of the gate line . However for simplification of explanation such an effect is not taken into consideration here.

The liquid crystal display panel thus configured is driven by the source bus line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit . Further the control circuit supplies the source bus line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit with various signals that are necessary for driving the liquid crystal display panel .

In the present embodiment during an active period effective scanning period in a vertical scanning period that is periodically repeated each row is allotted a horizontal scanning period in sequence and scanned in sequence. For that purpose in synchronization with a horizontal scanning period in each row the gate line driving circuit sequentially outputs a gate signal for turning on the TFTs to the gate line in that row. The gate line driving circuit will be described in detail later.

The source bus line driving circuit outputs a source signal to each source bus line . This source signal is obtained by the source bus line driving circuit receiving a video signal from an outside of the liquid crystal display device via the control circuit allotting the video signal to each column and giving the video signal a boost or the like.

Further in order to carry out so called n line nH inversion driving the source bus line driving circuit is configured such that the polarity of the source signal it outputs is i identical for all pixels in an identical row and reversed every n adjacent lines and ii reversed in synchronization with vertical scanning periods. For example as shown in which shows timings of 2 line 2H inversion driving the polarity of a source signal S during the horizontal scanning periods in the first and second rows is reverse to the polarity of the source signal S during the horizontal scanning periods in the third and fourth rows. Further the polarity of the source signal S during the horizontal scanning period in the first row in the first frame is reverse to the polarity of the source signal S during the horizontal scanning period in the first row in the second frame. That is in the case of the n line nH inversion driving the source signal S reverses its polarity polarity of an electric potential of a pixel electrode every n lines n rows .

Further in order to carry out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of n to higher resolution at least in the column wise direction the source bus line driving circuit supplies signal potentials having the same polarity and the same gray scale every n rows n lines . For example in a case of carrying out a display based on a video signal whose resolution as been converted by a factor of 2 in both the column wise and row wise directions source signals S supplied to the first and second rows have the same voltage polarity and the same gray scale whereas source signals S supplied to the third and fourth rows have the same voltage polarity and the same gray scale. It should be noted that although the following description assumes that one row one line corresponds to one horizontal scanning period this does not imply any limitation on the present invention.

The CS bus line driving circuit outputs a CS signal corresponding to a retention capacitor wire signal of the present invention to each CS bus line . This CS signal is a signal whose electric potential switches rises or falls between two values high and low electric potential levels and is controlled such that the electric potential at a point in time where the TFTs in the corresponding row are switched from on to off i.e. at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every n adjacent lines. The CS bus line driving circuit will be described in detail later.

The control circuit controls the gate line driving circuit the source bus line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit thereby causing each of them to output signals as shown in .

The liquid crystal display device having the above configuration is configured to i convert resolution of a video signal by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in the column wise direction and ii carry out n line inversion driving. Although the liquid crystal display device in accordance with the present embodiment is configured to covert resolution of a video signal by a factor of n both in the column wise and row wise directions this does not imply any limitation. Therefore the liquid crystal display device can be configured to convert the resolution by a factor of n only in the column wise direction. In the following an embodiment in which a display is carried out based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor n both in the column wise and row wise directions n fold size display driving is taken as an example.

Further shows the following signals in the order named a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source bus line driving circuit to a source bus line source bus line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS which is supplied from the bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and an electric potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and an electric potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the third row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the third row and an electric potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the third row and the xth column. As to the fourth and fifth rows similarly shows a gate signal G a CS signal CS and an electric potential waveform Vpix in the order named and a gate signal G a CS signal CS and an electric potential waveform Vpix in the order named.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the electric potentials Vpix Vpix Vpix Vpix and Vpix indicate the electric potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G which corresponds to the output SRO from the corresponding shift register circuit SR falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every two horizontal scanning period 2H . The source signal S has the same electric potential gray scale during two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H and has the same electric potential gray scale during next two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials gray scales of a negative polarity AA during the first and second horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the third and fourth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first and second horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the third and fourth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to fifth 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively.

Thus in the liquid crystal display device that employs double size display driving the electric potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every two rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S therefore in the first frame the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Therefore inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative electric potential differences between the electric potential of the counter electrode and the shifted electric potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal having a negative polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to two adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal having a positive polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to two adjacent pixels next to the two rows in the same column of pixels the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the first two rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the first two rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the next two rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the next two rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This realizes 2 line inversion driving in CC driving.

Moreover the foregoing configuration allows the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes to be properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively even in a case of double size display driving 2 line inversion driving . This allows pixel electrodes that are supplied with the same signal potential to be equal in electric potential to each other thus making it possible to eliminate the appearance of transverse stripes shown in .

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

The gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit may be located on respective different sides of the liquid crystal display panel.

Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and a reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. As described above each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next row and receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every row. The polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities every two horizontal scanning periods and are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period refer to . The polarity signals CMI and CMI and the reset signal RESET are supplied from the control circuit .

In the following for convenience of description mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second and third rows respectively are taken as an example.

The D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL receives the polarity signal CMI retention target signal via its data terminal D second input section and receives an output from the OR circuit via its clock terminal CK first input section . In accordance with a change from a low level to a high level or from a high level to a low level in electric potential level of the signal that it receives via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit outputs as a CS signal CS indicative of the change in electric potential level an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it receives via its data terminal D.

Specifically when the electric potential level of the signal that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is at a high level the D latch circuit outputs an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it receives via its terminal D. When the electric potential level of the signal that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK has changed from a high level to a low level the latch circuit latches an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it receives via its terminal D at the time of change and keeps the latched state until the next time when the electric potential level of the signal that the latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is raised to a high level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the CS signal CS which indicates the change in electric potential level via its output terminal Q.

Similarly the D latch circuit receives the resent signal RESET via its reset terminal CL and receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D. Meanwhile the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK an output from the OR circuit . This causes the D latch circuit to output a CS signal CS which indicates a change in electric potential level via its output terminal Q output section .

The OR circuit receives the output signal SRO from the shift resister circuit SR in its corresponding row and the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in the next row and thereby outputs a signal M shown in . Further the OR circuit receives the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in its corresponding row and the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in the next row and thereby outputs a signal M shown in .

A shift register output SRO supplied to each OR circuit is generated by a well known method in the gate line driving circuit see which includes D type flip flop circuits. The gate line driving circuit sequentially shifts a gate start pulse GSP which is supplied from the control circuit to a shift register circuit SR in the next stage at a timing of the gate clock GCK having a frequency of one horizontal scanning period.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the third row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level.

That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Note that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the high level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Note that in the fourth row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

As described above each of the CS circuits . . . and corresponding to the respective rows makes it possible in each frame in 2 line inversion driving to switch the electric potential of a CS signal at a point in time where a gate signal in a corresponding row falls at a point in time where a TFT is switched from on to off between high and low levels after the gate signal in this row falls.

That is in Example 1 i a CS signal CSn supplied to the CS bus line in the nth row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal Gn in the nth row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and ii a CS signal CSn 1 supplied to the CS bus line in the n 1 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises. Further iii a CS signal CSn 2 supplied to the CS bus line in the n 2 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and iv a CS signal CSn 3 supplied to the CS bus line in the n 3 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 4 in the n 4 th row rises.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs double size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between ii the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the sings A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a positive polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . In this way the CMI and the CMI reverse their polarity every two horizontal scanning periods and are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period. Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every row. For example the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI see .

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 1 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls and the CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every three horizontal scanning period 3H . The source signal S has the same electric potential during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively.

Thus in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving the electric potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every three rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S therefore in the first frame the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Therefore inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative electric potential differences between the electric potential of the counter electrode and the shifted electric potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal having a negative polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal having a positive polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows next to the three rows in the same column of pixels the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the first three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the first three rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the next three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the next three rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This realizes 3 line inversion driving in CC driving.

Moreover the foregoing configuration allows the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes to be properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively even in a case of triple size display driving 3 line inversion driving . This allows pixel electrodes that are supplied with the same signal potential to be equal in electric potential to each other thus making it possible to eliminate the appearance of transverse stripes shown in . As a result it is possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

According to the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit of Example 2 the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarity at timings different from those in Example 1. The other configurations are the same as those shown in . Each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next row and receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every row. The polarity signals CMI and CMI are set so as to reverse their polarities at the timings shown in .

The following description discusses with reference to the liquid crystal display device which employs triple size display driving. In the following descriptions of connections in the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are omitted. shows waveforms of various signals inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 2. In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example the CS circuits and corresponding to the second third and fourth rows respectively.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the third row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Note that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO for the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the high level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

The D latch circuit then outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit a latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

By the operations as so far described i in the first to third rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to fall after the gate signals in these rows fall and ii in the fourth to six rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to rise after the gate signals in these rows fall see .

As has been described according to Example 2 3H inversion driving can be carried out by adjusting in the liquid crystal display device configured as shown in timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the sings A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a negative polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every row. For example the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 1 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As has been described in Examples 1 and 2 even according to the liquid crystal display device shown in FIG. 2H inversion driving and 3H inversion driving can be carried out by using two polarity signals CMI and CMI that reverse their polarities at the same time or at respective different timings. Similarly 4H . . . and nH n line inversion driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows carrying out double size display driving and triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

Examples 1 and 2 each discuss a configuration in which a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. Note however that the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is not limited to this. For example as shown in the liquid crystal display device can be configured such that the CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row. That is the CS circuit receives the shift register output SRO in the corresponding row and the shift register output SRO in the third row. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals in the liquid crystal display device which is configured like above and carries out a double size display. As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 2H periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively.

This realizes 2H inversion driving and eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus improves display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and a reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Each CS circuit receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. That is as described above the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI. The polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities every two horizontal scanning periods and have the same phase. Therefore according to the present example it is possible to employ a configuration in which only one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI is used and is supplied to each CS circuit.

In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second and third rows respectively. shows waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 3.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level.

That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

As has been described according to Example 3 i a CS signal CSn supplied to the CS bus line in the nth row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal Gn in the nth row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises and ii a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 1 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises. Further iii a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 2 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 4 in the n 4 th row rises and iv a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 3 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 5 in the n 5 th row rises.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs double size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a positive polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. For example the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 2 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 6 of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every three horizontal scanning periods 3H . The source signal S has the same electric potential during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials gray scale of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively

Thus in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving the electric potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every three rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S therefore in the first frame the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Therefore inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative electric potential differences between the electric potential of the counter electrode and the shifted electric potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal having a negative polarity and the same electric potential is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal having a positive polarity and the same electric potential is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows next to the three rows in the same column of pixels the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the first three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the first three rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the next three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the next three rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This realizes 3 line inversion driving in CC driving.

Moreover the foregoing configuration allows the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes to be properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively even in a case of triple size display driving 3 line inversion driving . This allows pixel electrodes that are supplied with the same signal potential to be equal in electric potential to each other thus making it possible to eliminate the appearance of transverse stripes shown in .

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

According to the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit of Example 4 the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities at timings different from those in Example 3. The other configurations are the same as those shown in . Each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row and receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. That is as described earlier the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI. The polarity signals CMI and CMI are set so as to reverse their polarities at the timings shown in .

The following description discusses with reference to the liquid crystal display device which employs triple size display driving. In the following descriptions of connections in the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are omitted. shows waveforms of various signals inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 4. In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second third and fourth rows respectively.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the sixth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

By the operations as so far described i in the first to third rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to fall after the gate signals in these rows fall and ii in the fourth to six rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to rise after the gate signals in these rows fall see .

As has been described according to Example 4 3H inversion driving can be carried out by adjusting in the liquid crystal display device configured as shown in timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a negative polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. For example the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 2 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 6 of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As so far described in Examples 3 and 4 even according to the liquid crystal display device shown in 2H inversion driving and 3H inversion driving can be carried out by using two polarity signals CMI and CMI that reverse their polarities at the same time or at respective different timings. Similarly 4H . . . and nH inversion driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows carrying out double size display driving and triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

Examples 3 and 4 each discuss a configuration in which a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row. Note however that the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is not limited to this. For example as shown in the liquid crystal display device can be configured such that a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the n 3 th row. That is the CS circuit receives the shift register output SRO in a corresponding row and the shift register output SRO in the fourth row. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals in the liquid crystal display device which is configured like above and carries out a double size display. As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 2H periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively.

This realizes 2H inversion driving and eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus improves display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

As shown in the CS circuit receives shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and a reset signal RESET. The CS circuit receives shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. The CS circuit receives shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. The CS circuit receives shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Each CS circuit receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every three rows. That is as described above the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI. The polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities at the timings shown in .

In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second and third rows respectively. shows waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 5.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via the clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the sixth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

As has been described according to Example 5 i a CS signal CS supplied to the CS bus line in the nth row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal Gn in the nth row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and ii a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 1 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 4 in the n 4 th row rises. Further iii a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 2 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 5 in the n 5 th row rises and iv a CS signal supplied to the CS bus line in the n 3 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 6 in the n 6 th row rises.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs double size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a negative polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . The CMI and the CMI are set so as to reverse their polarities at the timings shown in . Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every three rows. For example the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CM.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the next n 2 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 2 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of F of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 7 of the CMI during the seventh horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls and the CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every three horizontal scanning period. The source signal S has the same electric potential gray scale during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential gray scale during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods KI . Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively.

Thus in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving the electric potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every three rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S therefore in the first frame the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Therefore inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative electric potential differences between the electric potential of the counter electrode and the shifted electric potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal having a negative polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal having a positive polarity and the same electric potential gray scale is written to pixels corresponding to three adjacent rows next to the three rows in the same column of pixels the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the first three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the first three rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the electric potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the next three rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the next three rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This realizes 3 line inversion driving in CC driving.

Moreover the foregoing configuration allows the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes to be properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively even in a case of triple size display driving 3 line inversion driving . This allows pixel electrodes that are supplied with the same signal potential to be equal in electric potential to each other thus making it possible to eliminate the appearance of transverse stripes shown in .

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

According to the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit of Example 6 the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities at timings different from those in Example 5. The other configurations are the same as those shown in . Each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the n 3 th row and receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every three rows. That is as described earlier the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI. The polarity signals CMI and CMI are set as shown in .

The following description discusses with reference to the liquid crystal display device which employs triple size display driving. In the following descriptions of connections in the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are omitted. shows waveforms of various signals inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 6. In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second third and fourth rows respectively.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the sixth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the seventh row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

By the operations as so far described i in the first to third rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to fall after the gate signals in these rows fall and ii in the fourth to six rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall i.e. at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to rise after the gate signals in these rows fall see .

As has been described according to Example 6 3H inversion driving can be carried out by adjusting in the liquid crystal display device configured as shown in timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a negative polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . Further each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every three rows. For example the CS circuits and each receive the CMI the CS circuits and each receive the CMI and the CS circuits and each receive the CMI.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the n 3 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 3 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of F of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 7 of the CMI during the seventh horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As has been described in Examples 5 and 6 even according to the liquid crystal display device shown in 2H inversion driving and 3H inversion driving can be carried out by using two polarity signals CMI and CMI that reverse their polarities at the same time or at respective different timings. Similarly 4H . . . and nH inversion driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities. This allows carrying out double size display driving and triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

Another embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . Note that for convenience members having functions identical to those of the respective members described in Embodiment 1 are given respective identical reference numerals and their descriptions are omitted here. Note also that terms defined in Embodiment 1 are used in the present Examples also according to those definitions unless otherwise noted.

A schematic arrangement of a liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment is identical to that of the liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 shown in . Accordingly a description of the schematic arrangement of the liquid crystal display device is omitted here. The following description specifically discusses a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit . In the present liquid crystal display device one signal line is provided for the CS bus line driving circuit to receive a polarity signal CMI from the control circuit see . This configuration achieves n line inversion nH driving for employing n fold size display driving by adjusting frequency of polarity reversal of the polarity signal CMI. In a case of a 2H inversion driving this configuration is achievable by having in the configuration shown in the polarity signal CMI be one of either of CMI or CMI and by setting the polarity reversal timing as every two lines. Moreover in a case of 3H inversion driving this configuration is achievable by having in the driving shown in the polarity signal CMI be one of either of the CMI or the CMI and by setting the polarity reversal timing as every three lines.

As such n line nH inversion driving with a single phase polarity signal CMI can be achieved by inputting a logical sum output from OR circuit of i a shift register output SROm from a current stage mth stage and ii a shift register output SROm n from the m n th stage to a latch circuit CSLm of the mth stage via its clock terminal CK and setting the polarity reversal timing of the polarity signal CMI to be inputted via the data terminal D as an n horizontal scanning period nH . The following describes as a typical example a configuration for achieving 4H inversion driving to employ quadruple size display driving.

Further shows the following signals in the order named a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source bus line driving circuit to a source bus line source bus line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS which is supplied from the bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and an electric potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and an electric potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. The same applies with the third to ninth rows.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the electric potentials Vpix through Vpix indicate the electric potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. As shown in during the initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signals CS to CS in respective first to fourth rows are at a high level at points in time where corresponding gate signals G which corresponds to the output SRO from the corresponding shift register circuit SR to G which corresponds to the output SRO from the corresponding shift register circuit SR respectively fall. The CS signals CS to CS in respective fifth to eighth rows are at a low level at points in time where corresponding gate signals G to G respectively fall. The CS signal CS in the ninth row is at a high level at a point in time where a corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every four horizontal scanning periods 4H . The source signal S has the same electric potential gray scale during two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H and has the same electric potential gray scale during next two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal polarities of a negative polarity AA during the first to fourth horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal polarities of a positive polarity KA during the fifth to eighth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first to fourth horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fifth to eighth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to ninth 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS to CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall the CS signals CS to CS rise after their corresponding signals G to G fall and the CS signal CS falls after its corresponding gate signal G falls. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS to CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall the CS signals CS to CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall and the CS signal CS rises after its corresponding gate signal G falls.

Thus in the liquid crystal display device that employs quadruple size display driving the electric potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every four rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S. Therefore in the first frame the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Accordingly inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative electric potential differences between the electric potential of the counter electrode and the shifted electric potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal having a negative polarity and the same electric potential is written to pixels corresponding to four adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal having a positive polarity and the same electric potential is written to pixels corresponding to four adjacent pixels next to the four rows in the same column of pixels the electric potentials of the CS signals CS to CS corresponding to the first four rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the first four rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the electric potentials of the CS signals CS to CS corresponding to the next four rows are not polarity reversed during the writing to the pixels corresponding to the next four rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This realizes quadruple size display driving in CC driving. Further the configuration allows the electric potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes to be property shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. This makes it possible to eliminate appearance of alternate dark and bright transverse stripes in a display picture.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and a reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. As described above each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROm in the corresponding mth row and a shift register output SROm 4 in the m 4 th row and receives the polarity signal CMI. The polarity signal CMI reverses its polarity every four horizontal scanning periods see . The polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET are supplied from the control circuit .

In the following for convenience of description mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the fourth and fifth rows respectively are taken as an example.

The D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives an output from the OR circuit via its clock terminal CK. In accordance with a change from a low level to a high level or from a high level to a low level in electric potential level of the signal that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit outputs as a CS signal CS indicative of the change in electric potential level an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it receives via its data terminal D.

Specifically when the electric potential level of the signal that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is at a high level the D latch circuit outputs an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D. When the electric potential level of the signal that the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK changes from a high level to a low level the D latch circuit latches an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the time of change and keeps the latched state until the next time when the electric potential level of the signal that the latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK is raised to a high level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the CS signal CS which indicates the change in electric potential level via its output terminal Q.

Similarly the D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL and receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D. Meanwhile the D latch circuit receives via its clock terminal CK an output from the OR circuit . This causes the D latch circuit to output a CS signal CS which indicates a change in electric potential level via its output terminal Q.

The OR circuit receives the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in its corresponding fourth row and the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in the eighth row and thereby outputs a signal M shown in . Further the OR circuit receives the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in its corresponding row and the output signal SRO from the shift register circuit SR in the ninth row and thereby outputs a signal M shown in .

A shift register output SRO supplied to each OR circuit is generated by a well known method in the gate line driving circuit see which includes D type flip flop circuits. The gate line driving circuit sequentially shifts a gate start pulse GSP which is supplied from the control circuit to a shift register circuit SR in the next stage at a timing of the gate clock GCK having a frequency of one horizontal scanning period.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the eighth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

It should be noted that the first to third rows have identical waveforms as that of the fourth row as shown in .

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fifth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the fifth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then the D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the ninth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

As shown in the sixth to eighth rows have identical waveforms as that of the fifth row. Moreover as shown in in the second frame the polarity of the polarity signal CMI is reversed so therefore the first to fourth rows have identical waveforms as those of the fifth to eighth rows in the first frame respectively and the fifth to eighth rows have identical waveforms as those of first to fourth rows in the first frame respectively. As to the third and subsequent frames operations are performed for each row so as to repeat the waveforms of the first frame and the second frame alternately.

As described above each of the CS circuits . . . and corresponding to the respective rows makes it possible in each frame in 4H inversion driving to switch the electric potential of a CS signal at a point in time where a gate signal in a corresponding row falls at a point in time where a TFT is switched from on to off between high and low levels after the gate signal in this row falls.

That is in Example 7 i a CS signal CS m supplied to the CS bus line in the mth row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal Gm in the mth row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G m 4 in the m 4 th row rises and ii a CS signal CSm 1 supplied to the CS bus line in the m 1 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G m 1 in the m 1 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G m 5 in the m 5 th row rises.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs quadruple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to prevent the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how a polarity signal CMI supplied to CS circuits is related to shift register outputs SRO. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI and the shift register outputs SRO which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signal CS outputted from the CS circuits.

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a negative polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . In this way the CMI reverses its polarity every four horizontal scanning periods.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROm in the mth row and a shift register output SROm 4 in the m 4 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the mth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the m 4 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit corresponding to the first row loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit corresponding to the second row loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of F of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit corresponding to the third row loads a positive polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of G of the CMI during the seventh horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit corresponding to the fourth row loads a positive polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of H of the CMI during the eighth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit corresponding to the fifth row loads a negative polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of I of the CMI during the ninth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CS as shown in are outputted.

Another embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . Note that for convenience members having functions identical to those of the respective members described in Embodiment 1 are given respective identical reference numerals and their descriptions are omitted here. Note also that terms defined in Embodiment 1 are used in the present Examples also according to those definitions unless otherwise noted.

A schematic arrangement of a liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment is identical to that of the liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 shown in . Accordingly a description of the schematic arrangement of the liquid crystal display device is omitted here. The following description specifically discusses a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit . Similarly with Embodiment 1 the present liquid crystal display device is provided with two signal lines for supplying polarity signals CMI from a control circuit see to the CS bus line driving circuit . The polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied via the respective signal lines have waveforms whose polarities are reverse to each other. In order to realize n line inversion nH driving for carrying out n fold size display driving in such an arrangement the polarity reversal timings of the polarity signals CMI and CMI are adjusted and the polarity signals CMI and CMI to be received by latch circuits CSL of respective rows are set. Specific examples are described below.

As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G which corresponds to the output SRO from the corresponding shift register circuit SR falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted here that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every two horizontal scanning periods 2H . The source signal S has the same electric potential gray scale during two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H and has the same electric potential gray scale during next two adjacent horizontal scanning periods 2H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity AA during the first and second horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the third and fourth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first and second horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the third and fourth horizontal scanning periods. Moreover since it is assumed in that a uniform picture is displayed the amplitude of the source signal S is constant. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to fifth 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively.

This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and makes it possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and a reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G a polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. Input signals to the CS circuit are shift register outputs SRO and SRO corresponding to respective gate signals G and G the polarity signal CMI and the reset signal RESET. As described above each CS circuit receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next row and receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. The polarity signals CMI and CMI and the reset signal RESET are supplied from the control circuit .

In the following for convenience of description mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second and third rows respectively are taken as an example. shows waveforms of various signals inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 8.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the third row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it receives a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Note that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the high level until the next time when the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

It should be noted that in the fourth row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

As described above each of the CS circuits . . . and corresponding to the respective rows makes it possible in each frame in 2H inversion driving to switch the electric potential of a CS signal at a point in time where a gate signal in a corresponding row falls at a point in time where a TFT is switched from on to off between high and low levels after the gate signal in this row falls.

That is in Example 8 i a CS signal CSn supplied to the CS bus line in the nth row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal Gn in the nth row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and ii a CS signal CSn 1 supplied to the CS bus line in the n 1 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 1 in the n 1 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises. Moreover i a CS signal CSn 2 supplied to the CS bus line of the n 2 th row is generated by latching an electric potential of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 2 in the n 2 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and ii a CS signal CSn 3 supplied to the CS bus line in the n 3 th row is generated by latching an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 3 in the n 3 th row rises and an electric potential level of the polarity signal CMI at a point in time where the gate signal G n 4 in the n 4 th row rises.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs double size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to prevent the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a positive polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . In this way the CMI and the CMI reverse their polarities every one horizontal scanning period and their polarities are reverse to each other. Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI which alternate every two rows. For example the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI see .

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI or CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI or CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 1 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of 4 of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted here that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 3H periods. The source signal S has the same electric potential gray scale during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential gray scale during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding signals G G and G fall. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall.

This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and makes it possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

In the following for convenience of description mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second third and fourth rows respectively are taken as an example. shows waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 9.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the third row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it receives a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

It should be noted that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state low level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it receives a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the low level until the next time when the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its data terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the high level until the next time when the signal M is raised to a high level.

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

It should be noted that in the fifth row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

As has been described according to Example 9 3H inversion driving can be carried out by adjusting in the liquid crystal display device configured as shown in relations between the polarity signals CMI and CMI and the CS circuits. This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a positive polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . In this way the CMI and the CMI reverse their polarities every one horizontal scanning period and their polarities are reverse to each other. Moreover each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI regularly the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI . The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 1 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As has been described in Examples 8 and 9 by using the two polarity signals CMI CMI having different phases from each other 2H inversion driving and 3H inversion driving can be carried out. Similarly 4H . . . nH n line inversion driving can be realized by adjusting relations between the polarity signals CMI and CMI and the CS circuits . This allows carrying out double size display driving and the triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

Another liquid crystal display device which carries out 3 line 3H inversion driving is described below. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals in the another liquid crystal display device . Note that in the polarity signals CMI and CMI are set so that the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities every two horizontal scanning periods 2H and the polarity signals CMI and CMI are reverse to each other in their polarity.

As shown in during the initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level when the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted here that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and reverses its polarity every 3H periods. The source signal S has the same electric potential during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential in next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials gray scale of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and fall respectively.

This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and makes it possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

The following description discusses 3H inversion driving with reference to . In the following descriptions of connections in the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are omitted. shows waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 10. In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example the CS circuits and corresponding to the second to fourth rows respectively.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Note that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the sixth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Note that in the fifth row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal CMI or CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D and has a positive polarity during the fifth horizontal scanning period E . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . Each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI and CMI in accordance with a given rule.

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 2 in the n 2 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 2 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of C of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of F of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

The liquid crystal display device that is described in Example 8 and employs double size display driving may be arranged as below. Namely the arrangement is such that a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn of the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the n 3 th row.

A fourth embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . Note that for convenience of description members having functions identical to those of the respective members described in Embodiment 1 are given respective identical reference numerals and their descriptions are omitted here. Note also that terms defined in Embodiment 1 are used in the present Examples also according to those definitions unless otherwise noted.

A schematic arrangement of a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the present embodiment is identical to that of the liquid crystal display device of the Embodiment 1 see . Accordingly a description of the schematic arrangement of the liquid crystal display device is omitted here. The following description specifically discusses a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit of the present embodiment. The liquid crystal display device is provided with a plurality of signal lines for supplying polarity signals CMI from a control circuit see to the CS bus line driving circuit . In order to realize n line reversal nH driving for carrying out n fold size display driving in such an arrangement i the number of polarity signals CMI and ii timings a frequency at which the polarity signals CMI reverse their polarities are adjusted. Specific examples are described below.

As shown in during the initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level when the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted here that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and reverses its polarity every 3H periods. The source signal S has the same electric potential during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials gray scale of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and fall respectively.

This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and makes it possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

In the following for convenience of description mainly the CS circuits and corresponding to the second and third rows respectively are taken as an example. shows waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit of the liquid crystal display device of Example 12.

Note that in the first row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the fourth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level .

After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level.

In the second frame the D latch circuit transfers an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D during a period of time in which the shift register output SRO in the signal M is at a high level latches an input state high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received at a point in time where it received a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO and then retains the high level until the next time when the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then upon receiving a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO.

The D latch circuit outputs the low level the next time there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the third frame.

Note that in the fifth row the polarity signal CMI is latched in accordance with the shift register outputs SRO and SRO thereby a CS signal CS shown in is outputted.

As has been described according to Example 12 3H inversion driving can be carried out by use of the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI which reverse their polarities every 3H and which are out of phase with each other. This allows the CS bus line driving circuit to operate properly even in the liquid crystal display device that employs triple size display driving. Accordingly it is possible to eliminate irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes. This makes it possible to eliminate the appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and thus possible to improve display quality.

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period A has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a negative polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . As to the CMI each of the signs a to l corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period a has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period b has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period c and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period d . In this way the CMI the CMI and the CMI reverse their polarities every three horizontal scanning periods and the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period whereas the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period. Further each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI regularly the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI .

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 1 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of B of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 3 of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of c of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of d of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of E of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As has been described in Example 12 by using a plurality of polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI which are different from each other in frequency 3H inversion driving can be carried out. Similarly 4H . . . nH n line inversion driving can be realized by changing a frequency and the number of polarity signals. For example 4H inversion driving may be realized by i using four polarity signals CMI to CMI ii setting a frequency of each of the polarity signals so that the polarity signals reverse their polarities every 4H and iii sequentially supplying the polarity signals to the CS circuits. This allows carrying out double size display driving and triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

Example 12 is arranged such that a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 1 in the next n 1 th row. However an arrangement of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. For example as shown in the liquid crystal display device may also be arranged such that a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the n 3 th row. That is the CS circuit receives the shift register output SRO in the corresponding first row and the shift register output SRO in the fourth row. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals of the liquid crystal display device that has such an arrangement and employs triple size display driving. In as in the case of Example 12 the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI reverse their polarities every three horizontal scanning periods 3H and the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period 1H whereas the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period 1H . Further the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI in Example 13 reverse their polarities at timings different from those in Example 12.

As shown in during the initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one electric potential in at a low level . During the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the third row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. In contrast the CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls the CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS in the sixth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls. The CS signal CS in the seventh row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted here that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and reverses its polarity every 3H periods. The source signal S has the same electric potential during three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H and has the same electric potential during next three adjacent horizontal scanning periods 3H . That is each of the reference signs AA to SA shown in corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a signal potential gray scale during that horizontal scanning period. For example the source signal S in the first frame exhibits identical signal potentials gray scale of a negative polarity AA during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity KA during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Further the source signal S in the second frame exhibits identical signal potentials of a positive polarity II during the first second and third horizontal scanning periods and exhibits identical signal potentials of a negative polarity KI during the fourth fifth and sixth horizontal scanning periods. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to seventh 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low electric potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G G and fall respectively.

This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture and makes it possible to improve display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here.

In the following for convenience of description operations in the first frame are explained by taking as an example the CS circuits and corresponding to the second to fourth rows respectively.

First the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the second row. During an initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the second row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its data terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO that has been shifted to the fifth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . The shift register output SRO is supplied also to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the third row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO corresponding to the gate signal G to be supplied to the gate line in the third row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. Then the D latch circuit outputs the high level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Then the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the sixth row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a high level to a low level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the low level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

Next the following describes changes in waveforms of various signals in the fourth row. During the initial state the D latch circuit of the CS circuit receives the polarity signal CMI via its terminal D and receives the reset signal RESET via its reset terminal CL. The reset signal RESET causes the electric potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit outputs via its output terminal Q to be retained at a low level.

After that the shift register output SRO in the fourth row is outputted from the shift register circuit SR and is inputted to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit . Then a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M is inputted to the clock terminal CK. Upon receiving the change in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M the D latch circuit transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the low level until the next time when there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Then upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit retains the low level until the signal M is raised to a high level.

Next the shift register output SRO which has been shifted to the seventh row in the gate line driving circuit is supplied to the other terminal of the OR circuit . Note that the shift register output SRO is also supplied to one terminal of the OR circuit of the CS circuit .

The D latch circuit receives a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK and transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. That is the electric potential of the CS signal CS is switched from a low level to a high level at a time when there is a change from low to high in electric potential of the shift register output SRO. The D latch circuit outputs the high level until there is a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M inputted to the clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the signal M is at a high level . Next upon receiving a change from high to low in electric potential of the shift register output SRO in the signal M via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit retains the high level until the signal M is raised to a high level in the second frame.

By the operation as so far described i in the first to third rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall at points in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to fall after the gate signals in these rows fall and ii in the fourth to sixth rows electric potentials of CS signals at points in time where gate signals in their corresponding rows fall at a point in time where TFTs are switched from on to off are caused to rise after the gate signal in these row fall see .

As has been described according to Example 13 even in the arrangement such that a CS circuit in the nth row receives a shift register output SROn in the corresponding nth row and a shift register output SROn in a row the n 3 th row in the above example later than the next row n 1 th row nH inversion driving 3H inversion driving in the above example can be carried out by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

The following description discusses how the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI supplied to the CS circuits are related to the shift register outputs SROn. shows relations between i the polarity signal any one of CMI CMI and CMI and the shift register outputs SROn which are inputted to the CS circuits and ii the CS signals CSn outputted from the CS circuits

As to the CMI shown in each of the signs A to L corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity positive polarity or negative polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a positive polarity during the first horizontal scanning period A has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period B has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period C and has a negative polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period D . As to the CMI each of the signs 1 to 12 corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period 1 has a positive polarity during the second horizontal scanning period 2 has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period 3 and has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period 4 . As to the CMI each of the signs a to l corresponds to a single horizontal scanning period and indicates a polarity during that horizontal scanning period. For example the CMI has a negative polarity during the first horizontal scanning period a has a negative polarity during the second horizontal scanning period b has a positive polarity during the third horizontal scanning period c and has a positive polarity during the fourth horizontal scanning period d . In this way the CMI the CMI and the CMI reverse their polarities every three horizontal scanning periods and the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period whereas the CMI and the CMI are out of phase with each other by one horizontal scanning period. Further each of the CS circuits receives one of the polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI regularly the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI the CS circuit receives the CMI and the CS circuit receives the CMI .

The CS circuit receives via its clock terminal CK a shift register output SROn in the nth row and a shift register output SROn 3 in the next n 3 th row. This causes the CS circuit to latch i a CMI that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the nth horizontal scanning period and ii a CMI signal that the CS circuit receives via its data terminal D during the n 3 th horizontal scanning period. For example the CS circuit loads a positive polarity of A of the CMI during the first horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of 2 of the CMI during the second horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of 5 of the CMI during the fifth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a positive polarity of c of the CMI during the third horizontal scanning period and loads a negative polarity of f of the CMI during the sixth horizontal scanning period. The CS circuit loads a negative polarity of D of the CMI during the fourth horizontal scanning period and loads a positive polarity of G of the CMI during the seventh horizontal scanning period. In this way the CS signals CSn as shown in are outputted.

As has been described in Example 13 by using a plurality of polarity signals CMI CMI and CMI which are different from each other in frequency 3H inversion driving can be carried out. Similarly 4H . . . nH n line inversion driving can be realized by changing a frequency and the number of polarity signals. For example 4H inversion driving may be realized by i using four polarity signals CMI to CMI ii setting a frequency of each of the polarity signals so that the polarity signals reverse their polarities every 4H and iii sequentially supplying the polarity signals to the CS circuits. This allows carrying out double size display driving and triple size display driving. Similarly quadruple size . . . n fold size display driving can be realized by adjusting timings at which the polarity signals CMI and CMI reverse their polarities.

The gate line driving circuit in the liquid crystal display device in accordance with the present invention can be configured as shown in . is a block diagram showing a configuration of a liquid crystal display device including this gate line driving circuit . is a block diagram showing a configuration of a shift register circuit constituting this gate line driving circuit . The shift register circuit in each stage includes a flip flop RS FF and switch circuits SW and SW. is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of the flip flop RS FF.

In the flip flop RS FF a gate of the p a gate of the n a drain of the p a drain of the n and the QB terminal are connected with one another a drain of the p a drain of the n a drain of the p a gate of the p a gate of the n and the Q terminal are connected with one another a source of the n is connected with a drain of the n the SB terminal is connected with a gate of the p and a gate of the n the RB terminal is connected with a source of the p a source of the p and a gate of the n a source of the n and a drain of the n are connected with each other the INIT terminal is connected with a source of the n a source of the p is connected with a VDD and a source of the n is connected with a VSS. Note here that the p n p and n constitute a latch circuit LC the p functions as a set transistor ST and the n and n each function as a latch release transistor LRT.

As shown in the QB terminal of the flip flop RS FF is connected with a gate of the switch circuit SW which gate is on the N channel side and with a gate of the switch circuit SW which gate is on the P channel side. A conductive electrode of the switch circuit SW is connected with the VDD. The other conductive electrode of the switch circuit SW is connected with an OUTB terminal serving as an output terminal in this stage and with a conductive electrode of the switch circuit SW. The other conductive electrode of the switch circuit SW is connected with a CKB terminal for receiving a clock signal.

According to the shift register circuit while the QB signal from the flip flop FF is Low the switch SW is OFF and the switch circuit SW is ON whereby the OUTB signal becomes High. While the QB signal is High the switch circuit SW is turned ON and the switch circuit SW is turned OFF whereby the CKB signal is loaded and outputted from the OUTB terminal.

According to the shift register circuit an OUTB terminal of a current stage is connected with an SB terminal of a next stage and an OUTB terminal of the next stage is connected with an RB terminal of the current stage. For example the OUTB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn in the nth stage is connected with the SB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th stage and the OUTB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th stage is connected with the RB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn in the nth stage. Note that the shift register circuit SR in the first stage i.e. the shift register circuit SR receives a GSPB signal via its SB terminal. Further in a gate driver GD CKB terminals in the odd numbered stages and CKB terminals in the even numbered stages are connected with different GCK lines lines that supplies GCK and INIT terminals in respective stages are connected with an identical INIT line line that supplies INIT signal . For example the CKB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn in the nth stage is connected with a GCK line the CKB terminal of the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th stage is connected with a GCK line and the INIT terminal of the shift register circuit SRn in the nth stage and the INIT terminal of the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th stage are connected with an identical INIT signal line.

A display driving circuit in accordance with the present invention is a display driving circuit for use in a display device i which carries out a display based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted to higher resolution and ii in which by supplying retention capacitor wire signals to retention capacitor wires forming capacitors with pixel electrodes included in pixels signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from data signal lines are changed in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials wherein assuming that a direction in which scanning signal lines extend is a row wise direction when the resolution of the video signal is converted by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in a column wise direction signal potentials having the same polarity and the same gray scale are supplied to pixel electrodes included in respective n pixels that correspond to n adjacent scanning signal lines and that are adjacent to each other in the column wise direction and a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from the data signal lines varies every n adjacent rows according to the polarities of the signal potentials.

According to the display driving circuit signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes are changed by the retention capacitor wire signals in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials. This realizes CC driving. Further according to the display driving circuit a display is carried out based on a video signal whose resolution has been converted by a factor of n n is an integer of two or greater at least in the column wise direction. This realizes high resolution conversion driving n fold display driving .

Further according to the configuration a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes from the data signal lines varies every n adjacent rows according to the polarities of the signal potentials. For example in a case of carrying out a display based on a video signal whose resolution as been converted by a factor of 2 double size display driving in both the column wise and row wise directions a direction of change in the signal potentials written to the pixel electrodes varies every two adjacent rows. This eliminates appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture see . Accordingly it is possible to eliminate appearance of alternate bright and dark transverse stripes in a display picture when a display device employing CC driving carries out high resolution conversion driving n fold display driving and thus possible to improve display quality of the display device.
