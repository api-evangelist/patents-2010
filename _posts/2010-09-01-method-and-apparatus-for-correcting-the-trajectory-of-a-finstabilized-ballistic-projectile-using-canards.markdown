The embodiments herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

The embodiments herein generally relate to launched projectiles and more particularly to correcting the flight path of a fin stabilized projectile.

Modern warfare is based on mission speed high per round lethality and low possibility of collateral damage. Achieving these objectives requires high precision. Unguided artillery shells follow a ballistic trajectory which is generally predictable but practically results in larger misses at longer ranges due to variations in atmospheric conditions including wind speed and direction temperature and precipitation and variations in the weapons system including manufacturing tolerances barrel condition propellant charge temperature and gun laying errors. As the ballistic range increases the potential impact of the projectile variation grows until the projectile delivered lethality is too low or the risk of collateral damage is too high to effectively execute the fire mission.

Precision in such weapons traditionally comes at a high cost. The missile community has developed and matured means to alter the trajectory of a missile in flight. These conventional methods generally involve relatively sophisticated mechanisms resulting in costly solutions. Mechanically these systems are not compatible with spin stabilized flight vehicles where spin rates are at least an order of magnitude higher and launch accelerations are several orders of magnitude higher. Cost breakdowns for current precision munitions indicate that the actuator system is a cost driver for the munition.

In such a system the projectile may include voice coil supports that support the voice coil in an axial direction. Furthermore the linkage assembly may comprise a voice coil shaft comprising a first end and a second end wherein the voice coil shaft is coupled to the voice coil to form a third pivot point and wherein the voice coil shaft is coupled to the voice coil at the first end and coupled to the linkage shaft at the second end using the pin and the slot. In addition the linkage assembly may comprise a flexing linkage member comprising a first end and a second end and wherein the flexing linkage member is coupled to the voice coil at the first end and coupled to the linkage shaft at the second end using the pin and the slot. Moreover the voice coil may comprise a rack and the linkage assembly comprises a pinion wherein the rack mates with the pinion and wherein the canard shaft rotates upon articulation of the voice coil.

In such a system the canard shaft may also comprise a cylindrical shaft coupled to the linkage shaft. Furthermore the canard assembly may comprise a plurality of elastically deformable bearing blocks coupled to the canard shaft and a plurality of support blocks proximate to the plurality of bearing blocks thereby creating a clearance gap between the plurality of bearing blocks and the plurality of support blocks.

It should be understood however that the following descriptions while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.

The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

Embodiments described herein provide a two dimensional 2 D correction system for accurately correcting both the range and deflection errors inherent in an unguided spin or fin stabilized projectile e.g. artillery shells missiles etc. . This is accomplished by intermittently controlling aerodynamic surfaces e.g. canards to develop aerodynamic lift and a rotational moment which nudges the projectile in two dimensions to achieve the desired trajectory. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

The movement of voice coil is along a linear path e.g. vertically in the view of . In the embodiment shown in linkage assembly converts the linear force F generated by a linear motion of voice coil into a torque force e.g. a rotation force T using pin and slot . Pin and slot combined with the linear movement of voice coil transmitted via voice coil shaft create a first pivot point . With the linear movement of voice coil first pivot point produces a lateral translation of linkage shaft which consequently creates a second pivot point with canard shaft . The lateral translation of linkage shaft when applied to second pivot point translates the linear movement of voice coil to rotational movement in canard shaft .

While the configuration of pin and slot shown in is one embodiment of an actuator mechanism embodiments herein are not limited to such an arrangement. For example other embodiments of such an actuator mechanism are discussed in further detail below. Moreover those of ordinary skill in the art may be able to identify additional embodiments to those described herein without undue experimentation.

While not shown in the embodiments of voice coil provides bi directional motion e.g. based on the polarity of an applied voltage not shown . Through the bi directional motion of voice coil canards rotate bi directionally e.g. back and forth . In addition voice coil can switch between a discrete number of positions e.g. on off and is controlled via a pulse mode not shown to provide a discrete number of positions for canards e.g. provide two position motion for canards . In an alternative embodiment voice coil can continuously control the angle of canard by providing position feedback and a suitable control circuit not shown .

The embodiment of canard assembly shown in also includes a clearance gap . Under a high g load e.g. during a gun launch canard assembly exerts a force on bearing blocks to thereby cause an elastic deformation of bearing blocks . This elastic deformation of bearing blocks eliminates clearance gap . When clearance gap is eliminated canard assembly is supported by support blocks . Thereafter when canard assembly is no longer experiencing high g loads e.g. after a projectile body not shown exits a muzzle not shown bearing blocks elastically return to their original configuration for lower actuating friction along canard shaft .

The embodiments described herein provide a linear voice coil e.g. voice coil driven canard actuation mechanism e.g. canard assembly for use for example on gun launched guided munitions. The linear motion of the voice coil e.g. voice coil is converted to canard rotation via a linkage e.g. linkage assembly . The canards e.g. canards are locked in place during launch e.g. bearing blocks and support blocks and until actuation is needed. The lightweight moving parts are fully supported during gun launch.

The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can by applying current knowledge readily modify and or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept and therefore such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
