The present invention relates to a novel filtration media and processes for removing toxic materials from streams of air at ambient conditions using the novel filtration media.

Carbon based filters are employed in individual and collective protection applications to provide safe breathing to personnel in a chemically contaminated environment. General purpose filters such as those employed by first responders and the military for example are designed to remove a wide range of toxic vapors. Examples of toxic vapors removed by general purpose filters include for example hydrogen cyanide cyanogen chloride phosgene sulfur dioxide hydrogen chloride and chlorine. The filter in its simplest form consists of a housing into which filtration media is located. The contaminated air stream is passed through the bed of filtration media. It is upon contacting the contaminated air stream with the filtration media that toxic vapors are removed by either physical adsorption or by chemical reaction.

Typically general purpose respirator filters employ activated carbon impregnated with basic metal salts which include for example copper chromium copper molybdenum U.S. Pat. No. 4 801 311 and copper zinc molybdenum U.S. Pat. No. 5 492 882 . Examples of basic metal salts include carbonates hydroxides and oxides. In several instances triethylenediamine is added to the formulation to promote the removal of cyanogen chloride U.S. Pat. No. 4 802 898 .

Carbon based filtration media rely on the metal impregnants to facilitate chemical reactions. This is because the contribution of the carbon substrate to the chemical reactions is small. For example mixtures of copper carbonate copper hydroxide may be impregnated into the pores of activated carbon to promote stoichiometric reactions involving the removal of acid gases such as for example hydrochloric acid HCl CuCO 2HCl CuCl HO CO Cu OH 2HCl CuCl 2HO

From the above reactions the basic copper salts react with hydrochloric acid to produce the corresponding copper II chloride while liberating HO and in the case of the carbonate carbon dioxide CO . Note that the above reactions are stoichiometric and not catalytic. That is to say one copper carbonate or copper hydroxide molecule will remove two molecules of hydrochloric acid. As a result of the stoichiometric nature of the reaction it is desired to maximize the number of reactive sites associated with the filtration media.

As is well known to one skilled in the art a well dispersed metal phase is desired in order to maximize the number of sites available to facilitate the reactions necessary for the removal of toxic vapors. Often times the loading of basic metal salts is limited to approximately 10 by weight metal to 15 by weight metal. Higher metal loadings can result in the formation of large metal particles leading to pore blockage and a decreased overall effectiveness of the filtration media.

Procedures for impregnating activated carbon with basic impregnants are well known to one skilled in the art. These procedures involve mixing carbonates hydroxides and or ammonium complexes of base metals such as for example copper copper carbonate hydroxide molybdenum ammonium molybdate zinc zinc carbonate hydroxide and vanadium ammonium vanadate in concentrated ammonium hydroxide solutions. Optionally ammonium carbonate is added. The solution is used to impregnate activated carbon granules to the desired metal loading. Materials prepared according to this procedure do not however disperse the metal phase throughout the pore structure. For example it has been reported that activated carbon impregnated with copper and zinc or copper zinc and molybdenum results in locating zinc primarily at the external surface of the granule versus a zinc phase well dispersed throughout the pore structure Rossin and Morrison 29 1991 887 Rossin and Morrison 31 1993 657 . The net effect is a reduced dispersion of zinc and a poor utilization of the zinc phase.

One mechanism for increasing the effectiveness of a filtration media to facilitate stoichiometric reactions is to employ a functionalized porous media. In this manner the support along with the impregnants will be capable of contributing to stoichiometric reactions leading to the removal of toxic vapors.

Substrates other than activated carbon are known to be useful in removing toxic chemicals. One example is zirconium hydroxide Peterson et al. 48 2009 1694 wherein zirconium hydroxide was found to remove sulfur dioxide from streams of air in an order of magnitude greater than the value achieved for activated carbon.

The removal of cyanide compounds such as for example hydrogen cyanide is of special interest to this invention. Base metal carbonates hydroxides and oxides of copper and zinc are known by one skilled in the art to be effective in the removal of hydrogen cyanide. For example hydrogen cyanide is removed upon contact with for example copper carbonate according to the following reactions CuCO 2HCN Cu CN HO CO 2Cu CN CuCN CN

According to the first reaction copper carbonate reacts with hydrogen cyanide to form copper II cyanide. Copper cyanide subsequently decomposes to yield copper I cyanide liberating cyanogen which is highly toxic and therefore an undesired by product. The addition of molybdenum to the formulation has been shown to minimize the formation of cyanogen however cyanogen formation is not eliminated all together. The role of molybdenum in minimizing cyanogen formation is not clear. One possible explanation is that molybdenum complexes with copper increasing the stability of the copper II cyanide complex.

Zinc is much more preferred in applications involving the removal of cyanide compounds such as for example hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is removed upon contact with zinc carbonate for example according to the following reaction ZnCO 2HCN Zn CN HO CO

There is no reduction of zinc II cyanide to zinc I cyanide as per reactions involving copper as described above. This is because zinc does not possess a stable 1 oxidation state and as a result the product zinc II cyanide is stable.

There are issues associated with the use of zinc only in carbon based filtration media. In order for an impregnant to be effective the impregnant must be well dispersed throughout the pore structure of the media. As stated above impregnation of carbon based media with zinc results in the zinc being confined to a region at or very near the external surface of the granule leading to a poor metal dispersion and consequently a poor utilization of zinc.

The removal of cyanogen chloride is also of special interest to the present invention. Triethylenediamine TEDA is known by one skilled in the art to be effective in the removal of cyanogen chloride. Although not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that TEDA catalyzes the hydrolysis of cyanogen chloride as described below 

Reaction product hydrochloric acid HCl is then removed via reaction with base metal carbonates hydroxides and or oxides or via reaction with TEDA. Reactions involving HCl and TEDA will poison TEDA. As known by one skilled in the art the addition of base metal oxides hydroxides and or oxides to TEDA impregnated activated carbon will increase the service time of the filter.

Thus an objective of the present invention is to provide an improved filtration media for removing hazardous materials from air streams. Another objective is to incorporate at least one reactive moiety within the filtration media to enhance the filtration performance. A further objective is to provide a method of using the improved filtration media to remove hazardous materials from air streams.

The present invention relates to a novel filtration media and process for removing toxic materials from streams of air at ambient conditions using the novel filtration media. The filtration media is comprised of porous zirconium hydroxide onto which at least one reactive moiety is impregnated. The reactive moiety is selected from materials which react with the toxic materials and or catalyze reaction of the toxic materials with other moieties.

The present invention relates to a novel filtration media and process for removing toxic materials from streams of air at ambient conditions. The novel filtration media is comprised of porous zirconium hydroxide Zr OH impregnated with at least one reactive and or catalytic moiety.

Zirconium hydroxide Zr OH is employed as a reactive substrate in the present invention. Although we refer to the substrate as zirconium hydroxide the product may be in the form of a polymorph of zirconium hydroxide zirconium oxyhydroxide and zirconium oxide. As sold on the commercial market zirconium hydroxide is an amorphous white powder that is insoluble in water. Zirconium hydroxide may be prepared by precipitating zirconium salts such as for example zirconium oxynitrate and zirconium oxychloride in aqueous solutions using alkaline solutions to bring about precipitation. Examples of alkaline solutions include ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Alternatively zirconium hydroxide may be purchased as a commercial product from vendors that include Magnesium Electron Flemington N.J. USA . The structure of zirconium hydroxide Zr OH may be represented as a two dimensional square lattice each connected by a double hydroxyl bridge yielding a stoichiometric Zr OH . Zr OH particles contain both terminal and bridging hydroxyl groups Southern et al. Chem. Mater. 14 2002 4313 .

Table 1 below compares the density and porosity of zirconium hydroxide granules to activated carbon granules representative of those employed by the prior art in the preparation of filtration media. The carbon granules were obtained from Calgon Carbon Corporation as product CWS carbon. The Zr OH was purchased from Magnesium Electron Inc. New Jersey USA . In Table 1 the surface area is expressed in units of mper cmof filter volume m cm and the pore volume is expressed in units of cmpore volume per cmfilter volume rather than the standard units of m g and cm g respectively. The former units are employed to account for the difference in the density of the two materials. Zr OH because of the higher molecular weight of zirconium relative to carbon has a much higher density. Filters are filled by volume not weight. Although not wishing to be bound by theory we believe the surface area and pore volume contained in the filter volume is far more important than the specific surface area expressed in units of m g and specific pore volume expressed in units of cm g .

Zr OH has sufficient capacity in its own right for the removal of many toxic vapors. However such basis media will not possess sufficient capacity for the removal of many toxic vapors such as for example hydrogen cyanide and will thus require the addition of base metals or mixtures thereof to facilitate said removal.

At least one reactive and or catalytic moiety functional group is are incorporated onto the substrate. Suitable reactive moieties are selected from base metals. The suitable base metals include vanadium chromium manganese iron cobalt nickel copper zinc silver molybdenum and mixtures thereof. Copper zinc and silver are preferred. Zinc is even more preferred since zinc will not form the hazardous product cyanogen upon exposure to hydrogen cyanide. The base metal may be in several forms such as for example free metal carbonates oxides and hydroxides. Carbonates and hydroxides are the preferred form. The base metal is present in the amount of about 5 to about 40 by weight of the filtration media. An amount of about 15 to about 25 is also useful.

Other reactive moieties can be incorporated into the zirconium hydroxide substrate. Of particular interest are amines which are useful in applications involving toxic chemicals that may be removed via hydrolysis reactions such as for example those reactions described for cyanogen chloride as described previously.

The suitable amines are triethylamine TEA quinuclidine QUIN triethylenediamine TEDA pyridine and pyridine carboxylic acids such as pyridine 4 carboxylic acid P4CA . Triethylenediamine is most preferred. The loading of TEDA can be as low as 0 if hydrolysis activity is not desired in the application or up to about 15 by weight of the filtration media should hydrolysis activity be desired. A preferred amount of TEDA used is from about 3 to about 6 by weight of the filtration media.

The present invention optionally includes at least one alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal to enhance filtration performance. Such metals are selected from lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium beryllium magnesium calcium and barium. The alkali or alkaline earth metal may be present as an oxide hydroxide or carbonate or mixture thereof. Up to 5 of alkali or alkaline earth metal can be used. An amount of about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of the filtration media is also useful.

Porous zirconium hydroxide impregnated with reactive moieties may be prepared using techniques well known to one skilled in the art. However it should be noted that the method of preparation can have a significant impact on the performance of the resulting material. One method of preparation is to form zirconium hydroxide powder into particles beads extrudates etc. of the desired mesh size. The powder in agglomerated or non agglomerated form is then impregnated using ammonium solutions containing the target concentration of base metal s and if desired alkali metals. Following impregnation the material is then dried at temperatures not to exceed about for example 200 C. and preferably not to exceed about for example 100 C. as this will bring about the dehydration of the zirconium hydroxide reducing its porosity and also its filtration effectiveness.

Following drying the impregnated material if desired can then be forwarded for amine such as for example TEDA impregnation. Using TEDA as an example amine impregnation may be performed using techniques known to one skilled in the art. Preferably TEDA is impregnated via a sublimation operation. For example a known mass of impregnated formed powder plus the desired amount of TEDA are loaded into a V blender or rotating drum for example for the purpose of contacting the formed powder with TEDA. During the operation TEDA will sublime into the pores of the formed powder over time. Heating the apparatus to temperatures on the order of about 50 C. to 100 C. for example will speed the sublimation operation.

A more preferred method of preparation involves impregnation of the porous Zr OH in the form of a powder. This is accomplished using impregnation techniques as described above. For example the Zr OH powder is preferably dried at for example 100 C. to remove pre adsorbed moisture. An impregnation solution is prepared by dissolving a base metal salt e.g. carbonate in a concentrated ammonium solution. The powder is then contacted with the solution until incipient wetness is achieved. At this point the powder is dried in an oven at for example 100 C. Once dry the powder can be impregnated with TEDA by placing the desired amount of powder and the desired amount of TEDA in a device designed to contact the two materials such as for example a V blender or rotating drum. The TEDA and impregnated powder are blended for a time sufficient to allow the TEDA to sublime into the pores. The TEDA containing impregnated powder is then formed into the desired geometric form e.g. particles beads extrudates etc. of the desired size using techniques known to those skilled in the art. One method is to form the powder into pills or tablets using a tableting machine. Alternatively the powder can be pressed into large tablets which are then crushed and sieved into particles of the desired mesh size.

An even more preferred method of preparation involves precipitation of the metals onto the porous Zr OH substrate. For example Zr OH powder is slurried in water. To the slurry is added a predetermined amount of alkali metal hydroxide such as for example sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide. A second solution is prepared containing a base metal salt dissolved in DI water for example zinc sulfate zinc nitrate zinc chloride zinc acetate copper sulfate copper nitrate copper chloride silver nitrate silver chloride silver acetate silver sulfate etc. Mixtures of salts may also be employed. The solution is then added to the slurry. The pH of the slurry is then adjusted to the target value of between about 5 and about 13 preferably between about 7 and about 11 more preferably between about 9 and about 10. The pH adjuster is an appropriate acid such as for example sulfuric acid nitric acid hydrochloric acid or formic acid. The reduction in pH will result in the base metal being precipitated onto the surface of the zirconium hydroxide substrate likely in the form of a metal hydroxide such as zinc hydroxide copper hydroxide etc. Upon completion of the precipitation the slurry is filtered then washed with DI water to remove any residual acid. The resulting solids are dried. The resulting dried powder may then be impregnated with TEDA as described previously. Upon completion of the TEDA impregnation operation the resulting powder may be formed into particles as described previously using techniques known to one skilled in the art.

An advantage of the above mentioned precipitation procedure is that the use of ammonia can be readily avoided. This is important as filtration media employed in general purpose respirators have issues related to ammonia off gassing as a result of impregnating the media using concentrated ammonia solutions.

The nature and loading of reactive moieties will depend upon the application. For applications that involve cyanide gases for example hydrogen cyanide zinc is the preferred reactive moieties since undesired by product cyanogen will not form.

The novel process disclosed herein involves contacting a bed of filtration media as described herein with an air stream containing toxic vapors or aerosol particles contained within the air stream. Non limiting examples of toxic vapors include acid gases blood agents or blistering agents selected from hydrogen cyanide cyanogen chloride phosgene hydrochloric acid fuming nitric acid nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide hydrogen fluoride hydrogen bromide carbonyl fluoride fluorine and sarin. Aerosol chemical warfare agents as well as industrial toxins can also be filtered from the air stream. Non limiting examples further include AChE inhibiting pesticides such as parathion paraoxon and malathion organophosphorus based OP compounds and nerve or vesicant agents selected from sarin GB bis 2 chloroethyl sulfide HD or mustard gas pinacolyl methylphosphonothiolate GD and 0 ethyl S 2 diisopropylamino ethyl methylphosphonothiolate VX as well as analogs and derivatives of these agents. Industrial toxins may include parathion. Aerosol chemicals will either evaporate into the vapor phase upstream of the filter bed or accumulate as droplets on the filter material only to be absorbed within the pores of the solid at a later time. Alternatively the aerosol chemicals may be entrapped on a particle filter located upstream of the filter media whereby the entrained chemical will evaporate over time and adsorb within the pores of the filtration media. The concentration of toxic materials in the contaminated air stream can be greater than 1 by volume. The filter may be any device that brings into contact the contaminated air stream with the filter material. Such as for example the filter can be a standard respirator filter worn on a face mask or one employed in collective protection applications such as involving vehicles and buildings. It is desired that the filter be of sufficient volume to provide a contact time between the air stream and the filter media of at least 0.05 seconds and preferably of at least 0.15 seconds.

The novel process disclosed herein is designed to operate under ambient conditions which can vary significantly based on the location and environmental conditions. Generally the novel process described herein is designed to operate as low as for example 20 C. and as high as for example 49 C. The humidity of the process stream may be as low as for example less than 5 relative humidity to as high as for example greater than 90 relative humidity.

Breakthrough testing was performed for the purpose of determining the ability of the novel filtration material described herein to remove toxic vapors from streams of air. Methods for performing breakthrough testing are well known to one skilled in the art. Briefly a known volume of filtration media is loaded into a tube and supported on an entrainment device such as a fine mesh screen. The filtration media is contacted with the contaminated air at the target humidity water content flow rate and temperature. The effluent stream is monitored continuously or at discrete intervals for the concentration of toxic chemical or hazardous by product. The breakthrough time is defined as the time in which the effluent concentration of toxic chemical exceeds a threshold value referred to as breakthrough concentration . Analytical devices used to determine the concentration of toxic chemical in the feed or effluent streams include but are not limited to infra red spectrometers gas chromatographs and UV visible detectors.

To a V blender was added dried Zr OH powder plus the desired amount of TEDA. The V blender was sealed then rotated in a temperature controlled enclosure at 60 C. for a minimum of two hours. The temperature is sufficient to sublime the TEDA with the vapor phase TEDA adsorbing in the pores of the Zr OH powder.

Samples prepared with between 0 and 10 TEDA were subjected to cyanogen chloride breakthrough testing using the procedure described previously. Results are summarized below 

Although breakthrough occurred near instantaneously for the sample impregnated with 1 TEDA the material displayed removal capacity. Results demonstrate that TEDA is required to facilitate the removal of cyanogen chloride. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that TEDA promotes the hydrolysis of cyanogen chloride to yield HCNO plus HCl.

A 14 CuO basis Zr OH sample was prepared via precipitation as follows. 200 grams dry basis zirconium hydroxide powder was slurried with 1 liter DI water in a 1 gallon pail using a high shear mixer.

The two solutions were combined and the resulting pH of the slurry was 10.1. The pH of the slurry was maintained at 10.0 by periodic adjustments using sulfuric acid. Following approximately 3.5 hours the mixing was terminated and the slurry was allowed to stand overnight. In the morning the slurry was re mixed then filtered. The product was washed three times with DI water at 60 C. The final product was dried at 80 C. overnight. 200 g of the resulting powder was added to a V blender along with 12.0 g of TEDA.

XPS analysis of the sample revealed a significant portion of the copper was in the 2 oxidation state. The presence of copper II coupled with the blue green color of the produce indicates that the majority of the copper associated with the sample was copper II hydroxide Cu OH .

A 20 ZnO Zr OH powder containing 6 TEDA was prepared via precipitation as follows. 200 g of dried zirconium hydroxide powder was slurried in 1.0 liters of DI water using a high shear mixer. To the slurry was added 120 g of potassium hydroxide KOH and 35 g of tetrapropylammonium bromide TPABr . A second solution was prepared by dissolving 141 g of zinc sulfate 28.3 ZnO in 500 ml of DI water. The resulting solution was added to the zirconium hydroxide slurry. Following addition the pH of the slurry was reduced to 10.0 using sulfuric acid. The slurry was mixed for approximately 6 hours then allowed to stand overnight. In the morning the slurry was re mixed filtered and washed three times with DI water at 60 C. The final product was dried at 60 C. over the weekend. 200 g of the resulting powder was added to a V blender along with 12.0 g of TEDA. The V blender and contents were sealed placed in an oven at 60 C. and rotated for two hours. The resulting powder was then formed into 12 30 mesh particles as described previously.
