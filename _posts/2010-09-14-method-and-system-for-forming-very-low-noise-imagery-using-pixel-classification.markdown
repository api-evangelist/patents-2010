This application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 331 888 filed on Dec. 10 2008 which is incorporated by reference herein now U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 829.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates broadly to signal processing and in particular to methods and systems for the enhancing and or processing images.

Appendix A contains a partial computer program listing adapted for a preferred embodiment of the present invention.

The present invention relates to the generation of images from projection measurements. Examples of images generated from projection measurements include two dimensional and three dimensional SAR synthetic aperture radar systems. SAR is a form of radar in which the large highly directional rotating antenna used by conventional radar is replaced with many low directivity small stationary antennas scattered over some area near or around the target area. The many echo waveforms received at the different antenna positions are post processed to resolve the target. SAR can be implemented by moving one or more antennas over relatively immobile targets by placing multiple stationary antennas over a relatively large area or combinations thereof. A further example of images generated from projection measurements are ISAR inverse SAR systems which image objects and many features on the ground from satellites aircraft vehicles or any other moving platform. SAR and ISAR systems are used in detecting locating and sometimes identifying ships ground vehicles mines buried pipes roadway faults tunnels leaking buried pipes etc. as well as discovering and measuring geological features forest features mining volumes etc. and general mapping. For example as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 805 098 to McCorkle hereby incorporated by reference an aircraft mounted detector array is utilized to take ground radar measurements. Other examples of systems using projection measurements are fault inspection systems using acoustic imaging submarine sonar for imaging underwater objects seismic imaging system for tunnel detection oil exploration geological surveys etc. and medical diagnostic tools such as sonograms echocardiograms x ray CAT computer aided tomography equipment and MRI magnetic resonance imaging equipment.

Systems which produce images from projection data generally use techniques in the time domain where a backprojection type algorithm is used or frequency domain where Fourier transforms are used. Since a Fast Fourier Transform FFT technique such as a technique known as the k implementation requires data to be equally spaced FFT based techniques produce sub optimal images when the data source is moving uncontrollably such as an aircraft buffeted by winds or vehicles in rough terrain. Non uniform spacing requires a Discrete Fourier Transform DFT which increases computation expense relative to a backprojector technique. Also two dimensional FFT s are not well suited to multiprocessor based supercomputers because they face a corner turn interprocessor communication bottleneck.

While there are many forms of Fourier based algorithms for SAR processing they fall into two broad classes known as strip map mode and spot light mode. The most robust technique is the k technique also known as seismic migration. The advantage of the k algorithm over the backprojection algorithm is speed. The k algorithm is an order Nlog N implementation much faster than Nfor large images and data sets.

Time domain backprojection based techniques have been used for numerous applications including x ray CAT scans MRI and sonograms. Historically medical people have preferred backprojection because its artifact levels were lower than those using fast Fourier transform FFT approaches. Efforts in the past to speed up the backprojection process have focused on fast index generation. The algorithm form used by the medical industry e.g. Star Computers for x ray CAT scans requires approximately 2Nadds to form an N by N image from N projections Nadds for indexing operations and Nadds for accumulating the projections into the image. Seismologists and people using SAR have also used backprojection.

Synthetic aperture radar systems have been used in applications such as area mapping surveillance and target detection. The radar is usually mounted on an aircraft or a vehicle configured with transmitting and receiving antennas to transmit and measure the reflected radar signals from areas of interest. Through signal processing the reflected radar signals along the flight path are combined to form the SAR imaging for side looking or forward looking surveillance.

SAR imaging is complex for a variety of reasons. First the data is not inputted at equally distant or known points. Instead data may be inputted in a non uniform manner from an aircraft that is buffeted by the wind or from a ground vehicle that traverses rough ground. Therefore motion compensation must be introduced in order to produce sharp images. Second the subject objects need not be point sources but may be dispersive where energy is stored and re radiated over time. Ground penetrating SAR adds the complication that the media propagation velocity varies which complicates seismic processing. For many SAR applications especially for high resolution ultra wide angle UWA ultra wide bandwidth UWB surveillance systems the task is particularly problematic because the data sets are large real time operation is essential and the aperture geometry is not controlled. For example small aircraft buffeted by the wind can affect SAR data due to significant off track motion and velocity changes. As a result the data is not sampled at equally spaced intervals.

Backprojection techniques provide many advantages including sharper images. Although prior art backprojector implementations may generate image artifacts they are constrained to be local to the object generating the artifacts and generally lie within the theoretical sidelobes. Side lobes are the lobes of the radiation pattern that are not the main beam or lobe. In an antenna radiation pattern or beam pattern the power density in the side lobes is generally much less than that in the main beam. It is generally desirable to minimize the sidelobe level SLL commonly measured in decibels relative to the peak of the main beam. The concepts of main and side lobes apply to but are not limited to for example radar and optics two specific applications of electromagnetics and sonar. The present invention is directed to techniques which minimize the effects of theoretical sidelobes in order to provide enhanced images.

Backprojector techniques also allow for non uniform spacing of the projection data. The non uniform spacing is directly accounted for in the index generation which is important when compensating for aircraft motion.

Conventional time domain image formation or backprojection from SAR data is accomplished by coherently summing the sampled radar returns for each pixel. In this context coherent summation can be thought of as time shifting the signal obtained at each aperture position to align them to a particular pixel and adding across all aperture positions to integrate the value at that pixel. This time align and sum sequence is repeated for every pixel in the image.

A method and system for forming images by backprojection is explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5 805 098 to McCorkle hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. Specifically FIG. 2 of the 1998 patent illustrates antennas at positions along axis in an array that observe pixels in the near field of the array. A relative position of each pixel q r with respect to each antenna position j defines a vector . For each pixel q r the disclosed process time shifts the signals obtained at each aperture position j to align or stack them at a particular pixel location to correct the signals for propagation time along each vector and then adds across all aperture positions to integrate to the value at the pixel. Thus signals propagating from that location are in phase and reinforced while signals propagating from other locations are not in phase and integrate toward zero. The image is generated by forming such a sum for each pixel as shown in equation 1A below.

In equation 1A below the pixels of the image area are indexed by q r and the aperture positions are indexed by j where j 0 . . . L 1 and L is the number of elements in the aperture. If s t represents the range compensated Rpropagation loss corrected where R is range voltage received at the japerture position as a function of time t zis an aperture weighting to shape the sidelobes for example with a Hamming window or to account for the aperture spacing and Tis the time shift necessary to align the signal received at sensor position j to the pixel at position q r a function of the round trip time from sensor phase center to pixel position then the value of the focused pixel at image position q r is given by 

Here t describes how the focused signal at location q r varies with time and is useful for studying late time target ringing. This description of backprojection considers the case where t is fixed for the entire image.

Accurately obtaining the time shifted values s t T requires a time domain interpolation of the sampled received signals. Prior art techniques included the following steps 

The following references give an overview of the state of the art and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties 

An example of a forward looking Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE radar that can be vehicle mounted has been designed and built by the Army Research Lab. A more complete description of the SIRE radar can be found in M. Ressler L. Nguyen F. Koenig D. Wong and G. Smith The Army Research Laboratory ARL Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE Forward Looking Radar Proceedings of SPIE Unmanned Systems Technology IX April 2007 hereby incorporated by reference. The SIRE radar has two transmitters and an array of receiving antennas. The two transmitters alternatively transmit wide bandwidth impulses to illuminate the area in front of the vehicle. An array of receiving antennas measures the returned radar signals. The wide bandwidth of transmitted impulses provides the down range resolution while the array of receiving antennas provides the cross range resolution. It has been shown that the configuration with two transmitters located at the end of the array is the optimum configuration to achieve cross range resolution while minimizing the number of required transmitters.

After data is acquired by the radar hardware it is transferred to a computer for signal processing and image formation. The signal processing stages include a self interference extraction b removing radar signature distortion due to moving platform and c sub band filtering. The self interference processing step to extract the interference components from the returned radar signals and the technique to remove the phase and shape distortion in radar signals due to the motion of the radar platform are described in the publication by Lam Nguyen entitled Signal Processing Technique to Remove Signature Distortion in ARL Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE Ultra Wideband UWB Radar Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL TR 4404 March 2008 hereby incorporated by reference.

After all the signal processing steps are applied to the returned radar signals the processed radar range profiles may be used for forming a SAR image. In a preferred embodiment the back projection algorithm is utilized for the image formation step. See John McCorkle and Lam Nguyen Focusing of Dispersive Targets Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Army Research Laboratory Report ARL TR 305 August 1994.

The index is computed using the round trip distance between the transmitting element the image pixel and the receiving element. The transmitting element is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . The distance between the transmitting element and the image pixel P i is 

The following is a description of the platform in as it passes four sequential positions located at x coordinates A B C D respectively. The formation of the first sub image begins when platform is at the coordinate A 20 meters from the block labeled 1sub image. As platform travels in the x direction as shown in signals emitted from platform illuminates an entire image area to the right of platform and the reflected signals are received by an array of 16 physical receiving antennas positioned on the front of the platform . Formation of the first sub image ends when platform reaches coordinate C at approximately 8 m from the block labeled 1sub image. Accordingly the radar signal data for the first full resolution sub image is received as radar platform travels a distance of 12 meters 20 m 8 m 12 m from coordinates A to C for formation of a two dimensional 2D aperture.

The distance traveled during the formation of the two dimensional 2 D aperture is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . When the platform reaches coordinate B a distance of 2 meters from coordinate A in the formation of the 2sub image begins and as the platform travels to coordinate D it uses the received data to form a second 2 D aperture. The distance traveled by platform is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . Note that the two apertures are overlapped by 10 m and the second aperture is advanced by 2 m with respect to the first aperture. Sub images and are formed from the 2 D apertures using the same length of travel 12 meters of the radar. This process is applied to ensure that image pixels have almost the same within a specified tolerance resolution across the entire large area. The sub images are formed from the radar range profiles using the back projection algorithm.

The term noise as used herein relates to image noise. There are many sources that cause noise in the resulting image. Noise can be divided into two categories additive noise and multiplicative noise. System noise thermal noise quantization noise self interference noise radio frequency interference RFI noise are some examples of the additive noise. Multiplicative noise is much more difficult to deal with since it is data dependent. Some sources that cause multiplicative noise include timing jitter in data sampling small aperture size compared to image area the under sampling of aperture samples the non uniform spacing between aperture samples errors in position measurement system etc. Multiplicative noise results in undesired sidelobes that create high noise floor in the image and thus limit the ability to detect targets with smaller amplitudes.

Radar and other imaging systems currently suffer various noise sources that prevent the generation of very high contrast images. As a result difficult targets with low amplitudes are often obscured or even embedded in the noise level of the image background. Moreover sidelobes from large targets are mistaken as targets of interest. Recently the ARL has designed and built a new ultra wideband imaging system for the detection of difficult targets. Currently there exists a need for an improved signal processing technique which reduces unwanted noise and enhances image reproduction.

A preferred embodiment comprises a SAR imaging technique using pixel classification to suppress both additive and multiplicative noise. The technique generates both types of resulting SAR imagery non linear amplitude only and linear amplitude and phase that are substantially noise free. A preferred embodiment involves the classification of each pixel in the image into either target class physical objects or non target class noise sidelobes based on its statistics from many realizable sparse aperture images. If an image pixel is classified to be associated with a physical object its value is computed from its statistics. Otherwise the pixel is assumed to come from a non physical object noise source and its value is simply zero.

Another preferred embodiment system for generating images from back projection data comprises using at least one processor to perform the following steps 

The resulting benefits include a extremely high contrast image with the almost noise free level b detection of targets with very small amplitudes especially located in the proximity of other large man made and natural objects and c the significant reduction in false alarm rate. These benefits will lead to the implementation of a practical system for detecting difficult targets which is the obstacle that most radar systems are facing today. Some examples includes 1 the SAR imaging of the ship or building interiors where the targets of interest have much smaller responses than the structure of the ships or buildings 2 The detection of buried mines along and on the sides of the road where the responses of the buried mines are significantly smaller than the man made bushes and trees along the road 3 the detection of difficult targets abnormal features tumors in medical imaging application.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements components regions layers and or sections these elements components regions layers and or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example when referring first and second photons in a photon pair these terms are only used to distinguish one element component region layer or section from another region layer or section.

Disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 826 826 patent is a non linear imaging algorithm that significantly improves the background noise level of the resulting image without negatively affecting the focus quality sharpness as well as the target amplitudes. In the 826 patent this technique has been denominated as Recursive Sidelobe Minimization RSM .

As depicted radar data is collected from a number of positions. For each position radar data and the positional data are recorded. A data point represents the received signal radar data from each position obtained during an instant or interval in time combined with positional information corresponding to the transmitting and or receiving position or location. The data points may be collected by either an array of elements or a single moving element which receives data at points in time or the combination of both e.g. a physical array of elements with the elements moving over increments of time. The data collection may be sporadic or at specific intervals of time. As exemplified in data points are obtained using an array of receiving elements which receive data incrementally. The data points are arranged to form an aperture. As used herein the term aperture means the information or data components used to form an image which may be for example an array of data points developed from a scanned area target or scene which can be used to form an image. In the apertures depicted in each column represents an interval during which the 1 k elements receive data each data point representing the image data from the signal received combined with the coordinates of the receiving element. After the data points are established in an aperture or array as diagrammatically shown in a substantial portion of data points are removed from the original aperture array of data points to form a subarray. Conversely the subarray may be formed by the selection of data points within the original aperture. Depending upon the quality of the result desired and the nature of the image being undertaken the substantial portion of the data points removed or selected may range from as little as one percent to ninety percent. However one percent removal will result in negligible difference and ninety percent removal will result in drastic reduction of image quality. In general it is preferred that the percentage of data points subject to removal be within a range of approximately twenty to fifty percent. Using the remaining data points in the aperture a first preliminary image is formed. During a second interval the process of removing a different set of twenty to fifty percent of the data points within the original aperture is repeated and a second aperture is formed. In a preferred embodiment the data points subject to removal are randomly chosen. However random selection is not necessary to practice the principles of the present invention and some other arbitrary or contrived selection process may be used.

A second preliminary image is formed from the second aperture following the removal of a different set of data points. The first and second preliminary images are then compared. Using the principles of the present invention the magnitude of the signal at each bit mapped location of the preliminary images is compared. Any pixel having a greater or equal value is discarded and only the lesser value is used for each bit mapped location in the merged image. For each subsequent iteration approximately twenty to fifty percent of the data points are removed to form an aperture and the preliminary image developed therefrom is compared with the previously merged image. The magnitude of the signal at each pixel or bit mapped location is compared and only the lesser value is retained for each bitmapped location in the combined image. This process is repeated iteratively over a series of iterations which may be for example ten to several hundred iterations. The result is the substantial elimination of noise from the resulting merged image.

Although the technique is implemented and demonstrated for the ultra wide band forward looking imaging radar e.g. ARL SIRE the technique is suitable for used for other image radar as well. The technique may also be applied for the BoomSAR radar which is a different radar with different configuration side looking . Moreover this imaging technique is not limited to the formation of radar images as it can be applied to other applications such as CAT scans magnetic resonance seismic sonar and acoustic imaging.

Use of the Recursive Sidelobe Minimization RSM technique results in an improvement of image contrast by reducing system noise by a significant level significantly improving system performance and can be adapted for use with existing radar systems. Results include the generation of high contrast images produced by significantly reducing the noise level in the system such that very difficult targets or objects with low amplitudes in the image can be detected which otherwise would be embedded in the system noise.

Generally speaking in any imaging system the sidelobes from large objects or noisy spots generated by the system may be mistaken as targets of interest. In accordance with the principles of the present invention the large sidelobes are substantially virtually eliminated thus reducing the false alarm objects that would be considered as targets of interest.

Possible uses other than radar imaging include magnetic resonance imaging CAT scan sonar imaging and acoustic imaging.

Step A The radar aperture is formed in preparation for image formation. The aperture consists of K elements. Each element in the radar aperture includes the radar receiving position information x k y k z k the radar transmitting information x k y k z k and the data record s t that the radar measures at this location. For side looking radar the aperture is usually a linear path with data measured along the path. For the forward looking radar mentioned above a 2D radar aperture is generated formed by the physical antenna array and the forward motion of the radar. Although the terminology 2D or two dimensional is used to reflect the aperture configuration the data within the 2D aperture may contain three dimensional information concerning the target area in that the signal data may include the distance at which the target is located relative to the receiving element. In general the radar aperture may take any of a variety of shapes and those shown are merely examples.

Step A The imaging grid is formed. In a preferred embodiment a rectangular imaging grid is generated although the imaging grid could be arbitrary defined. Each pixel P in the imaging grid is located at coordinate x i y i z i .

Step A A random compressive aperture is generated using the radar aperture with K elements from step A. The compressive aperture is formed by selecting only L elements from the original aperture for the imaging process. The value for L is . Where 0

The technique disclosed in the 829 patent may use a random number generator that produces random numbers with certain distribution. Those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that there are many types of distributions. The two distributions that are widely employed in practice are uniform in which all values from a finite set of possible values are equally probable and Gaussian in which all values from a finite set of possible values follow the Gaussian distribution that has the shape of a bell curve . Although any random number distribution could be used to realize 7 and 8 a uniform distribution random number generator may be employed in this preferred embodiment. There are many different implementations for generating a uniformly distributed random numbers for use in conjunction with the present invention including those random number generator routines that are usually defined and included in general purpose computer programming languages. For example in C programming language the two routines srand and rand are used to generate a random number. First the srand routine is called to initialize the random number generator. Next the rand routine is called to generate a random number between 0 and a predefined value RAND MAX. The following code fragment C language demonstrates how to generate 100 uniformly distributed numbers that have values from 0 to M 1000.

To generate the vector of random number Aas described in 7 and 8 one can use the random number generator as shown in the above code fragment example. Each time a random number is generated it is compared to the previous ones to ensure that all elements in Aare unique as specified in 8 . Otherwise another random number is generated to satisfy 8 .

It can be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the term random numbers as used herein includes numbers generated selectively or arbitrarily. As shown in the foregoing the selection process may be one of those commonly associated with computer programming but other number selection processes or arbitrary number selection processes may be utilized to achieve the same or similar results without departing from the principles of the present invention.

Generally speaking it is not intuitive as to why only a subset of the original radar aperture is used instead of the full aperture for forming image since gaps introduced in the subset of an aperture would seem to result in inferior performance. In prior art conventional techniques one generally prefers the full data set and avoids the gapped data set. However the benefit of this subset approach will be examined later in conjunction with step A below.

Step A The image is formed using the compressive aperture generated from step A. The compressive aperture derived from Awith L elements is then used to form the lrealization of the sub image using the backprojection method as described above.

This results in the lrealization of the sub image with I pixels in the down range direction and J pixels in the cross range direction where N I J 1 9 where P i is computed using equation 1 with modification reproduced below 

Step A The envelope of the image generated in step A is computed. The image generated in step A can also be written as 

As disclosed in the 829 patent in one preferred embodiment using the Hilbert transform filter the envelope of the jdown range profile from the lrealization of the image may be computed as square root over square root over . where the subscript is 12 The envelope of this image is simply

Step A An intermediate resulting image is computed. The minimum operator is applied to two images 1 the intermediate result from previous iteration l 1 and 2 the image formed from this iteration. For each image pixel the values of the two images are compared and the minimum value is selected

Another performance comparison is shown in wherein the cross range profile horizontal cut through each image two input images and one resulting image is displayed to compare the sidelobe level and the target response from each image. Again it can be appreciated that the target responses remain substantially the same while the sidelobe level of the resulting image is better lower than either input image. By repeating this process for many compressive apertures the sidelobe level in the resulting image continues to improve lower while the target responses remain substantially unchanged.

After step A the algorithm returns to step A to continue with the next iteration until the Miteration is finished. The intermediate resulting image is also sent to the display routine for visualizing the image. illustrates the compressive image and the intermediate resulting image generated in the first three iterations. shows the results at various iterations. In the resulting image at iteration the sidelobes are significantly suppressed while the responses of the two targets remained unchanged.

Although in the 829 patent the application of the RSM technique for a preferred embodiment configuration a UWB radar configured in forward looking imaging mode this RSM method could be applied to any coherent imaging system where measurements from an aperture of arbitrary geometry linear curve 2 D or 3 D are coherently integrated to form a 2D or 3D image. shows the before and after images when the RSM technique is applied to the SIRE radar data in forward looking configuration. illustrates a comparison of a baseline image left with an image right from a Recursive Sidelobe Minimization RSM preferred embodiment technique using data from another radar e.g. BoomSAR with a different geometry side looking SAR and a single transmit antenna and single receive antenna in a pseudo monostatic configuration.

With reference to in step the complete aperture Afor SAR image formation is formed. In this step the system collects the return radar data the coordinates of the receiver and the coordinates of the transmitter for each position k along the aperture of N positions.

The radar data at each position is s t 1 k N 1 The coordinates of the receiver at each position is x k y k z k 1 k N 2 The coordinates of the transmitter at each position is x k y k z k 1 k N 3 

For monostatic radar that uses the same transmitting and receiving antenna the coordinates of the receivers x k y k z k are identical to the coordinates of the transmitters x k y k z k . Since the monostatic radar case is a special case of the bistatic radar configuration the algorithm described here is applicable for both configurations.

The next step in is to form a baseline image using data from Aperture Agenerated from step using the standard backprojection algorithm 6 . In order to form an image from the area of interest we generate an imaging grid that consists of image pixels.

Each pixel from the imaging grid is located at coordinates x j y j z j 1 j M. 4 The imaging grid is usually defined as a 2 D or 3 D rectangular shape. In general however the image grid could be arbitrary.

The image Iis a bipolar contains both positive and negative values image that includes both amplitude and phase information. The corresponding envelope image Eis computed by computing the Hilbert envelope of I. The procedure to compute the envelope image is described in Nguyen Signal and Image Processing Algorithms for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Ultra wideband UWB Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE Radar ARL Technical Report ARL TR 4784 April 2009.

Referring again to the third step comprises generating a spare aperture from the complete aperture of N positions Agenerated from the second step. A 1 i L 13 where L is the number of iterations that the algorithm computes.

The sparse aperture Ais a subset of the complete aperture A. This sparse aperture only consists of K positions that are randomly selected from N positions in A where K p N and 0

One approach to implement this sparse aperture is to generate a random vector for this iiteration w 1 k N 13 where the value of wis either 0 or 1. There are K elements of whaving the value of 1 and N K elements of whaving the value of 0.

Referring again to the fourth step comprises forming the magnitude image Eusing data from the sparse aperture A from step and the backprojection algorithm described in step .

Note that equation 15 is the same as equation 5 except that the subscript o of Pand win 5 has been replace by i in 15 . From equation 15 although the summation is performed from 1 to N only data from K aperture positions are contributed to the final value of the image pixel since wgenerated from equation 13 only contains K non zero elements. Also note that the value of the denominator win equation 15 represents the number of non zero elements. This value is used as normalization factor for the final image pixel value.

Referring again to the fifth step of a preferred embodiment comprises the repeating of the third and fourth steps for L iterations 1

Referring again to the sixth step of a preferred embodiment comprises classifying each pixel in the SAR image based on the statistical distribution of its amplitude across L iterations. There are two possible classes 1 target class that includes the pixels that are originated from physical objects main lobes or 2 noise class that includes the pixels originated from some artifact sources noise sidelobes .

For each jpixel in the image grid the decision statistic is the standard deviation of the amplitudes of the pixel Pacross L iterations and this standard deviation normalized by the mean value of the amplitudes.

Referring again to the seventh step comprises computing the pixel characterization SAR image both magnitude and complex based on the decision statistics from step .

First a binary image is generated based on the decisions statistics computed from equation 13 . Each jpixel in the binary image has a value of 0 to represent non target pixel if its decision statistic dis greater than a threshold T and 1 to represent target pixel otherwise. Eb Pb 1 j M 16 where Pb 0 if d T Pb 1 if d T. The binary image contains NZ non zero elements Z zero elements. The total number of the pixels in the image is M NZ Z.

Since most of the pixels in the image are classified as non targets this would generate a very low noise floor in the resulting SAR image. The remaining pixels are classified as targets. Each of these pixels will have the maximum value across many iterations. Thus the technique virtually wipes out the noise floor that includes the sidelobes and maximizes the responses from the targets.

The resulting magnitude image of equation 16 is not a complex image. That means the phase information is not preserved in the image. The amplitude feature is probably the most important one in SAR imaging especially for the detection of difficult targets in the noisy environment. However in some cases it is desirable to exploit the phase information from the targets.

The pixel characterization technique of this preferred embodiment also generates a complex SAR image that includes both amplitude and phase information. From equation 11 the bipolar baseline SAR imagery Iis generated. This is a bipolar SAR image that includes both amplitude and phase information. However the baseline SAR image Iis contaminated with noise and sidelobes. In the binary image Eb from equation 15 the algorithm classifies each pixel in the image into either non target class or target class. Using this binary image we can remove the noise floor in the baseline SAR image I.

The resulting bipolar complex SAR image that includes both amplitude and phase information is computed as I P Pb 1 j M 18 where Pbis the binary pixel as defined in equation 15 .

The results of the simulation data of the basic concept of SAR imaging show the performance of pixel characterization technique of this preferred embodiment. A simulation data set was generated using the following scenario. The radar travels along a linear path transmits impulse signals to the side of the vehicle perpendicular to the path of the vehicle and captures the return data. Along the path the radar also records its coordinates at every transmit receive cycle. The coordinate measurement also introduces errors in the measurement data. There are four point targets in the scene. The data received by the radar is contaminated with additive white noise that is due to system external RFI sources.

There are four simulated point targets in the SAR image. The three high amplitude targets 1 2and 3 are obvious in the image. They are located at the pixel coordinates 60 200 100 250 and 140 300 respectively. There is a fourth point target that exists in the SAR image at the coordinate 125 275 . This coordinate is at the midpoint between 2and 3targets. This fourth target is not visible from the image since its RCS is so low that its response is embedded in the noise floor.

The decision statistic described in equation 13 to classify a pixel is the standard deviation of the pixel amplitudes across all iterations and normalized by its mean amplitude. Due to the scale property of the standard deviation equation 13 can also be expressed as the standard deviation of the pixel amplitudes that are normalized by its mean across all iterations. Thus it was desirable to examiner the statistical differences of the normalized pixel amplitudes across different iterations between pixels that belong to target class and noise class. compares the normalized pixel amplitudes of a pixel that belongs to second target from shown as a blue line in and a pixel that belongs to a sidelobe shown as a red line in . The distribution of the normalized amplitudes of the target pixel is much more stable than that of the sidelobe pixel. shows the same distributions for the second target s labeled as pixel as shown by a blue line and a noise pixel as shown by a red line. Again the distribution of the normalized amplitudes of the target pixel is much more stable than that of the noise pixel. shows a much more challenging case which compares the normalized pixel amplitudes of a pixel that belongs to target of a very weak target that is embedded in the noise sidelobe floor and a pixel that belongs to a sidelobe of . Although the normalized amplitudes of 4target are slightly fluctuated as shown by the blue line in they are much more stable than the normalized amplitudes of the sidelobe pixel as shown by the red line in . Similar result is shown in that compares the normalized amplitudes of 4target of versus a noise pixel of .

The envelope image of equation 16 is shown in . This image shows all four targets including the 4th target that represents one very challenging case for a SAR imaging system. The noise floor generated by the additive white noise and the sidelobes is completely wiped out from the resulting image.

The IF PC imaging technique has been shown to work so well on the simulation data. Usually the application of any technique on real data is much more challenging because of many unknown factors in real systems. In this section we present results using radar data from the Army Research Lab SAR radar as described in Lam Nguyen Signal and Image Processing Algorithms for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Ultra wideband UWB Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE Radar ARL Technical Report ARL TR 4784 April 2009.

Applying the pixel characterization imaging formation technique of this preferred embodiment to the same data generated the SAR image of . From the SAR image is virtually noise free. All the targets of interest are still preserved in the SAR image that is generated by this preferred embodiment pixel characterization technique. The preferred embodiment provides both amplitude and phase information. A key concept is the classification of each pixel in the image into either a target class physical objects or non target class noise sidelobes based on its statistics from many realizable sparse aperture images. If an image pixel is classified to be associated with a physical object its value is computed from its statistics. Otherwise the pixel is assumed to come from a non physical object noise source and its value is simply zero. In general in the case of noise fluctuations appear whereas a physical object exhibits more stability. The value is maximize for stable physical object pixels. The present invention enables the detection of very small objects that are embedded in the image noise floor especially if the targets are located in the proximity of larger objects. The invention may be utilized in conjunction with existing systems.

Examples of potential applications include implementation of practical systems for detecting targets in the most challenging scenarios. Some examples includes 1 the SAR imaging of the ship or building interiors where the targets of interest have much smaller responses than the structure of the ships or buildings 2 The detection of buried mines along and on the sides of the road where the responses of the buried mines are significantly smaller than the man made bushes and trees along the road 3 the detection of difficult targets abnormal features tumors in medical imaging application.

For example scanning an area includes scanning an object or objects person or persons place or scene. The terminology positional data includes but is not limited to spatial information relating to location.

As used herein and in the following claims the terminology data point data point represents the received signal radar data from each position obtained during an instant or interval in time combined with positional information. The positioning information may for example correspond to the transmitting and or receiving position or location. The data points may be collected by either an array of elements or a single moving element which receives data at points in time or the combination of both e.g. a physical array of elements with the elements moving over increments of time. The data collection may be sporadic or at specific intervals of time. As exemplified in data points are obtained using an array of receiving elements which receive data incrementally. The data points are arranged to form an aperture.

As used herein the term aperture means the information or data components used to form an image which may be for example an array of data points developed from a scanned area target or scene which can be used to form an image.

For bistatic radar the transmitting antenna is separate from the receiving antenna the transmitting element k from the aperture is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . For monostatic radar the transmitting antenna is the same as or co located with the receiving antenna the transmitting coordinates x k y k z k would be the same as the receiving coordinates x k y k z k . Since the monostatic radar case is a special case of the bistatic radar configuration the algorithm described here is applicable for both configurations. The returned radar signal at this receiving element k is s t . In order to form an image from the area of interest we form an imaging grid that consists of N image pixels. Each pixel Pfrom the imaging grid is located at coordinate x i y i z i . The imaging grid is usually defined as a 2 D rectangular shape. In general however the image grid could be arbitrary.

After the data points are established in an aperture or array as for example diagrammatically shown in a substantial portion of data points are removed from the original aperture array of data points to form a subarray. Conversely the subarray may be formed by the selection of data points within the original aperture.
