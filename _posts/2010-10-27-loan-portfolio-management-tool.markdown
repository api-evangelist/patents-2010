This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 256 733 entitled LOAN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TOOL filed Oct. 30 2009 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference.

This disclosure relates to a system and method to avoid loan defaults and foreclosures. In particular this disclosure relates to a system and method to forecast and prioritize loans that are at risk of default and or foreclosure develop and execute loss mitigation campaigns using distributed resources and provide recommendations to borrowers to transform at risk loans into performing loans.

Currently the mortgage industry faces unprecedented challenges in an effort to address a historically high number of loan defaults and foreclosures. Currently the mortgage industry reports that many borrowers are in foreclosure proceedings and the borrowers have had no contact with their servicer. A sampling of current mortgage industry loan portfolios suggests that few of the borrowers have workout plans in progress. Programs were designed to keep many troubled homeowners in their homes but typically few applications are received and the applications received failed to meet the programs guidelines and therefore were rejected. Millions of homeowners could end up defaulting on their mortgages in the near future. The pace of loan modifications is slow. Loan modifications may occur for a small percentage of seriously delinquent loans each month.

Mortgage default estimates are considerable in an economic climate of high and growing rates of default and foreclosure. Foreclosure cost estimates under such economic conditions are great. Many families typically lose their homes during such economic conditions. Recidivism rates for loan defaults and foreclosures rise. Regulatory mandates may be expected to force lenders and loan servicers to modify performing loans in order to assist borrowers under such economic conditions.

Bank and loan servicer financial impacts due to poorly serviced loans include 1 Rise in mortgage default rate with many of the defaulting loans going to foreclosure resulting in a unprecedented foreclosure rate across the industry 2 expected re default rate in such economic climate on modified mortgages using existing processes and tools has been more than a third of the defaults re defaulting and 3 the cost of a foreclosure to the bank loan servicer and investor yield foreclosure related costs across the industry. Borrower and other consumers impacts due to poorly serviced loans include 1 higher defaults on other accounts e.g. credit cards auto loans and 2 loss of home equity through foreclosures and short sales.

Therefore a need exists to address the problems noted above and other problems previously experienced.

In one aspect a Loan Portfolio Management system may 1 predict and prioritize loans at risk of default and foreclosure that are candidates for loan modification 2 recommend modification solutions for those at risk of default by applying configurable criteria and or through the use of data analytics 3 monitor and report on portfolio and borrower level health including success of applied loan modifications. In a second aspect the Loan Portfolio Management system may facilitate loan modification BPO Business Process Outsourcing through campaign management and buyer contact interaction capabilities.

The Loan Portfolio Management system may 1 receive current borrower and macro economic data against a loan servicer portfolio 2 identify and prioritize borrower candidates for loan modification to prevent loan default and or foreclosure 3 recommend a set of one to many modification solutions that minimize the modification cost to the servicer and maximize the probability of keeping the borrower out of foreclosure and 3 monitor manage and report on the portfolio risk profile through a series of executive dashboards on a daily basis.

The Loan Portfolio Management system may facilitate loan modification business process outsourcing BPO by providing skills and capacity to assist servicers in executing loan modifications. The servicer may include an optional borrower contact capability.

One misconception is that restructuring loans violates the contractual rights of investors. Streamlined restructuring is a strategy that may be pursued voluntarily by servicers in the interest of investors under existing PSA agreements Pooling and Servicing Agreements . PSA agreements describe how pooled commercial loans will be serviced and dictate how proceeds and losses will be distributed to bondholders investors . The significant deterioration seen in mortgage credit performance and the housing market indicates that the restructuring strategy may be a means to maximize the total net present value of securitized subprime mortgages. Given that maximizing the total net present value is the legal mandate of servicers servicers have begun to embrace the restructuring strategy more often as conditions have worsened. As long as restructuring is chosen voluntarily by servicers under the servicers existing PSAs and as long as the servicers can demonstrate that the servicers strategies are to maximize the proceeds of the pool restructuring the loans in the portfolio probably does not represent a violation of the investors contractual rights.

Accordingly the Loan Portfolio Management system may address 1 the lack of current borrower data 2 the lack of sophisticated data analytics 3 the lack of comprehensive and daily portfolio management capability 4 the limited borrow contact capability and 5 limited skills and resource capacity. For example the systems may retrieve current data apply sophisticated analytics organize and report on data provide what if analysis learn over time to enhance default predictability and apply capacity industrialization process maturity. Thus the systems may significantly reduce default and foreclosure rates and costs benefiting servicers borrowers and the country.

The systems may benefit the servicer investor by reducing servicer default rates and costs through intelligent modifications i.e. reduced foreclosure costs and reduced modification costs . The systems may facilitate more focused loss mitigation campaigns prior to making borrower contact. The systems may further provide a relief valve for resources to address the mounting loan modification backlog.

Millions of families may remain in their homes and have affordable mortgages. Homeowners may maintain current credit scores as loan modifications do not result in an adverse credit profile notification. In one example the system may provide workout options for all of a borrower s debt obligations and not just the borrower s mortgage. Faster resolution of default situation may result in a higher probability of a one time fix .

A tool may collect data into a lending data warehouse. The data may include 1 fresh borrower data such as income 2 loan system data and investor terms 3 macroeconomic data and 4 property valuation data. An analytics engine may analyze the data in the lending data warehouse to prepare a prioritized list of loans based on default probability. The analytics engine may further recommended remediation strategy based on determined goals such as default probability avoidance servicer costs investor impacts and net present value NPV analysis.

The Loan Portfolio Management LPM system may adjust the effect of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes. When regulatory changes occur the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio may change. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.

Benefits to banks and servicers may include for example 1 3 4 reduction in an overall expected default rate across the industry through better insights and optimal modification offers causing a resultant 1 2 reduction in the 5 foreclosure rate and 2 industry wide this represents a potential foreclosure cost savings of 30 50 B 13 22 B when looking at strictly operational costs .

Reducing foreclosures will help stabilize falling home prices because same street foreclosures immediately drive property values down by about 1 5 . Stabilizing falling home prices may benefit the national economy.

Other systems methods features and advantages will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the figures and detailed description. All such additional systems methods features and advantages are included within this description are within the scope of the claimed subject matter and are protected by the following claims.

Many loan servicers and mortgage backed securities investors lack the data analytics portfolio management and reporting capabilities necessary to adequately forecast loan defaults and foreclosures. Loan servicers and investors also lack the tools and expertise necessary to design and or identify loan remediation recommendations intended to avoid defaults and foreclosures. Additionally many loan servicers and investors also lack the tools and expertise necessary to minimize costs to the loan servicers in servicing loans.

Current systems fail to analyze macro economic conditions and data such as upward pricing of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages rising rate of unemployment and underemployment ongoing decreases in property values in order to properly analyze normalized borrowers and loan portfolios. Current systems also fail to analyze borrowers and loan portfolios by adjusting for the spread between agency bonds and treasury bonds which may indicate that fewer refinancing options are available and prioritize remediation recommendations accordingly.

In particular current industry systems limitations include the following 1 LTV loan to value is being misrepresented in portfolio analytics as changes in collateral data are not readily available 2 changes in borrower s income and employment status are unknown or not reported in timely manner to loan servicers which is preventing many at risk loans from being flagged for scrutiny 3 no automated and cohesive way exists to promptly report analysis and receive updates of various data regarding the borrowers profiles and loan data for each loan of a group of loan portfolios 4 limited forward thinking analytics and 5 limited ability to analyze loans and provide modification offers on an industrialized scale.

Current industry systems rely on stale borrower data. Loan servicers rely on stale income employment and asset information which is rarely or never refreshed after being collected. Credit bureau data for example is often only refreshed quarterly. Current industry systems lack current real time property data. Loan servicers often use stale and or inaccurate property valuations particularly given the rapid change in values and differences by geography.

Current industry systems lack necessary analytics. Current systems have limited risk models. Current predictive models are focused on assessing risk based on past performance and are not being used to analyze high risk performing loans. Current systems have limited NPV modeling and many lack the capability to calculate with accuracy the minimum amount of modification and cost required to keep the borrower out of default and or foreclosure.

Current systems lack necessary reporting and monitoring for borrower profile updates and loan portfolio updates. Current systems have limited portfolio management and reporting capabilities and many lack a centralized data warehouse and dashboard management tool to sufficiently house analyze report and track portfolio credit conditions. Current systems provide little automation in dashboard creation and existing dashboards are created using significant man power and thereby dashboard updates are available only on a less than real time basis.

Current systems lack the capability to interact with people and implement processes to address limited borrower contact. Many loan servicers are unsuccessful in reaching borrowers to validate borrower data and process loan modifications. Loan servicers often have limited skills and staff to handle loan modification volume beyond a particular threshold number of loans. Loan servicers threshold values may not accommodate a constant large volume of loan modifications defaults and foreclosures. Loan servicers are often understaffed and under skilled to handle an accelerating volume of defaults modifications and foreclosures. Current systems provide no tools to focus on performing loans. Because of a lack of tools to perform the proper analysis loan servicers have become conditioned to accept a general reluctance to review and take action on the performing component of the loan servicers portfolios in order to monitor performing loans so that recommended proactive remediation measures may be taken as a result of analyzing borrower profile and loan portfolio updates.

The loan portfolio management LPM system includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory includes instructions that when executed by the processor may cause the processor to retrieve into the memory borrower data macro economic data and loan servicer portfolio data for a loan servicer wherein the loan servicer portfolio comprises data for loans to borrowers that the loan servicer services. The instructions may further cause the processor to analyze using the loan servicer portfolio data and the macro economic data the loans and the borrower data to prioritize the borrowers and the loans according to configurable risk threshold values and identify at risk loans. In one implementation when one of the loans is determined to be an at risk loan the instructions identify a contact management campaign for the borrower recommend a remediation solution for the at risk loan according to the contact management campaign monitor updates to the borrower data to determine whether the updated borrower data exceeds the configurable risk threshold values and execute the remediation solution. The loan portfolio management system may further include a graphical user interface configured to display a loan servicer portfolio management interface. The loan servicer portfolio management interface may be configured to display the loan servicer portfolio receive user input and display the remediation solution.

The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to store the borrower data macro economic data and loan servicer portfolio data in a data repository. The macro economic data may include pricing of mortgages rate of unemployment rate of underemployment property values and spreads between agency bonds and U.S. treasury bonds. Agency bonds may include bonds issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies.

The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to adjust the effects of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes by scaling borrowers using a borrower loan portfolio management index in order to filter the effects that cause statistical changes to the borrowers profiles over time. Changes that occur over time may include for example regulatory changes individual borrower profiles borrower regulatory profiles economic impact to the loan servicers and investors. When changes occur over time the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio change. The more variability in the profiles of borrowers the more difficult the task of comparing borrowers in order to calculate better forecasts. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.

Alternatively or in addition a loan remediation entity may use the LPM system to carry out at least in part the contact management campaign. The contact management campaign may be configured to maximize the ability of the loan remediation entity to contact the borrower and to encourage the borrower to agree to the remediation solution.

The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to automatically route the borrower to the loan remediation entity external to the loan servicer when one of the loans is determined to be an at risk loan.

The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to calculate a borrower loan portfolio management LPM index regulatory component a LPM index market component a LPM index loan servicer and investor component and a borrower personal data component. The LPM system instructions may cause the processor to adjust the effects of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes by scaling borrowers using a borrower loan portfolio management index in order to filter the effects that cause statistical changes to the borrowers profiles over time. Changes that occur over time may include for example regulatory changes individual borrower profiles borrower regulatory profiles economic impact to the loan servicers and investors. When changes occur over time the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio change. The more variability in the profiles of borrowers the more difficult the task of comparing borrowers in order to calculate better forecasts. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.

The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to analyze results of the executed remediation solution to identify whether the remediation solution was successful identify a remediation resolution trend by comparing results of a previously executed remediation solution to the results of the executed remediation solution and refine the executed remediation solution into a new remediation solution to recommend to borrowers in the future.

The LPM system may generate recommended remediation solutions and alternative remediation solutions that conform to the contact management campaign. The recommended and the alternative remediation solutions each may comprise a success probability that identifies a probability of transforming the at risk loan into a performing loan. The LPM system instructions may use the success probabilities of the recommended and the alternative remediation solutions to display the recommended and the alternative remediation in a ranked order.

The LPM system communicates with the various entities and data sources through a communications interface coupled to a processor and memory . The memory comprises data received from the various entities and data sources. For example the data in the memory may include borrowers profiles property data financial institutions data loan portfolio performance data contract data and macro economics data that the LPM system stores in the LPM data warehouse . The memory may further include loan servicer portfolio data that comprises loan data e.g. and for each loan of the loan servicers portfolios .

Portfolio analyzer logic in the memory may be configured to analyze the loan servicer portfolio data in view of various data e.g. and to assign an at risk loan identifier to a loan identified to be at risk of default and or foreclosure. The portfolio analyzer logic may use configurable risk threshold values to determine whether a loan in a servicer s portfolio is at risk.

The LPM system may include a graphical user interface to receive data such as data updates and user selections from users. A user interface GUI is a type of user interface which enables people to interact with electronic devices such as computers hand held devices MP3 Players Portable Media Players Gaming devices household appliances and office equipment. A GUI may offer graphical icons and visual indicators as opposed to text based interfaces typed command labels or text navigation to fully represent the information and actions available to a user. The actions may be performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. More generally a user interface may include software hardware or a combination thereof through which people users interact with a machine device computer program or any combination thereof.

Alternatively or in addition the LPM system may receive data such as data updates and user selections from other systems such as a borrower system a user system and at least one loan servicer system including for example loan servicer loan servicer and loan servicer . Each one of the borrower system the user system and loan servicer system may include respective GUIs.

Alternatively or in addition the borrower system may communicate borrowers profile updates to the LPM system . The borrower system may receive the recommended remediation solutions and the alternative remediation solutions from the LPM system when borrower health analyzer logic stored in the memory identifies a customer contact campaign match for the borrower from several customer contact campaigns . The LPM system performs portfolio monitoring of the various entities and data sources to refine the composition of tasks and execution of the recommended remediation solutions and alternative remediation solutions . The LPM system may analyze the campaign results and remediation results to refine the composition of tasks and execution of the recommended remediation solutions and alternative remediation solutions . The LPM system may determine success probabilities and loss estimates for each loan and in the loan servicers portfolios and success probabilities and loss estimates forecasted to result when using each of the recommended remediation solutions and the alternative remediation solutions .

The LPM system may present various LPM results and or direct other systems to present the various LPM results such as performance data campaign results remediation results and converted loans and analysis in the form of portfolio reports and dashboards . The various LPM results may be presented in the user interface a borrower health analyzer interface a portfolio analyzer interface discussed below and or any other graphical user interface.

The remediation results may also include a borrower loan portfolio management LPM index . The LPM system may determine the borrower LPM index in order to scale the loans and borrower profiles for each borrower. The borrower LPM index may include a regulatory component a market component a loan servicer and investor component and a borrower personal data component. The LPM system may based on the borrower LPM index more accurately compare borrowers and loans by adjusting for differences that result over time from changes in regulatory and markets changes to contract terms between loan servicers and investors and changes to a borrowers personal data.

The portfolio trending statistics and analysis information may include any data related to the loan portfolio as a whole. For example the portfolio trending statistics and analysis information may include NPV gain or loss for the current week NPV gain or loss for the previous 6 months and a projected three month NPV gain or loss. Additionally or alternatively the portfolio trending statistics and analysis information may include a percentage of the loans for which corrective action has been taken during the last two months. Additionally or alternatively the portfolio trending statistics and analysis information may include a total of the number of modified loans which do not re default and a summary of foreclosure costs avoided due to loan modifications.

The portfolio trending statistics and analysis information may reflect information related to segmented campaigns. The LPM system may facilitate design and monitoring of the segmented campaigns to maximize contact with the borrower and to encourage default resolution actions by the borrower. The campaigns may be created to target various segments of borrowers. For example the contact campaign segments may correspond to borrower demographics such as borrowers having performing loans that are no more than 29 days late default loans that are between 30 and 89 days late and foreclosure loans that are at least 90 days late. In one example the contact campaign segments may be identified by the customer via for example a self directed portal. In a second example the contact campaign segments may be identified by loan servicers. Customers may be contacted according to the campaign guidelines.

The loan modification statistics and analysis may include information about loan modifications for each respective one of the contact campaign segments. For example the loan modification statistics and analysis may include summary information about loan modifications such as the number of loans modified in the loan portfolio during a period of time the total cost of the loan modifications cost savings from avoided defaults and a percentage of loans having terms rates and or principals modified.

The performing loans status and statistics may include information about the loans in each one of the contact campaign segments. For example the performing loans status and statistics may include the number of loans in the respective one of the contact campaign segments the NPV of those loans the percentage of that those loans are of the total of number of loans in the portfolio.

The probability of segment information may include for example an indication of whether the probability of defaulting on the loans in the respective one of the contact campaign segments is likely to increase stay the same or decrease. The geographic trending statistics and analysis may include an indication of whether the geographic regions associated with the loans in the respective one of the contact campaign segments is likely to expand stay the same or shrink. The loan to value of loan portfolio may include an indication of whether the loan to value of the loans in the respective one of the contact campaign segments is likely to improve stay the same or deteriorate. The payment ratios for loans in the loan portfolios may include indication of whether the payment ratios for the loans in the respective one of the contact campaign segments is likely to improve stay the same or deteriorate.

The products may include a workstation product a business process outsourcing product and an analytics suite. Financial institutions may include banks GSEs which are government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae pure play servicers such as companies dedicated to one line of business. The data may include borrowers income property data from which the loans are secured borrower credit data data indicative of performance of the loans contract information associated with the loans verification of income of the borrowers assets of the borrowers hardship letters from borrowers economic data demographic data or any other data used for predictive modeling. The LPM system may include a self directed portal to collect updated borrower information directly from borrowers.

Updated income indicator may be used to calculate new payment to income ratio. New property valuation used to calculate new loan to value ratio.

The workstation product may include the dashboard the portfolio analyzer borrower health analyzer. The business process outsourcing product may include loan modification short sale and watch list capabilities.

The analytics suite may based on configurable business rules identify and prioritize loan modification candidates and provide workout solutions to support customizing both 1 Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plans such as occupancy payment to income ratio loan limit etc. and 2 client specific customizations such as predictive models NPV calculations workout programs etc. The analytics suite may identify and rate potentially troubled assets. The analytics suite may provide an early warning system based on the likelihood the loans in the loan portfolios may become a troubled asset FICO scores mortgage FICO scores roll rate scores and regional risk indicators. The analytics suite may determine a loss estimate if a loan were to default. The analytics suite may recommend correction action by identifying optimal loan modification terms for borrower and lender. The recommended correction action may be based on an estimated benefit of modifying loan terms proposed loan terms and credit capacity index updates for the borrowers and borrower LPM index updates .

Deliverables of the LPM system may include portfolio reporting to present results of the analytical calculations that may be used to drive corrective action at the regional and or individual loan level monitoring of loan portfolios and converted loans that were modified based on the analytical recommendations. The portfolio reporting may include watchlists loans ranked by future risk probability recommend actions by NPV customer outreach call lists loan performance what if reporting that based on external changes regional reporting dynamic loan management that provides a playground in which to carry out sample scenarios and results of campaigns actually executed. The LPM system facilitates aggregating segmenting and categorizing the loan portfolio data so that a user may slice and dice the information to obtain a corresponding report.

LPM workstation interface may interact with the portfolio analyzer by providing the capability to zoom from the overall portfolio and watchlist down to more detailed views use illustrative graphs and charts to display portfolio level information loans presented in priority order according to roll rate score and corrective action recommendation. The interaction with the portfolio analyzer may display predictive models segments in order to provide insight into borrowers behaviors and tendencies. LPM workstation interface may include the capability to provide deep insight into specific campaign and may dynamically display expected vs. actual results. LPM workstation interface may include the capability to dynamically generate control room reports based on user selected criteria.

LPM workstation interface may include interaction with the borrower health analyzer. The interaction with the borrower health analyzer provides recommended workout scenario based on borrower attributes provides key risk indicators for an individual borrower ties back metrics to recommendations for loan modifications short sale and foreclosure prioritizes recommendations with rationale as well as the ability to override the decision and prioritizes recommendations according to NPV. The interaction with the borrower health analyzer may be based on borrower data co borrower data loan data borrower health loan documentation the LPM system recommendation short sale and override entries. For example the display of the LPM system recommendation may include prioritized recommendations ordered by any combination of the predicted success rate NPV and rationale. For example Short sale PA recommendations including sale price investor loss. PA recommendations rationale borrower DTI in current loan is XX borrower anticipate job loss next 3 months PA confirm job outlook weak in borrower region borrower not able to successfully complete loan modification and case Schiller data indicates property value stabilization over next XXX months investor approval date and borrower willing to sell confirmation and description of conditions for sale. Display of the borrower health may provide recommended workout scenarios and key risk indicator at the borrower level and facilitate the execution of all loan management scenarios including short sells.

The LPM workstation interface may include reporting capabilities. For example client data may be compared to national trends to illustrate a loan s relative health to peers forecasts may be based on national trends and current client data performance. In a second example the LPM workstation interface may include management and operational reporting capabilities based on campaigns and user generated reports. In a third example forecast analysis may provide the capability to gain insight into a portfolio based on what if forecasted analysis of macro economic trends and current client data performance.

The credit capacity index CCI is an assessment of consumer credit risk associated with future incremental debt. CCI is for uses with a risk score to rank order the likelihood that consumers can have the credit capacity to take on incremental future revolving debt within a given risk level. Higher scores equate to lower future risk of default. Used for credit decisions across the consumer credit lifecycle such as targeting underwriting customer management. The benefit of including the CCI in the analysis is to provide a forward insight into a borrower s credit capacity based on current credit behaviors captured on the borrower s credit report which is not self reported or unverified income data. The priority refresh frequency and whether a current lender has the capability to generate the analytic credit capacity index may be customized. Use of the CCI may lead to an improved understanding of debt sensitivity within risk levels which may drive more accurate treatment decisions and higher profits.

The mortgage industry option FICO score may be tailored to be more focused on predicting mortgage related risk. Higher scores may equate to lower future risk of mortgage loan default. The mortgage industry option FICO score may be the base FICO score adjusted to be more predictive of mortgage risk. The mortgage industry option mortgage FICO score may include the same features as base FICO score 3 digit number 300 850 scoring scale same minimum scoring criteria scaled to the same odds to score relationship of base FICO on mortgage performance and usable for credit decisions across the consumer credit lifecycle. The mortgage industry option mortgage FICO score provides the usage features the mortgage industry expects with the added benefit of more accurately predicting mortgage related risk. The priority refresh frequency and whether a current lender has the capability to generate the analytic mortgage industry option mortgage FICO score may be customized.

The mortgage industry option FICO score may uplift the based FICO score by a percentage based on selected borrower populations. For example selected populations may include borrowers having existing mortgages existing mortgages in high risk states existing mortgages but where the borrowers are so called distressed consumers who may be current on a mortgage loan but are heavily indebted sloppy payment of other bills and or have newly booked mortgages. The predictive lift of the mortgage industry option FICO Score over the base FICO in predicting mortgage risk may be based on a random national sample of mortgage loans.

The LPM system maintains a watchlist used to monitor borrowers and classify risks according to predetermined criteria. The LPM system set flags to alert when changes are made to borrower s credit profile and reclassify borrower based on alerts and ensure mortgages that require incremental action are tagged for expedited handling and routed for additional review and action to expedite resolution.

The LPM system may implement a short sale process according to the following engage in borrower contact using dynamic scripting tools confirm investor guidelines for short sale create audit trail that justifies short sale scenario and can be defendable to investor monitor sale of property and update or rescind offer as necessary management reporting and ensure incomplete short sales are tagged for expedited handling and routed for additional review and action to expedite resolution.

The LPM system and loan remediation entity may employ personnel with unique skills and assign the most experienced loan counselors to the most complicated and delinquent loan cases. Borrowers contacts with the call center are seeded with experienced agents capable of fielding a large volume of inquiries. The LPM system leverages a seasoned management team to direct work efforts based on priority. The call center may minimize call wait times and fast path borrowers to live counselors. The call center and loan remediation entity are readily able to implement the loan servicers selected workout strategies and a robust toolset used for campaign management and measurement.

Portfolio management outputs and workout processes may be implemented in very little time and the LPM system may be ramped up to handle large volume with very little lead time. In one example end customers i.e. borrowers may interact with mortgage holders through a client call center. The client call center may provide passive inbound and active outbound customer contact capabilities. In one example the call center may handle inbound contacts by working with borrowers to determine changes in status and route call contact accordingly. In a second example the call center may handle outbound contacts by executing a call campaign to at risk borrowers to sell the borrowers on an optimal loan modification based on campaign recommendations.

The LPM system may provide troubled asset analysis to client call center agents. For example the client call center agents may use the portfolio analyzer borrower health analyzer and campaign generation.

In one example the LPM system may handle internal communication between the client call center and a loan modification processing center. The loan modification processing center may include managers supervisors and other team members experience with process management workload balancing performance management quality assurance training delivery leadership and service management. The loan modification processing center may execute the following processes based on campaign and or portfolio analyzer recommendations debt forgiveness loan modification workout monitor performing loans and take action when key attributes change identify cases in need of special handling exceptions and hand off for appropriate action.

During operation the LPM system may receive from the GSE HASP workout recommendation rules HASP specific NPV calculation thresholds used to categorize watchlist loans. The LPM system may provide a real time view into the quality of the loan portfolio with the ability to analyze the data at various levels of detail and perform what if analysis. The real time view may include historical and projected views of portfolio and loan level performance such as modification success metrics.

The LPM system may use a risk ladder HASP workout recommendations at the loan level operational reports used for customer outreach campaigns and load leveling to route loans to particular servicers. The risk ladder may include a priority ranking of at risk performing default and foreclosure loans. Servicer systems may provide the LPM system with original loan level data trade tape used to run analytics final corrective action decisions and audit trail and updated loan performance information post corrective action .

The LPM system include segment analysis instructions configured to 1 design segmented campaigns that maximize contact with the borrower and encourage default resolution actions by the borrower and 2 create campaigns to target segments of borrowers identified either by the customer via a self directed portal or through the portfolio analyzer results. Borrowers may be contacted according to highly customizable campaign guidelines.

The LPM system may provide BPO support to loan servicers that lack such capabilities by for example performing outbound calls to all customers identified for a specific campaign facilitating the outbound call center to establish contact with borrowers in order to ensure open communication during the default mitigation process. Borrowers may be entered into a campaigns appropriate for to the borrowers situation.

The LPM system may include advanced campaign management tools such as 1 self directed customer portal for initial contact and data collection and 2 ongoing metric monitoring and reporting on campaign success to identify successful strategies and identify trends.
