title: Digital clock with internet connectivity and multiple resting orientations
abstract: A wedge-shaped digital clock wirelessly receives weather, traffic, and other information over the Internet for display along with the time of day. The clock is wedge-shaped so that it can rest in two orientations, one with the display tilted back slightly from vertical and one with the display substantially horizontal. An accelerometer can signal the orientation to an internal processor, which can flip the text on the display as appropriate for the user flipping or turning the housing upside down, for example.

The present application is directed to digital clocks with Internet connectivity and multiple resting orientations.

A wide variety of CE devices such as wireless telephones digital clocks etc. leverage digital processing to provide a multiplicity of useful features to users. The present application understands that such devices may be further enhanced by incorporating accelerometer principles and by being configured with a convenient and useful wedge shape.

Accordingly a consumer electronics CE device includes a wedge shaped housing having a bottom surface and a back surface larger than the bottom surface. A processor is in the housing and a display is on the housing opposite to the back surface. The processor causes the time of day to be presented on the display. A network interface communicates with a wide area computer network and with the processor to enable the processor to present information from the network including weather and traffic information on the display. Also an accelerometer can be the housing to send an orientation signal to the processor. The processor reorients information on the display according to the orientation signal. The housing can be moved by a person between a vertical orientation in which the display is tilted back slightly from vertical and a horizontal orientation in which the display is oriented substantially horizontally.

In example embodiments the bottom surface and back surface are oriented obliquely to each other so that in the vertical orientation the display is slightly canted back from true planar vertical to facilitate easier viewing. The display can be a touch screen and the network interface can be a Wi Fi interface.

If desired a speaker can be provided on the housing and can be controlled by the processor. In specific non limiting examples the speaker is embedded in the bottom surface. The housing may be wider at the bottom surface and tapers inwardly toward an opposite top surface.

The processor can access one or more widgets executable by the processor according to control of the widget. The accelerometer may be located near a corner of the housing distanced from the geometric center of the housing so that it can better sense tilting of the housing.

In another aspect a digital clock includes a wedge shaped housing tapering inwardly from a bottom surface to a top. A back surface of the housing is larger than the bottom surface. A visual display is on the housing opposite to the back surface and a processor in the housing controls the visual display. A network interface is on the housing for coupling the processor to the Internet such that at least weather and traffic information from the Internet is presented on the display by the processor along with a time of day.

In another aspect a method includes orienting a digital clock in a first orientation in which a visual display of the clock is canted slightly back from true vertical and then resting the clock on a surface in the first orientation. The method further includes orienting the clock in a second orientation in which the visual display is substantially horizontal and resting the clock on a surface in the second orientation.

The details of the present invention both as to its structure and operation can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like parts and in which 

Referring initially to a CE device includes a portable lightweight plastic or metal housing . The housing is generally wedge shaped as shown to allow use in a substantially vertical orientation in which the housing rests on a relatively smaller bottom surface and in a substantially horizontal orientation in which the housing rests on a relatively larger back surface . The bottom surface and back surface are oriented obliquely to each other so that in the vertical orientation a visual display such as a 7 inch touch screen on the housing opposite the back surface is slightly canted back from true planar vertical as shown to facilitate easier viewing. On the other hand a person can flip the housing to the horizontal orientation shown in to facilitate visibility of the display while the user is standing e.g. while cooking in the kitchen standing by a desktop etc.

Additionally stereo speakers can be embedded in e.g. the bottom surface as shown in . Also a cavity may be formed in a side surface of the housing that can be covered by a cover . It is to be understood that a universal serial bus USB connector can be in the cavity and can communicate with the below described processor.

In describing the wedge shape perhaps best shows that the housing is wider at the bottom surface and tapers inwardly toward an opposite top surface .

Internal components of the CE device may be seen in . The typically portable lightweight plastic housing bears a digital processor . The processor can control the visual display and speakers . As mentioned above the visual display may be e.g. a capacitive touchscreen display although other display types may be used.

To undertake present principles the processor may access one or more computer readable storage media such as but not limited to disk based or solid state storage. In example non limiting embodiments the media may store various software modules including for example a clock module for presenting a visual indication of time on the display and one or more widgets that may be provided by third parties and or by the manufacturer of the CE device. By widget is meant a portable module of computer software or application that can be installed and executed within for example a HTML based web page by an end user without requiring compilation. Widgets can take the form of on screen tools such as e.g. clocks event countdowns auction tickers stock market tickers flight arrival information daily weather etc .

Additionally the media may store a tilt detection module and one or more feature application s such as an Internet browser for accessing an Internet sourced weather forecast website an Internet sourced traffic information website an Internet sourced radio station and an Internet sourced TV website. Information from these sites may be presented on the displays of the device.

The housing may hold an accelerometer assembly which communicates acceleration signals to the processor for purposes to be shortly disclosed. In one example the accelerometer is a MEMS based accelerometer which outputs signals representing acceleration in each of the three spatial dimensions.

In one example the accelerometer is located near a corner of the housing distanced from the geometric center of the housing so that it can better sense tilting of the housing which typically occurs about a central axis of the housing predominantly in two of the three dimensions i.e. predominantly in the x and y dimensions or the x and z dimensions or the y and z dimensions

Also a computer clock may also be provided to output a time of day signal to the processor for display of the time on the visual display and for e.g. the sounding of a time based alarm on the speakers . If desired a wireless network interface may be in the housing and may communicate with the processor to permit the processor to communicate with a wide area computer network such as the Internet. The interface may be without limitation a Wi Fi interface.

Now referring to a readable presentation in this example the time of day on the display can be flipped as the CE device is turned so that the readable presentation always assumes a default orientation relative to the earth. For example suppose the CE device is vended with the intention that as described above the surface is the top of the housing and the surface the bottom as illustrated in . But if a person flips the housing over as indicated by the arrow so that the bottom surface is now on top present principles permit flipping the readable presentation as shown so that it continues to bear the default orientation with respect to the earth as shown.

Accordingly at block in the readable information is presented on the display in the default orientation in this example an orientation that assumes the housing is resting on the bottom surface . Moving to block the processor receives signals from the accelerometer and executing the tilt module determines the number of degrees through which the CE device has been rotated based thereon. In the example shown the CE device has been flipped 180 degrees so at block the processor rotates the readable information preferably by the same or approximately the same number of degrees the CE device has been flipped e.g. 180 degrees. It is to be understood that present principles apply to e.g. flipping the CE device 90 degrees from the assumed nominal orientation of .

The device may be updated with new or upgraded software downloaded from the Internet through the network interface.

While the particular DIGITAL CLOCK WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND MULTIPLE RESTING ORIENTATIONS is herein shown and described in detail it is to be understood that the subject matter which is encompassed by the present invention is limited only by the claims.
