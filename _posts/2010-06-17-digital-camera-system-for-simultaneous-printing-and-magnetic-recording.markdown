The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in Australian Provisional Patent Application No. PO7991 U.S. Ser. No. 09 113 060 entitled Image Processing Method and Apparatus Art 01 filed 15 Jul. 1997.

The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system hereinafter known as an Artcam type camera wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit ACP which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.

In the preferred embodiment the Artcam device is suitably modified so as to equip it with a microphone device and associated recording technologies. When a picture is taken the opportunity is provided to record either the surrounding sound environment or a message associated with the image. The print media or film is pretreated so as to make it magnetically sensitive in a similar manner to that provided by tape media.

In the preferred embodiment the camera arrangement is also supplied with a sound chip which interfaces via RAMBUS bus to memory under the control of the ACP processor . The sound chip can be of a standard or specialised form and can for example comprise a DSP processor that takes an analogue input from a sound microphone . Alternatively with increasing chip complexities Moore s Law the functionality of sound chip can be incorporated onto the ACP chip which preferably comprises a leading edge CMOS type integrated circuit chip.

It can be seen from the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment that there is provided a system for the automatic recording of audio associated with an output image so as to provide an audio record associated with a photograph printed on ink jet media. There is also disclosed an audio reader system for reading an image recorded on the back of such a photograph.

It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and or modifications any be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. For example the utilisation of more complex audio recording and playback techniques such as stereo and B format techniques. The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.

The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.

The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed and stems from the energy inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02 from electricity input to drop momentum and increased surface area out.

The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19 200 nozzles.

Ideally the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in camera digital color printing and other high quality high speed low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include 

All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.

The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems from battery powered one time use digital cameras through to desktop and network printers and through to commercial printing systems.

For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications the print head is 100 mm long with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38 which is 0.35 mm wide giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19 200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.

Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.

Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.

The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 above.

Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these 45 examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.

Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases a printer may be listed more than once in a table where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.

Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include Home printers Office network printers Short run digital printers Commercial print systems Fabric printers Pocket printers Internet WWW printers Video printers Medical imaging Wide format printers Notebook PC printers Fax machines Industrial printing systems Photocopiers Photographic minilabs etc.

The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.
