title: Recoil dissipation apparatus
abstract: A recoil dissipation apparatus may include a linear roller rail and a roller block that is translatable on the linear roller rail with only one degree of freedom. A gear rack may be located adjacent the linear roller rail. A barrel clamp may be fixed to the roller block. A pinion gear may engage the gear rack. The pinion gear may be fixed on a shaft. The shaft may have a rotary viscous damper fixed at one end. The recoil force from a barrel fixed in the barrel clamp may cause translation of the roller block and dissipation of the recoil force by the rotary viscous damper.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to recoil dissipation and in particular to a recoil dissipation apparatus suitable for an arm of a robot.

Explosive Ordnance Disposal EOD relates to disarming and or neutralizing explosive devices. Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs may be neutralized with a known Percussion Actuated Neutralizer PAN disrupter which may be similar to a firearm.

Current methods for employing a disputer may require the EOD operator to manually set up the PAN disrupter. The EOD operator may be within three feet of the IED. The EOD operator may be exposed to harm because there may a nearby alternate ambush device or the IED may be monitored and detonated with a remote detonator. A dummy inert IED may be used to lure the EOD operator into an area that is being watched by a sniper. The IED may be a timed IED and the EOD operator may be there when the timed IED detonates.

Robotic operation of the PAN disrupter may not be possible on Man Transportable Robotic System MTRS robots due to high recoil produced by the type of charge the PAN employs. Recoil caused by a PAN disrupter hard mounted onto MTRS robots may cause robot arm failure and robot damage. Past solutions have had shortcomings in eliminating enough recoil to allow safe controlled deployment of the PAN disrupter on the robot arm.

One known mount uses a friction brake which converts the recoil energy into heat via a friction clamp that allows translation of the barrel. The friction brake was determined to reduce the recoil by only 85 . Another type of mount on a similar mechanism employs a brake shoe construction that resulted in only 82 recoil reduction when mounted on a test stand. With the known mounts the robot arm may be subject to 500 pounds or more of force when firing the PAN disrupter. A need exists for an apparatus to absorb or dissipate the recoil of a PAN disrupter that is mounted to a robot.

It is an object of the invention to provide a recoil dissipation apparatus suitable for an arm of a robot.

One aspect of the invention is a recoil dissipation apparatus. The recoil dissipation apparatus may include a linear roller rail a roller block translatable on the linear roller rail with only one degree of freedom a rack adjacent the linear roller rail a barrel clamp fixed to the roller block a pinion gear engaged with the rack and fixed on a shaft and a rotary viscous damper fixed to the shaft.

The recoil dissipation apparatus may include a roller block buffer at one end of the linear roller rail and a barrel clamp lock at another end of the linear roller rail. The barrel clamp lock may include a magnet and the roller block buffer may include a spring.

The barrel clamp may include front and rear barrel fixtures separated by a gap. The shaft may be disposed in the gap. The pinion gear and the rotary viscous damper may be disposed on opposite sides of the barrel clamp.

The recoil dissipation apparatus may include a mount for connecting the apparatus to a second apparatus. The second apparatus may be a robot.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring to a recoil dissipation apparatus may include a linear roller rail . A roller block may be translatable on linear roller rail with only one degree of freedom. A rack may be disposed adjacent linear roller rail . A barrel clamp may be fixed to roller block using for example fasteners . The barrel of a PAN disrupter not shown may be fixed in barrel clamp . Barrel clamp may include a front barrel fixture and a rear barrel fixture having openings . Front and rear barrel fixtures may be joined with a plate .

Disposed inside pinion gear shield or housing may be a pinion gear . Pinion gear may be engaged with rack . Pinion gear may be fixed on a shaft . A rotary viscous damper RVD may be fixed to shaft .

A roller block buffer may be disposed at one end of linear roller rail . Roller block buffer may include a spring . One end of roller block may include a buffer plate shown exploded in for contacting roller block buffer .

A barrel clamp lock shown exploded in may be disposed at another end of linear roller rail . A bracket may be used to attach barrel clamp lock to rail . Barrel clamp lock may be a permanent magnet. Barrel clamp lock may provide a magnetic attractive force to the barrel clamp to maintain the recoil dissipation apparatus in the firing position. After firing of the PAN or other firearm that may be fixed in barrel clamp recoil dissipation apparatus may be manually returned to the firing position.

Front and rear barrel fixtures may be separated by a gap . Shaft may be disposed in gap . Pinion gear and RVD may be disposed on opposite sides of barrel clamp .

Recoil dissipation apparatus may include a mount for connecting the apparatus to a second apparatus. The mount may be located on an underside of linear roller rail . In the embodiment shown the mount may include a pair of grabbers and for connecting to a MIL STD 1913 rail . The second apparatus may be for example a robot shown schematically having a robot arm .

A known RVD may include a rotor fixed to shaft a stationary housing and a fluid inside the housing . Fluid may be sheared as rotor rotates. Fluid may be a silicone based fluid. A suitable fluid may be for example Standard VV D 1078 Polydimethylsiloxane Fluid CAS 63148 62 9 having a kinematic viscosity of 10 000 cSt.

Barrel clamp may receive a PAN barrel or another type of barrel. Barrel clamp may be manually positioned so that barrel clamp lock is adjacent barrel clamp . Barrel clamp lock may hold barrel clamp in the position shown in using magnetic force for example. This is the starting position prior to firing the PAN disrupter or other firearm. When the PAN disrupter or other firearm is fired the resulting recoil energy may be transferred into work via the motion of recoil dissipation apparatus .

Recoil force from the PAN or other firearm may be transmitted to barrel clamp and may cause roller block to translate on linear roller rail and pinion gear to move on rack . Pinion gear may rotate shaft which may be connected to RVD . Thus linear translation of the roller block may be directed into rotational work via RVD . The transferring of recoil energy into work may effect a reduction in the resulting force of the recoil. RVD may provide smooth control. RVD may provide the recoil damping by shearing fluid .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
