The use of wireless local area or personal area networks within home and business environments such as for example WiFi and Bluetooth is growing at an ever increasing rate. Such networks provide not only connectivity with other devices such as printers computers and cell phones for example but many times provide access through devices such as for example wireless routers and switches information service providers located outside the premises via broadband network connections such as a digital subscriber line DSL a cable broadband service and local multi point distribution service LMDS . Although the percentage of homes and businesses with access to such broadband services is expanding there are still large numbers of users that have conventional dialup access to information providers but cannot get broadband service or for which broadband service is cost prohibitive. Such users may find dialup speed access to information satisfactory but may also wish to enjoy the flexibility and the added mobility within their living and work spaces that may be available using a wireless local area network.

Aspects of the present invention related to the exchange of data over a dialup communication network employing the Internet protocol IP . More specifically aspects of the present invention relate to a means of supporting flexible premises access to a dialup communication link using wireless local area network technology.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention a user of an electronic device such as for example the PC of may desire the freedom to move about their residence or place of business while using the PC to access information resources accessible via the PSTN . Conventional access points and routers that allow wireless access to the information resources of a wireless network typically do so via an Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 broadband communication link a digital subscriber line DSL a cable television network or a satellite network. A representative embodiment of the present invention permits a user of an electronic device such as PC without access to one of the above broadband data networks to enjoy mobility within the coverage area of a wireless local area or personal area network using a conventional telephone network such as for example the PSTN .

The terminal adapter of the communication system of comprises a processor with code . The processor is communicatively coupled to a wireless interface for communicating via RF air interface and a PSTN line interface for communicating via the PSTN network . The wireless interface functions at least to exchange digital information via the RF air interface according to for example an IEEE 802.11a b g and or n and or IEEE 802.15.3a wireless network protocol. The PSTN line interface functions at least to exchange digital data and signaling information between the processor and the analog signaling used by the PSTN . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the communication of information via the PSTN may employ for example a point to point protocol such as the protocol described in Internet Engineering Task Force IETF document RFC 1661 1994 .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention the processor may cause digitized audio information to be exchanged between the wireless interface and the audio interface conveying digital representations of network and modem signaling between the modem and the terminal adapter via the RF air interface . The signals communicated with the PC adapter via link may be the same as those normally used in accessing an information provider when the modem is in direct communication with a telephone subscriber loop such as for example the telephone subscriber loop . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the code of the processor may be arranged to cause the exchange of the digital representations of network and modem signaling between the wireless interface and the PSTN line interface . The PSTN line interface may function to convert between the analog signals used in communication via the PSTN and the digital representations of network and modem signaling received and transmitted by the modem of the PC .

The terminal adapter of the communication system A of comprises a processor with machine readable storage containing code . The processor is communicatively coupled to a wireless interface for communicating via RF air interface and to a dialup modem and PSTN line interface for communicating via the PSTN network . The wireless interface functions at least to exchange digital information via the RF air interface according to for example an IEEE 802.11a b g and or n and or IEEE 802.15.3a wireless network protocol. The dialup modem and PSTN line interface function at least to exchange digital data and signaling information between the processor and the analog signaling used by the PSTN .

In one representative embodiment of the present invention the code of the processor may for example comprise a software application a conventional operating system software to interface between the operating system and the hardware circuitry of the PC e.g. a wireless interface such as a set of drivers and other application code as is used for communication via conventional wireless local area and personal area communication networks. For example the code may comprise an Internet browser such as the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser application by Microsoft Corporation and may operate in cooperation with a compatible operating system such as for example the Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation and driver software to communicate via the RF air interface . Such communication may be the same as that occurring when the PC operates in a wireless local area or personal area network supported by a broadband gateway access point or router providing wireless local area or personal area network access a broadband network such as for example a DSL cable television or satellite network as described above. In a representative embodiment of the present invention however broadband network access may not be available. Such a representative embodiment may employ a dial up connection such as the dial up link supported by the PSTN line interface linked via the conventional telephone loop to the PSTN network for example. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the code of processor may be configured to operate as though in a wireless local area network LAN situation and may not involve the use of dial up manager software as described above with respect to the communication systems of and .

The terminal adapter in such a representative embodiment in accordance with the present invention may for example function so as to intercept and analyze e.g. parse hypertext transfer protocol HTTP messaging received by the wireless interface e.g. from the PC in order to recognize a universal resource locator URL of a particular form. The interception and analysis e.g. parsing of HTTP messaging from the PC by the terminal adapter may be enabled for example only when the processor determines that the PSTN line interface is not currently off hook or that the modem is not currently engaged in communication.

In such a representative embodiment of the present invention the particular form of the URL to be recognized may include an indication that a dialable directory number is embedded within the URL for example and that the HTTP request represents a user request to establish a modem link with a dialup service provider. For example in one representative embodiment of the present invention a URL of the form http DIAL.1.630.555.1212 may be interpreted by the terminal adapter as a request to dial the directory number 1 630 555 1212 . In another representative embodiment a URL of the form http DIAL may cause the terminal adapter to respond to the web browser application at the PC with appropriate hypertext markup language HTML for the display of a web page prompting for entry of a directory number to be dialed.

In another representative embodiment of the present invention the code of processor in the PC of may be configured to operate as though in a dial up situation and may employ conventional dial up manager software such as that described above with respect to the communication systems of and . In such a representative embodiment a conventional dialup manager in the code may for example employ interface code in the PC that communicates with the code of the processor in the terminal adapter via the wireless interface RF air interface and wireless interface . Instead of directly managing a dialup modem such as for example the dialup modems of and the interface code may permit application software such as for example a dialup manager or Internet browser on the PC to control the behavior of the modem and line interface in the terminal adapter as though they resided within or were in direct local communication with the PC . Such interface code may support the use of the RF air interface for the exchange between the processor and the processor of information to from the PSTN from to a software application and of status and control information related to the establishment and management of a dialup network connection by the application software on the PC .

As shown in the illustration of the code may comprise application code operating system O S code and interface code that may handle the exchange of information for the application code and O S code . The application code may comprise for example an Internet browser application and a dialup manager as described above with respect to and . The operating system code may provide an application program interface API that permits the application code to access the hardware of the PC such as for example the wireless interface by employing the interface code that may handle the exchange of data via the wireless interface and interface code that may handle the exchange of status and control information associated with establishment and maintenance of a dialup modem link. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the application code may function in a dialup fashion via the wireless link provided by the wireless interface RF air interface and wireless interface without requiring changes to the application code from that used with a dialup modem that is local to the PC . The API provided by the operating system and employed by the application code may be unchanged from that employed in communication systems such as those shown in and . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the interface code may be arranged to make the remotely located modem and PSTN line interface appear as a dialup modem local to the PC . The interface code may be arranged to cooperatively use the wireless interface to exchange both data and status and control information via the RF air interface with the terminal adapter .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention the code of the terminal adapter of may comprise operating code and interface code . The interface code may for example function to cooperatively exchange data and status and control information via the wireless interface RF air interface and the wireless interface with the interface code respectively in the code of for example the PC . The communication of status and control information between the interface code at the PC for example and the interface code in the terminal adapter for example permits the application code to establish and maintain a dialup modem link using the modem and line interface of terminal adapter for example as if the dialup modem functionality were physically present at the PC . For example a user of a software application such as for example an Internet browser may wish to establish a dialup link to an Internet service provider ISP via a public switched telephone network connection like the PSTN . The user may employ a dialup manager such as that provided by the Windows operating system for example and may provide a directory number associated with the ISP. The status and control information normally exchanged between application code such as the application code e.g. an Internet browser and a dialup modem resident on a PC such as for example the PC of may instead be exchanged with the hardware circuitry of the modem and the PSTN line interface via the operating system the interface code the wireless interface the RF air interface the wireless interface the interface code and the operating code .

A representative embodiment of the present invention may convey out of band status and control signals such as for example request to send RTS and clear to send CTS that may for example be used in an information flow control mechanism by communicating such status and control information between the interface code of the PC and the interface code of terminal adapter . For example the terminal adapter may have limited buffer space for the transmission of application data via the PSTN . Application code and or O S code may for example employ RTS CTS flow control in managing information flow when in communication using a dialup modem on a PC such as for example a PC with a directly connected dialup modem. A representative embodiment of the present invention may convey out of band status and control signals such as for example RTS CTS data set ready DSR data terminal ready DTR CD carrier detect ring indicator RI and a variety of others between a terminal adapter such as the terminal adapter of and a PC such as the PC of by employing the interface code the wireless interfaces and the RF air interface . The states and or transitions of out of band signals such as those listed above may be represented in messaging exchanged between the interface code at the PC and the interface code at the terminal adapter . In this manner the application code and or O S may exchange such status and control information with the remotely located modem and PSTN line interface via the interface code and operating code . This permits a representative embodiment of the present invention to wirelessly communicate flow control and other out of band signals between a PC at a first location and a terminal adapter at a second location via a wireless LAN.

Another representative embodiment of the present invention may support in band signaling supporting functionality such as for example flow control. In such an arrangement the interface code at the PC and the interface code at the terminal adapter may for example be cognizant of predefined values of data employed by the application code and or O S for flow control purposes. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the interface code on PC and the interface code may support in band signaling for flow control and similar functionality. For example data values representing industry conventions XON and XOFF e.g. DC1 hexadecimal 11 and DC2 hexadecimal 13 may be employed. Other data values and in band signaling functionality may also be supported without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

In a similar fashion the data that might typically be exchanged between the application code e.g. the Internet browser and an ISP using an internal or directly connected dialup modem of a PC such as the PC of for example may instead be exchanged with the ISP via the operating system the interface code the wireless interface the RF air interface the wireless interface the interface code the operating code the modem and the PSTN line interface . Together the interface code and the operating code may for example operate to perform adaptation of the protocol used over the wireless interface e.g. TCP IP from to the protocol used for data information exchanged via the PSTN network connection using the modem and PSTN line interface such as for example support of a point to point PPP dialup protocol such as the IETF RFC 1661 protocol described above. Although the above discussion has provided an example where the application code comprises an Internet browser this does not represent a specific limitation of the present invention. A representative embodiment of the present invention may be employed with a variety of software applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

The terminal adapter of the communication system of comprises a processor with machine readable storage containing code . The processor is communicatively coupled to a wireless interface for communicating via RF air interface and to a dialup modem and PSTN line interface for communicating via the subscriber loop and the PSTN network . The wireless interface functions at least to exchange digital information via the RF air interface according to for example an IEEE 802.11a b g and or n and or IEEE 802.15.3a wireless network protocol. The dialup modem and PSTN line interface function at least to convert digital data and signaling information between the processor and the analog signaling compatible with the PSTN .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention the terminal interface may support access by either or both of PC and PC to dialup information service providers via the PSTN . A representative embodiment of the present invention may also support communication between the PC and the PC via air interface and wired link .

Upon receipt of the message it is determined whether a dialup connection via for example the modem and the PSTN line interface is already established block . If a dialup connection is already established the received message may be forwarded via the dialup connection block . If however a dialup connection is not already established a check is made whether the universal resource locator URL in the message matches a URL designated for use in establishing dialup connections such as for example http DIAL block . If the URL in the message is not the designated URL the message may be ignored and the method of may end block . If however the URL does match the designated URL a check may be made to determine whether the terminal adapter is waiting for a response from the user of the web browser that is wirelessly communicatively coupled to the terminal adapter . If the terminal adapter is not waiting for a user response the terminal adapter may send a web page prompting the user to enter the directory number of a dialup information service provider block .

If the terminal adapter is waiting for a user response a determination is made whether the message contains a directory number block . If the message does not contain a directory number the message may be ignored and the method of ends block . If the received message does contain a directory number the terminal adapter dials the directory number block and establishes a connection with the dialup information service provider block . The method of then ends block . Although the illustration of shows the method as ending the method may be part of a loop that is repeatedly performed in order to cause communication of messages between the wireless interface and the PSTN line interface for example.

At another time the application code may desire to check the status of the dialup modem and may perform an API call to the O S of the PC requesting status of the dialup modem block . This may include for example whether all information has been sent or whether dial tone or a carrier of a distant modem has been detected. The O S may pass the status request and any parameter s involved to the dialup modem driver block . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the dialup modem driver may for example direct such a status request over a wireless network instead of directly accessing status information from a local dialup modem connected to the PC. The dialup modem driver may package the status request and any parameter s involved into a message for transmission via the wireless network block . The dialup modem driver may identify the message type as a status request message block . The message may then be queued for transmission to a terminal adapter such as for example the terminal adapter of block .

At yet another time the application code may desire to send application data via the communication link provided by the dialup modem and may perform an API call to the O S of the PC for transmission of application data block . The application data may comprise for example a query of a remote database or information send by an Internet browser. The O S may pass the application data and any parameter s involved to the dialup modem driver block . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the dialup modem driver may for example direct the application data and parameter s over a wireless network instead of directly transmitting the application data via a local dialup modem connected to the PC. The dialup modem driver may package the application data and any parameter s involved into a message for transmission via the wireless network block and may identify the message type as an application data message block . The message may then be queued for transmission to a terminal adapter such as for example the terminal adapter of block .

If the terminal adapter determines that the received message is a status request message block the terminal adapter may determine the status of the dialup modem of the terminal adapter block . The terminal adapter e.g. the terminal adapter may then package the requested status information into a message for transmission to the PC via the wireless network block . The message may be identified by the terminal adapter as being a status information type message block and may then be queued for transmission to the PC via the wireless network block . The method of then ends block .

If the terminal adapter determines that the received message is an application data type message block the terminal adapter may convert the format of the message from that used for the protocol of the wireless network to that used for the protocol of the dialup network block . This may involve conversion from a packet protocol for use on an IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN to a point to point protocol PPP or other protocol suitable for use via a ANSI V.92 dialup modem connection for example. The terminal adapter e.g. the terminal adapter may package status information about the processing and transmission of the application data via the dialup modem link into a message for transmission to the PC via the wireless network block that may be identified as a status information type message block . The status information message may be queued for transmission to the PC for example via the wireless network block . The method of then ends block .

If data has been receive via the dialup modem link block the terminal adapter may convert the received data from dialup protocol format to a format suitable for use on the wireless local area network linking the terminal adapter and the PC block . The terminal adapter may then identify the message as an application data message block and may queue the message for transmission to the PC via the wireless network block . The method of then ends block .

If the interface code determines that the received message is application data block the interface code e.g. driver software may pass the application data to the O S block that may then provide the application data to the application code that originated the API call block . The application code may then process the received application data as though it was received from a dialup modem local to the PC block . The method illustrated in then ends block .
