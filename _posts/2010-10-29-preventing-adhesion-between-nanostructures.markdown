Subject matter described herein was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011 09 3 0002 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.

Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering SERS is a technique using Raman scattering for enhancing the detection of molecular species through the excitation of Plasmon modes and their coupling to molecular vibrational modes. In other words Raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of photons that can provide vibrational fingerprints of molecules.

Nanostructures on a substrate where the detection of molecular species takes place affects the Raman scattering. In particular when the nanostructures are adhered together the Raman scattering can be negatively affected.

The drawings referred to in this description should be understood as not being drawn to scale except if specifically noted.

Reference will now be made in detail to examples of the present technology examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the technology will be described in conjunction with various example s it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present technology to these examples. On the contrary the present technology is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope of the various examples as defined by the appended claims.

Furthermore in the following description of examples numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However the present technology may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present examples.

Nanostructures are disposed on substrate . It should be appreciated that any number of nanostructures are disposed in various orientations on substrate . In various examples the shapes of the nanostructures can be but are not limited to conical cylindrical and the like. It should be appreciated nanostructures can be any shape that facilitates in the enhancement of Raman scattering. In one example nanostructures are flexible such that nanostructures may come into contact with neighboring nanostructures.

SERS active metals are disposed at least on a portion of nanostructures . In general SERS active metals are metals that help provide for the enhancement of Raman scattering during SERS.

In one example SERS active metals are disposed on a tip portion of nanostructures . It should be appreciated that a SERS active metal can be disposed on nanostructures in any fashion to facilitate in enhancing Raman scattering. For example SERS active metal can be deposited as a uniform thin layer on all of the nanostructures. SERS active metals can be but are not limited to silver gold platinum or copper.

Low friction film is to prevent adhesion between nanostructures . In contrast in conventional technology oftentimes nanostructures in close proximity to one another adhere to one another. Accordingly SERS is negatively affected. Moreover long term use of SERS devices is also negatively affected.

The adhesion between nanostructures is often due to van der Waals forces between the nanostructures. Additionally nanostructures may be brought together via microcapillary forces.

Low friction film is disposed over SERS active metals and nanostructures . In one example low friction film has a thickness of 2 nanometers or less.

Low friction film can be but is not limited to CF CF and diamond like carbon. It should be appreciated that low friction film is any film that includes low interaction forces and is able to prevent adhesion between nanostructures. In particular low friction film is an film that prevents adhesion due to van der Waals forces.

Low friction film may be deposited on nanostructures and SERS active metals in a variety of ways. For example low friction film may be deposited by but not limited to vapor deposition chemical vapor deposition CVD plasma CVD molecule self assembly atomic layer deposition and the like.

Nanostructure detacher is to detach nanostructures that are attached to one another. For example if nanostructures and are adhered together due to van der Waals forces nanostructure detacher facilitates in detaching nanostructures and . It should be appreciated that nanostructure detacher can be disposed at any location with respect to devices or such that it is able to facilitate in detaching nanostructures.

In one example nanostructure detacher is a piezoelectric substrate to excite attached nanostructures to a resonant vibration frequency. Once the nanostructures are detached from one another the resonant frequency is shifted or reduced. Also the amplitude may be limited because once the nanostructures are detached their resonant vibration frequency will be shifted and the nanostructures cannot absorb any more energy from the vibration excitation source.

In another example nanostructure detacher is a heat source that thermally expands the attached nanostructures. For example the thermal expansion of the attached nanostructures can overcome van der Waals forces and result in detaching of the nanostructures.

In a further example nanostructure detacher is a magnet e.g. electro magnet that provides a magnetic field. For example a magnetic field provided to the attached nanostructure can facilitate in the attached nanostructures to overcome van der Waals forces and result in detaching of the nanostructures.

At a SERS active metal is disposed on a portion of the plurality of nanostructures. For example gold is disposed on a tip portion of nanostructures .

At a low friction film is disposed over the plurality of nanostructures and the SERS active metal wherein the low friction film is for preventing adhesion between the plurality of nanostructures. For example low friction film is uniformly disposed over nanostructures and SERS active metals to prevent adhesion between nanostructures due to van der Waals forces. In various examples the low friction film can be but is not limited to CF CF and diamond like carbon.

At attached nanostructures are detached from one another. For example nanostructures and are adhered to one another due to van der Waals forces as depicted in . However nanostructure detacher facilitates in detaching nanostructures and . Accordingly nanostructures and are not attached to one another as depicted in .

In one example at the attached nanostructures are excited to a resonant vibration frequency. For example a vibration excitation source e.g. piezoelectric substrate excites attached nanostructures and to a resonant vibration frequency to facilitate in the detaching of nanostructures and .

In another example at the attached nanostructures are thermally expanded. For example a heat source provides heat to attached nanostructures and to facilitate in the detaching of nanostructures and .

In a further example at a magnetic field is provided to the attached nanostructures. For example attached nanostructures and are provided with a magnetic field to facilitate in the detaching of nanostructures and .

Various examples of the present technology are thus described. While the present technology has been described in particular examples it should be appreciated that the present technology should not be construed as limited by such examples but rather construed according to the following claims.
