Existing application programs such as web browsers include or host executable code from third parties. The executable code allows the third parties to for example access resource and or collect data available from the computing device. Although such existing application programs often provide enhanced user experiences these application programs also raise security and privacy issues. For example existing mobile computing devices such as cellular telephones or personal digital assistants PDA have global positioning system GPS capabilities. Executable code on these devices may include programs or scripts e.g. such as executed by a web browser designed to request or even steal vulnerable information such as location information e.g. global positioning system information from the mobile computing device.

Some existing systems include separate layered access policy rules for controlling access by application programs to device resources. For example if a user authorizes a browser to access particular resources on a mobile computing device and if the browser exposes that capability to web pages then every web page malicious or not rendered by the browser has access to the particular resources. Additionally operating systems within the existing systems may also provide a policy system to administer these access constraints. However the existing systems lack among other things more granular control over access to the resources.

Embodiments of the disclosure manage access by an entity associated with an execution extension environment to location information on a first computing device. Upon a request for location information of a first mobile computing device form the entity the access rights of the entity for the requested location information are accessed and a request to authorize the entity access to the requested location information is sent to a second mobile computing device where access to the requested location information is enabled based on a response from the second mobile computing device.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Referring to the figures embodiments of the disclosure enable a third party to control access rights to a resource e.g. location information by an entity executing within an application program e.g. a global positioning system application program on a computing device . In some embodiments the application program represents a parent application program executing on a first mobile computing device and the entity represents a child application program or other executable code e.g. a web page hosted by a browser . The present disclosure enables discrimination among web pages e.g. the entity requesting access to location information associated with the first mobile computing device . Thus upon a request from the entity to access location information associated with the first mobile computing device a determination is made by the third party as to whether the entity is allowed access to the requested location information or denied access to the requested location information.

For example a first user e.g. a child or employee of the first mobile computing device executing a browser may navigate to a map web site and later navigates to a social networking related web site. The present disclosure provides a second user e.g. a parent of the child or a boss of the employee an ability to authorize restrict or refuse access by particular entities to the resource . For example the present disclosure enables the second user to authorize the map web site to have access to the requested location information of the first mobile computing device while refusing access by the social networking related web site to the requested location information associated with the first mobile computing device . As such aspects of the present disclosure enable the second user to create different access rights for the same browser executing on the first mobile computing device a first set of access rights or profile for the map web site and a second set of access rights or profile for the social networking related web site.

The second user may also selectively restrict access to a particular location of the first mobile computing device based on the current location of the first mobile computing device . For example the second user may allow location information of the first mobile computing device to restrict access if the first mobile computing device and therefore the first user is located on school property. At the same time the second user may provide unlimited access to the location information of the first mobile computing device to family members. Thus the present disclosure enables a user that has authority e.g. the second user over another user e.g. the first user an ability to control the access rights of the first mobile computing device associated with the first user.

While some embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated and described herein with reference to the first mobile computing device and the second mobile computing device being a mobile computing device such as a mobile telephone aspects of the disclosure are operable with any device that performs the functionality illustrated and described herein or its equivalent. For example embodiments of the disclosure are operable with netbooks desktop computing devices laptop computers portable gaming consoles and other computing devices. In such embodiments the access rights may be stored by a cloud service and accessible by any device of a user.

Referring again to the first mobile computing device is connected to the second mobile computing device and a server via a network . In some embodiments the server is a peer computing device and the first mobile computing device and the peer computing device are in a peer to peer relationship. The first mobile computing device stores one or more access rights for the one or more resources including but not limited to location information e.g. global positioning system coordinates documents and the like. A location provider may communicate with the first mobile computing device and the second mobile computing device through the Internet e.g. the network . Other channels of communication between the location provider and the first mobile computing device and the second mobile computing device are possible. For example communication may occur via the short message service SMS . In another example the location provider may communicate with the first mobile computing device and the second mobile computing device through local area networks or direct communication such as land based lines or wireless telephone connections. Thus while illustrates communication via the network it is for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be a limitation on the present disclosure.

One or more application programs such as a web browser execute on the first mobile computing device and provide an execution environment for other executable code such as hosted entities one or more child application programs e.g. nested or not or any other executable code associated with the application programs . While the entity is shown in to be within or hosted by the application program the entity may be located separate from the first mobile computing device .

Referring next to an exemplary block diagram illustrates a computing device such as the first mobile computing device or other first computing device having a memory area at least one processor and a display . The display may be for example a display device separate from the computing device a display integrated into the computing device e.g. such as in a mobile telephone a capacitive touch screen display or a non capacitive display. User input functionality may also be provided in the display where the display acts as a user input selection device such as in a touch screen. While is an exemplary block diagram of the computing device one or more additional computing devices in communication with the computing device may also include similar features described herein.

In some embodiments the memory area or other computer readable medium or media stores the resources and the access rights and the application program hosts the entity seeking access to the resource . In other embodiments the resources such as a GPS receiver using BLUETOOTH brand wireless communication exist external to the computing device . An entity identifier associated with the entity may be used to determine whether to provide access to one or more of the resources .

To control access to the resources each request for the resource is evaluated against the access rights . In an example the resource is a location resource e.g. providing location information describing the computing device . The access rights identify the type and depth of access by the entity to the resource . In one embodiment the entity may have read only access read write access or no access to the resource . In a further embodiment the access rights may include a request to delegate the decision regarding access to the resources to a second user e.g. a parent via another computing device e.g. a second computing device such as the second mobile computing device from . For example upon a request from the entity to access location information of the computing device the second user may be prompted to authorize or deny access to the location information of the computing device . The authorization request may be sent by various means including but not limited to SMS email automated voice message or an application built into the other computing device. In one embodiment the type of information describing the entity making the request or any other information the second user deems relevant is determined by the second user via the other computing device. For example the second user may prefer authorization requests to identify information regarding for example the name of the requesting entity the location of the computing device an indication as to whether a request was sent and or received from an additional mobile computing device e.g. the other parent and a quantity of times the particular request has been made. In one embodiment the first user is prompted with a message on the first mobile computing device that authorization has been sent to the second mobile computing device and or authorization is pending.

While the access rights shown in are stored in the memory area on the computing device one or more of the access rights may be stored remotely from the computing device . For example the access rights may be stored in a cloud service not shown a database or other memory area accessible by the computing device .

The memory area further stores one or more computer executable components. Exemplary components include but are not limited to an interface component a permissions component an access component and an accuracy component . The components may be individual components in some embodiments or grouped together into a single component in other embodiments. While the components are shown to be stored in the memory area the components may be stored and executed from a memory area remote from the computing device . For example the components may be stored by a cloud service and the output of the execution of the components may be provided to the computing device . Such embodiments reduce the computational and storage burden on the computing device .

The interface component when executed by the processor causes the processor to communicate with the other computing device to obtain data that defines the access rights . For example the interface component receives input from the other computing device that defines for example an expiration value for the access rights e.g. yes for one year or no during school hours . In the present example the second user associated with the other computing device may specify that the access rights are based on geographic and or time based restrictions such that location information of the computing device is provided if the location of the first user is within or without a prescribed geographic area when a location request is received that falls within a time based restriction parameter contained in the access rights . In another example the second user may enable access to the requested location information if the first user is within a predefined distance from the second user.

Further the second user may specify that the access rights are only for the current request a current session or for a defined period of time e.g. a day the next ten days five minutes or any other user specified period of time . In one embodiment the interface component includes one or more user interfaces for receiving user input from a user via a keyboard touch display mouse or other user input selection devices. Thus the interface component may include a user interface to receive direct user input to define the access rights .

The permissions component when executed by the processor causes the processor to receive identify or otherwise access one or more of the access rights . The permissions component may also store and maintain some or all the access rights .

The access component when executed by the processor causes the processor to receive a request for the resource from the entity compare the received request to the access rights received by the permissions component and grant the entity access to the resource based on the comparing. For example the access component compares the received request to each of the access rights available to the permissions component . If a match is found e.g. one of the access rights matches the received request the access component evaluates and applies the access rights . If however access rights are not found in the access rights the access component communicates with the interface component to prompt the second user via the other computing device to define the access rights . For example the prompt seeks to obtain authorization from the second user to enable the entity access the resource on the computing device . The prompt may also provide a never allow access option to persist the access rights received from the user an always allow access option or an option for allowing access for a defined time period e.g. two weeks . In such an instance a new policy set is created and stored in the memory area with the other access rights .

The accuracy component when executed by the processor causes the processor to define a level of accuracy of the requested location information exposed to the entity . For example if is determined by for example by the second user via the access rights that the accuracy of the requested location information needs to be reduced then the accuracy component reduces e.g. fuzzes the accuracy of the requested location information.

The processor executes computer executable instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure. For example the processor receives from the second user for example the access rights to the resource and associates the received access rights with the entity . The processor operates to store the created access rights in the memory area .

In some embodiments the processor is transformed into a special purpose microprocessor by executing computer executable instructions or by otherwise being programmed. For example the processor is programmed with instructions such as illustrated next in .

Referring next to an exemplary flow chart illustrates access control for the resource . While described with reference to the first mobile computing device and the second mobile computing device the operations illustrated in are applicable to computing devices other than mobile computing devices. At a request for location information of the first mobile computing device is received. In some embodiments the access rights also include data defining what information the entity is authorized to obtain from the resource and which purposes for the data are authorized. For example as mentioned above the second user may specify via the second mobile computing device access rights regarding if and when a particular web site may obtain location information about the first mobile computing device .

At the access rights of the entity to the requested location information are accessed. The access rights identify the type and depth of access by the entity to the resource . In one embodiment the access rights may be predefined by the second user based on for example a type of entity making a request for location information a day of the week a time of day and a location of the first mobile computing device . Thus the second user may restrict all access to the requested location information during school hours and allow access to the requested location information to specific entities outside of school hours. The second user may also enable or restrict access to the requested location information based on a proximity of the first mobile computing device to the second mobile computing device . For example the second user may enable access to any requested location information if the first mobile computing device is within a predefined distance from the second mobile computing device . In a further embodiment the second user may require that all requests for location information be sent to the second mobile computing device before access is granted or denied. Thus upon a request from the entity to access location information of the first mobile computing device the second user is prompted via the second mobile computing device to authorize or deny access to the location information of the first mobile computing device .

For example at a determination is made as to whether the entity has access to the requested location information. The access rights are examined to determine whether to grant or deny access by the entity to the resource . In one embodiment the entity is granted access to the resource based on the determination. For example if the access rights indicate that the entity is allowed to access the resource the request is granted. Alternatively if the access rights specify that the entity should not be allowed access the request is denied. The absence of a matching access rights may indicate that the request should be denied. For example if a matching access right is not identified the entity is denied access to the resource . However if a matching access right is not identified access to the requested location information may be enabled or restricted based on a previous response from the second mobile computing device at . At access to the requested location information based on a response from the second mobile computing device is enabled.

In some embodiments if the second user authorizes access a new access right is added to the access rights . Therefore in a subsequent check for access by the same application program with the same entity to the same resource the access right is matched first and access is granted or denied based upon the previous response from the second user. Upon a denial a first user may send a message to the second user regarding why access should be granted and request reconsideration of the decision. The message may be sent by SMS email automated voice message an application built into the second mobile computing device or other forms and means of communication.

In some embodiments if a response from the second user via the second mobile computing device is not received within a predefined period of time then a request for authorization may be sent to another user for example a designated contact identified by the second user.

Referring next to an exemplary flow diagram illustrates an alternative embodiment of the disclosure. In this example controlling access to location information on the first mobile computing device can be implemented into a location application programming interface API executed on the first mobile computing device . In this example the location API obtains and provides location information to a requesting application program e.g. the entity . Thus in one embodiment an API available on the first mobile computing device can be modified to control access to a resource e.g. location information on the first mobile computing device .

For example at the application program requests location information from the location API on the first mobile computing device . Upon receiving the request the location API checks a database e.g. the access rights for permission to access the requested location information at . At if permission information is found at it is determined whether permission to access the requested location information is granted. If it is determined from the permission information that access to the requested location information is not granted at the location API denies the request by the application to access the requested location information. However at if it is determined that permission to access the requested location information is granted at it is determined whether the accuracy of the requested location information is going to be reduced or fuzzed. For example in one embodiment a parent via the mobile computing device can specify a level of granularity of the location information of the first mobile computing device that is given to a requesting application. Thus if it is determined that the accuracy of the requested location information is going to be fuzzed at the accuracy of the location information is reduced or degraded via for example the accuracy component . On the other hand if it is determined that the requested location information is not going to be adjusted at the location API provides the requested location information to the requesting application without performing any degrading or fuzzing.

In embodiments if permission to access the requested location information is not found at a message is sent from the first mobile computing device to a third party e.g. the second mobile computing device requesting permission to allow the requesting application access to the requested location information. In one embodiment the message includes additional information such as you said yes last time or Dad said it was ok. In this example the child can personalize the message sent to the parent either manually or by enabling an option on the first mobile computing device that tracks such previous authorizations and or denials and automatically formulates a personalized message.

At the requesting application is notified that a decision to grant the application access to the requested location information is pending. At if it is determined that the third party grants access to the requested location information at the access rights are updated to reflect the decision to grant access to the requested location information and at it is determined whether the requested location information is going to be fuzzed. In contrast if at it is determined that the third party did not grant access to the requested location information at the access rights are updated to reflect the decision to not grant access to the requested location information and at the location API denies the requesting application access to the requested location information. In embodiments the decision by the third party to grant or not grant access to the requested location information may include further information indicating that the current decision to grant or not grant access to the requested location information is applicable for the current request a current session and or for a defined period of time e.g. a day the next ten days five minutes or any other user specified period of time .
