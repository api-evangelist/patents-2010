The development of sensors and autonomous platforms for mobile microsystems capable of accessing restricted locations is driving the need for scaled efficient power generation conversion and management systems. Such systems are projected to be palm sized and smaller with mobility and functionality limited by size and weight constraints particularly as they relate to the power system. Without effective power solutions both stationary and mobile microsystems will have minimal utility.

Effective power solutions are needed for various meso scale and micro scale autonomous systems being developed such as small scale autonomous robots. For example Meso to Mm scale locomotion requirements for small scale autonomous robots and aircraft vary markedly depending on the system size and mobility choice walking vs. flying . Anticipated requirements for mesoscale and mm scale robots and aircraft vary. A basic system in a palm size robotic scale that can achieve multiple minutes of continuous flying time and tens of meters range using a standard Li polymer battery can be purchased commercially for roughly 20. Retrofitting this device with a few grams of sensors and a crude mobile sensor platform is plausible and this is one example that commercially available power sources are sufficient to create flight at this mesoscale. However there is a need to drastically improve nearly all aspects of such a device including mobility stability flying time robustness intelligence etc. Effective power solutions are needed since the implementation of commercially available converters for a mm3 mg scale autonomous system would cripple the mobility of such scaled platforms. There is an effort to develop cubic millimeter milligram scale power conversion and management systems capable of boosting 10 100 mW of power from 100V with 80 efficiency. The limiting factor for miniaturization of typical power converters is the size weight of the passive components inductors and capacitors . Under development are new CMOS converter topologies operating at higher frequencies than traditional converters 100 500 MHz vs 0.1 10 MHz which reduces required inductor and capacitor values and creates the need for magnetic core materials and fabrication techniques for efficient high frequency magnetic components. Techniques developed from microelectromechanical systems MEMS are contemplated to microfabricate ultra miniature passive components.

Since most designers plan to use a single battery as the power source power converters capable of boosting or bucking 2 3 orders of magnitude in voltage and or power will likely be required in an ultra miniature form factor. For example a 60 mg flying robot like that disclosed in R. J. Wood Fly Robot Fly IEEE Spectrum March 2008 hereby incorporated by reference requires 200 Vac to drive its piezo actuators from a 3 4V thin film battery while simultaneously providing 5 10 Vdc to a sensor or two and 

The increasing popularity of miniaturized sensors actuators filters and switched power converters creates a growing need for micro scale integrated magnetic devices which have low resistance high values of inductance and high saturation current. Integrated micro scale devices of this nature may be useful in replacing surface mounted devices and facilitate miniaturizing dc dc converters for power supplies in communications military aerospace applications portable computers portable peripherals and various other devices. Integrated microinductors and microtransformers can be used in high frequency operations resulting in high efficiency quality low cost and low power loss. Discussion of the advantages of high switching frequencies and the replacement of miniaturized surface mount magnetic components with fully integrated micro magnetic devices is reported in Jae Y. Park and Jong U. Bu Packaging Compatible Microtransformers on a Silicon Substrate IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging Vol. 26 No. 2 pages 160 164 May 2003.

Compact power conversion units for mobile microsystems has been a subject of interest as disclosed in B. Morgan et al. Micro power Requirements Conversion for Autonomous Microsystems NATO Specialist Meeting on Energy Technologies and Energy Management for Portable Power Systems for Military Applications Slovenia May 2009 hereby incorporated by reference. The switched mode power supply units require miniaturized high frequency 10 MHz high Q inductors and capacitors. This requires multiple materials for passives on a single chip i.e. magnetics for inductors and high k dielectrics for capacitors. Inductor cores for high frequency switched mode power supplies have been fabricated by depositing the magnetic materials in various ways. The challenge in integrating inductors for high frequency power conversion remains in the integration of magnetic materials that are compatible with micro fabrication techniques.

Conventional manufacturing systems have also attempted to integrate magnetic materials through magnetic deposition methods for inductor cores including electroplating a magnetic core pulsed magnetic sputter deposition and embedding nanoparticles into an SU 8 polymer as disclosed in S. C. O. Mathuna et al. Magnetics on Silicon An Enabling Technology for Power Supply on Chip IEEE Trans. on Power Elect. vol. 20 pp. 585 592 May 2005 hereinafter Mathuna article . SU 8 is a commonly used epoxy based viscous polymer negative photoresist that can be spun or spread over a thickness ranging from 0.1 micrometer up to 2 millimeters and processed with standard contact lithography. Silicon integration has proven to be a main route to achieving low cost and space efficiencies with the integration of control functions and smart power onto silicon allowing dramatic reductions in component count and therefore power supply circuit footprint and cost while at the same time delivering enhancements in manufacturability and reliability. Electroplated Ni Fe based alloys have been disclosed in connection with inductors as discussed in J. Y. Park and J. U. Bu Packaging compatible microtransformers on a silicon substrate IEEE Trans. Adv. Packaging vol. 26 pp. 160 164 May 2003 hereinafter Park article and D. P. Arnold et al. Vertically laminated magnetic cores by electroplating Ni Fe into micromachined Si IEEE Trans. Magn vol 26 pp. 3060 3062 July 2004 hereinafter Arnold article however the high conductance of the alloys necessitate laminations to mitigate high frequency eddy current losses. Sputter deposited laminations of permalloy were also demonstrated in a 10 MHz transformer as reported in C. R. Sullivan S. R. Saunders Microfabrication process for high frequency power conversion transformers IEEE Power Electron. Spec. Conf. vol 2 pp. 658 664 June 1995 however laminations required for implementations at higher frequencies may become fabrication and time intensive. A ferrite composite core of SU 8 filled with MnZn ferrite powder has also been demonstrated in an inductor core reportedly providing a three fold improvement in inductance density as reported in P. Galle et al. Ultra compact Power Conversion Based on a CMOS compatible Microfabricated Power Inductor with Minimized Core Losses Dig. IEEE Electron. Compon. Techn. Conf. pp. 1889 1894 2007 however the magnetic nanoparticle packing density using this technique is believed to be somewhat limited.

Switched mode power supply units require miniaturized high frequency 10 MHz high Q inductors and capacitors. This requires multiple materials for passives on a single chip i.e. magnetics for inductors and high k dielectrics for capacitors. The challenge in integrating inductors for high frequency power conversion remains in the integration of magnetic materials which are compatible with micro fabrication techniques.

In conventional fabrication a wafer which may be silicon undergoes many microfabrication process steps such as doping or ion implantation etching deposition of various materials and photolithographic patterning. Conventional manufacturing systems have made previous efforts to make integrated passive devices either directly in a silicon wafer or through a system in a package approach e.g. integrated passive devices have been flip chip bonded to silicon wafers with active components. As used herein the terminology flip chip also known as Controlled Collapse Chip Connection or its acronym C4 is a method for interconnecting semiconductor devices such as integrated circuit chips and Microelectromechanical systems to external circuitry with solder bumps that have been deposited onto the top side of the wafer. Flip chip bonding while somewhat less efficient than direct integration to the remaining CMOS circuitry allows for 1 reliable thick film deposition of a known material system Fe Co 2 an integration strategy for small size thick film devices with an insulator 3 advanced materials insertion and 4 multilayer Fe Co insulator devices.

Prior attempts to build integrated passive devices integration of passive and active components were generally achieved through printed circuit board level integration. Due to integrated passive devices inherently being the larger components of an integrated system however integration of passive devices into a system has generally been difficult to achieve by conventional manufacturing systems. For example integration has generally been difficult in conventional systems because different passive devices typically require fabrication variety of materials and technologies that may not be compatible with the active components.

Desirable characteristics of magnetic cores for the integrated power microinductors and microtransformers can be summarized as follows first high saturation flux density in order to obtain high saturation current second high relative permeability to obtain high inductance third high electrical resistivity to reduce eddy current losses at high frequency operation. In addition integrated micro scaled magnetic devices should be designed to have a completely closed magnetic circuit to minimize leakage flux since leakage flux does not contribute to the total inductance of the devices and can cause interference with other integrated electronic circuitry on the same substrate.

Accordingly there exists a need for a low cost material delivery method as an alternative to inter aila the traditional micro fabrication of magnetic cores described above.

An embodiment of the present invention comprises inter alia the delivery of materials such as magnetic materials through a liquid suspension deposition into m sized structures that form for example an inductor element. The delivery structure consists of a well and capillary where the well is the target for liquid deposition. The capillary where the particles which may be on the order of nanoparticles in suspension are deposited may serve for example as an inductor core. For example wicking of polymer solutions which are relevant to sensor applications may be conducted for example into 120 m 2 m 4 m volumes where the solutions include for example magnetic nanoparticle suspensions and the deposition method may be used for dimensions relevant to for example inductor core geometries 1 100 MHz range . This technique enables multiple material deposition onto a single surface using a single low cost deposition technique.

An example design where the current method could be implemented to deliver materials for an inductor core is shown in . This shows an inductor where a center conductive line is suspended in the capillary used for material delivery. The cross section shows an envisioned illustration of the magnetic material surrounding the center conductive layer after suspension delivery and solvent evaporation in the capillary.

The embodiments herein provide an apparatus and method of fabricating multiple integrated passive devices types using a single non contact fabrication step on a single chip. In addition the passive devices may be customized to a specified performance depending on the application. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

For example integrated passive device may include electroplated copper e.g. 18 m thick on an insulating substrate e.g. a Pyrex substrate available from Corning Inc. New York USA . A variety of capillary channel A F lengths and widths may be fabricated using this structure. In addition a suspension of BaTiOnano particles may be mixed in methanol then deposited by hand using a syringe e.g. 10 L syringe into target well . Each target well may occupy an area of approximately 5 mm 5 mm where such a large scale may be used to facilitate drops deposited by hand. In addition a more sophisticated deposition technique such as ink jet printing may be used to allow for smaller areas of target well . Therefore the size of target well may be a consideration that takes into account the size and accuracy of the dispensing method described below . In addition the thickness of a nano particle film when capillary channel may be 45 m wide may be approximately 4 m. The capillary channel may optionally have an end wall as illustrated in .

The solution delivery platform comprised of a microcapillary connected to a microwell enables picogram solute deposition on structures. Precision material placement in the capillary from a 100 pl drop inkjetted into the well is achieved without the destruction of the microstructure and adjacent submicron electrostatic gaps. This method scales to smaller structures without the need for drop miniaturization. In theory the solute transfer in the system may be conceptualized in terms of a drying process involving three regions. The accumulation region builds solute concentration in the capillary. The solidification region initiates the solidification of solute starting at the free end of the capillary. The termination region is characterized by a rapid increase in the solidification due to an increase in the well concentration near the end of the drop lifetime. The accumulation time and solidification rate depend on concentration. illustrates the progression of the solidification process in the capillary channel the free end being pictured to the right.

Maskless fabrication techniques have several advantages over conventional photolithographic techniques for fabrication on the micro and nanoscales. These advantages include rapid prototypes where the need for a new mask for each design iteration is eliminated. Direct deposition is an additive process and therefore costly materials can be conserved. Elevated processing temperatures causing substrate distortion due to temperature coefficients of expansion mismatch can be eliminated with maskless deposition. Deposition onto suspended structures with micron and submicron scale dimensions may only be realized with maskless techniques since photoresist deposition would lead to the destruction of the device. This is particularly beneficial in areas such as the implementation of chemical sensor arrays which require multimaterial deposition onto single chip surfaces and which would require multiple mask steps whereas maskless techniques such as ink jet printing and microcapillary deposition are less costly.

Direct material deposition and manipulation on these scales have been previously achieved through techniques such as atomic force microscopy AFM dip pen lithography and inkjet printing. Although AFM and dip pen lithography techniques provide precise deposition on the nanoscale both require high precision three dimensional control of the fabrication unit and may be considered slow processes Inkjet printing technology is a more rapid deposition technique. However direct inkjet printing results in lower resolution features where the state of the art spot size is a few microns in diameter. Nonuniform structures may result from coffee ring formation and low viscosity fluids and inks are necessary for repeatable deposition. Direct inkjet deposition necessitates large dimensions leading to in the case of mass sensitive concentration sensors poor mass concentration resolution detectors. The deposition method of the present invention provides uniform deposition confined to only the microstructure. Miniaturizing the inkjet drop size which proves more difficult for repeatable deposition due to issues such as jet clogging is not necessary for micron and nanoscale material placement using the method of the preferred embodiment. Depositing the drops into a well and having the solution wick into an adjacent suspended capillary alleviates some of the major problems with inkjetting and allows for picogram dosing precise material placement with microscale resolution and uniform deposition which is not plagued by the coffee ring phenomenon. Alignment of the deposition tool is set by the more relaxed requirement to hit the well. If the inkjet drop placement is misaligned by tens of microns there is not a direct translation of misalignment to the deposited material as is the case for other maskless deposition techniques such as dip pen and fountain pen nanolithographies. Although the well is pictured in as somewhat funnel shaped the well may take a variety of forms depending on space availability as well as other constraints. Moreover although illustrated in without supporting structure the capillary may be designed along the length of the structure to be dosed with material having micron scaled grooves and or slots which may be dosed with precise material amounts such as for example a 100 pg per drop resolution. The method of dispensing the liquid may comprise at least one of using a syringe ink jet printing zone casting and dip pen nano lithography.

Once solution is deposited in step step delivers the nano particles in solution or suspension e.g. as described in step to a channel e.g. capillary channel shown in where the channel comprises a passive structure e.g. passive structure . In step the nano particles in the solution or suspension e.g. as described in step are wicked and dispersed throughout the channel e.g. capillary channel as shown in and throughout the passive structure e.g. passive structure . Such a wicking may occur through a physical phenomenon similar to the coffee ring formation phenomenon see e.g. Bedair et al. Controlled picogram material placement on suspended structures using solution wicking Solid State Sensor Actuator and Microsystems Workshop Hilton Head S.C. June 2008 the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference . Through the coffee ring formation phenomenon almost 100 of the nano particles in either solution or suspension e.g. as described in step are dispersed throughout the capillary e.g. capillary channel shown in .

In a preferred embodiment the width of the capillary is the same or smaller than the diameter of the meniscus of the liquid. As seen in the capillary has a beginning A where the liquid first enters the capillary and an end B. The capillary action is driven or affected by forces resulting from the surface tension of the liquid and interaction between the molecules of the capillary walls and the liquid. The capillary action has a pumping effect which drives the particles to the end of the capillary and the solidification occurs first at the end of the capillary B and proceeds incrementally towards the beginning of the capillary A such that the capillary action or capillary forces produce a pumping effect which produces a uniform distribution of particles at the end of the capillary and as the agglomerate forms produces a uniform distribution of particles within the agglomerate. illustrate the solidification process.

The method shown in yields structures e.g. integrated passive device with aspect ratios equivalent to that of the capillary channel e.g. capillary channel where the nano particles are dispersed in step . Capillary channel shown in can be designed in a variety of passives configurations which is further described below.

Moreover the multi material single platform device may be manufactured according to the method shown in . For example each passive device shown in may be dosed with different material types e.g. according to steps shown in allowing for a plurality of customized passive devices A F on multi material single platform device which may be for example a single integrated circuit. The exemplary passive devices e.g. a decoupling capacitor F a power transformer B with a high permeability magnetic core a low current and or a high current power inductor D E a high frequency RF inductor C and or a high frequency filter capacitor A may include both a target well e.g. target well and capillary e.g. capillary channel construct similar to integrated passive device illustrated in . Each target well may occupy an area of approximately 5 mm 5 mm where such a large scale may be used to facilitate drops deposited by hand. The solution delivery platform comprised of microcapillaries A F connected to microwells A F enables solute or nanoparticle deposition into structures with picogram resolution. The capillaries A F may be designed along the length of the structure as shown in forming micron scaled grooves and or slots which may be dosed with precise material amounts of material such as for example a 100 pg per drop resolution. The liquid may be a solution comprised of a solution and or suspension comprising particles such as for example nano particles and wherein the nano particles are mixed with any of polymers and additional nano particles comprising varying chemical composition. As an example the delivery methodology may comprise the dosing of capillaries with polymers including NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in suspension for dosing capillaries constituting inductor type passives e.g. D E with volumes as large as 2 mm 15 m 10 m where the length of the capillary may cover dimensions as small as microns and as large as millimeters. In addition the nano particles may comprise high k dielectric nano particles e.g. F within the structure of decoupling capacitor F . Moreover the nano particles may comprise magnetic nano particles. Furthermore the liquid dispensing method may comprise at least one of using a syringe ink jet printing zone casting and dip pen nano lithography. Such maskless fabrication techniques have several advantages over conventional photolithographic techniques for fabrication on the micro and nanoscales including rapid prototypes conservation of costly materials and elimination of masks elimination of elevated processing temperatures which cause substrate distortion due to temperature coefficients of expansion mismatch. As mentioned above deposition onto suspended structures with micron and submicron scale dimensions is realized without photoresist deposition which leads to the destruction of the certain devices. These advantages are particularly beneficial in areas such as the implementation of device arrays where each device requires a material which varies from that required from another device in the same array.

As previously mentioned capillary channel shown in may be designed to include any integrated passive device of interest. with reference to are non limiting examples illustrating different possible integrated passive device structures. is a schematic diagram of integrated passive device according to an embodiment herein. Integrated passive device shown in includes target well capillary channel and passive structure . illustrate integrated passive device along cross sections A A and illustrates capillary wall where illustrates cross section A A and illustrates cross section A A with wicked nano particles e.g. dielectric nano particles . is a schematic diagram of integrated passive device according to an embodiment herein. Integrated passive device shown in includes target well and passive structure where passive structure includes capillary channel . In addition illustrates integrated passive devices . is a cross sectional view taken along cross sections B B of and illustrates capillary wall and capillary channels and . illustrates the same cross section B B with wicked nano particles e.g. dielectric nano particles . are schematic diagrams of integrated passive device A according to an embodiment herein. As shown integrated passive device A is an alternative embodiment to integrated passive device shown in . includes 4 embedded conductor structures which may be copper traces or the like. As known to those skilled in the art additional alternative embodiments are possible though not shown to the embodiments shown in .

In passive devices A and A may include capillary channels or filled with high k dielectric nano particles after solvent drying. The amount of material filling or percentage of the cross sectional area of the channel with nano particles depends on the liquid solid contact angle as well as aspect ratio of the capillary e.g. capillary channel or . In addition integrated passive devices A and A shown in includes multiple capillary channels e.g. capillary channel and capillary channel which yields a higher capacitance per unit area than a single channel design e.g. integrated passive device shown in . show structure cross sections where stacked conductive lines can be configured to achieve higher capacitance densities.

A further example of an inductor transformer construction according to the principles of the present invention is depicted in which illustrates a perspective view of a toroid inductor embodiment. It is known that toroidal coils are used in high frequency coils and transformers and can have higher Q factors and higher inductance than similarly constructed solenoid coils due largely to the diminished turns required around the closed magnetic path provided by the core. Since the magnetic flux is largely confined to the core of the toroid energy is less apt to be absorbed by nearby objects. For torus shaped magnetic fields the poloidal flux direction threads the hole in the center of the torus while the toroidal flux direction is parallel the core of the torus. Optionally in accordance with the principles of the present invention as shown in by placing a magnet underneath the wafer or substrate during the material delivery of magnetic nano particles the permeability may be increased. Using a magnet during the material delivery effects the alignment of the field as depicted schematically in which methodology also may be incorporated in the embodiments of as well as and in cases where involving the delivery of magnetic nanoparticles. Liquid suspensions dropped in magnetic fields ensure that the easy axis of the material is oriented in the preferred direction of flux lines. As used herein the easy axis refers to the energetically favorable direction of the spontaneous magnetization in a ferromagnetic material.

In addition a spiral channel design similar to that shown in may be implemented as a stacked inductor capacitor or transformer configuration. For example illustrate stacked multi layer spiral according to an embodiment herein. Stacked spiral includes target well the entrance to which is indicated by an arrow capillary channel and a plurality of nodes . Passive device includes capillary walls which form a conductor insulator conductor stack. Depending on the configuration and type of nano particles wicked e.g. according to the method shown in and connections between nodes any of a transformer e.g. a stack inductor e.g. and a capacitor e.g. maybe be implemented. For example if magnetic nano particles are deposited in target well e.g. as described in steps and shown in then a transformer or an inductor may be implemented. Moreover a capacitor may be achieved with stacked spiral when high k dielectric nano particles are deposited in the target well e.g. as described in steps and shown in .

As described above the delivery method consists of a well and a capillary as illustrated in . Once liquid is deposited in the target well capillary forces drive the suspension into the capillary. After the capillary is loaded with suspension the evaporation of the liquid off of the top surface of the capillary is replenished by the same volume of liquid from the well. This results in a liquid velocity profile v x t where x is the distance from the well and t is time. A constant supply of suspension from the well results in a rapid growth of the nanoparticle concentration at the end of the capillary. The concentration reaches a point where the suspension liquid phase transitions to a solid phase. This results in a solidified material that grows from the end of the channel back towards the well entrance x 0 in . The theory describing this physical phenomenon is summarized below however a more detailed derivation of the evaporation driven deposition of polymer in solution is described in S. S. Bedair et al. Picogram Material Dosing of Microstructures J. App. Physics 2009 hereby incorporated by reference.

The boundary conditions of zero velocity and zero flux of nanoparticles at the end of the channel L are

Well and capillary structures may be fabricated by electroplating copper 15 m thick into a photoresist mold on a pyrex substrate . For example the capillary length and width may be 2 mm and 10 m respectively. In previous work a 10 mg mL methanol suspension of spherically shaped 30 nm diameter 30 nm NiFeOnanoparticles purchased from MTI Corporation was prepared and followed by 2 L deposition of suspension into the well by hand using a 10 L syringe. shows images captured by video at different times during the drying process where the t 0 image represents a capillary filled with suspension with an initial concentration of c 10 mg mL. The arrows in the images of indicate the solidification front L which is the transition between liquid suspension and the solidified nanoparticles. The solidification front normalized to channel length L is monitored through custom software developed in Matlab as shown in . In the growth of the front is compared to the model solved by FEA.

The drying process may be described inter alia by two regions accumulation and solidification. Accumulation is the time required after the liquid fills the capillary for the concentration at the capillary end to increase until the suspension at that end first becomes solidified. A 1.3 sec accumulation time was measured and compares well to the model 1.7 sec . A measured solidification rate of 44.2 m sec also compares well 51 m sec .

Another well and capillary structure was dosed in the same manner with 2 L of suspension but in this case a cylindrical FeNdB magnet 3.16 mm diameter and 1.60 mm thickness was placed underneath the 500 m thick pyrex wafer for field assisted alignment of the magnetic nanoparticles during the drying process as schematically illustrated in the inset in . The magnet was manually aligned so that the center of the magnet was spaced 2 mm from the channel end in the x direction and 1.3 mm below the channel end in the z direction. The magnet was kept there during suspension delivery to the well and drying of the solvent as schematically depicted in the inset illustration of . The static magnetic x directed field H versus the z directed field H can be approximated based on the geometry and position of the magnet relative to the channel. For a more indepth study of the subject see D. K. Cheng Field and Wave Electromagnetics 2nd ed. Reading Mass. Addison Wesley 1989 pp. 243 266 hereby incorporated by reference. The relative magnitudes of the fields H H range between 9 at the channel end and 1 at the channel well interface. Interferometry measurements show an approximate 5.4 10cmvolume of NiFeOin the channel dosed while in the presence of the magnet. A 5 increase in delivered material volume is attributed to the liquid delivery technique where the dispensed liquid volume is manually determined through the hand held microsyringe. A more sophisticated dropping technique such as ink jet printing would mitigate the variation in liquid volume.

Both channels one dosed with and one dosed without the presence of a magnetic field were sectioned from the wafer using a dicing saw. Magnetization measurements by an Alternating Gradient Magnetometer for each channel were taken both in the direction along the channel length x axis and in a direction perpendicular to the channel length z axis . The magnetization curves of both channels are shown in with orientations illustrated in the inset. As depicted in well and capillary structures were dosed with the magnetic nanoparticles suspension with and without the presence of a permanent magnetic field during the filling of the capillary . Magnetization measurements show a difference in relative permeabilities of approximately 4.2 and 3.3 with and without the presence of the magnetic field respectively. The alignment of the field during the magnetization measurements are indicated in . The M H curves are scaled by both the measured volumes of the wicked nanoparticles and the powder bulk density 0.89 g cm provided by the manufacturer then normalized to the saturation magnetization M 37.7 emu g also provided by the manufacturer. Assuming a particle mass density of 5.37 g cm a volumetric packing density of 0.18 and 0.13 was extracted for the x aligned and z aligned measurements respectively. For the channel dosed in the presence of a magnetic field a volumetric packing density of 0.24 and 0.17 respectively was extracted. These volumetric packing densities compare well with the bulk powder packing densities of 0.17 as provided by the nanoparticle manufacturer. For the channel with nanoparticles delivered without the presence of the magnetic field a slight anisotropy was observed along the channel length. There is a tendency for the magnetic nanoparticles to align such that the permeability along the channel length x direction is larger than the permeability observed in the direction orthogonal to the channel length z direction . Relative permeabilities of 3.3 and 2.3 for the x directed and z directed magnetization test fields respectively were extracted from the measurements. Improvements in the extracted permeabilities were measured for the channel dosed in the presence of a magnetic field. For the x directed measurements a of 4.2 was measured while 3.3 was extracted for the z directed measurements. The alignment of the magnetic dipoles were observed to improve because of the externally applied magnetic field during the fabrication.

A preferred embodiment incorporates a materials deposition technology developed in conjunction with a multilayer thick film metallization process to enable the integration of nickel ferrite NiFeO nanoparticles into micromachined inductors in a single fabrication step. Assembly of materials could be used to fill straight single ended capillaries with polymers as described in the publication S S. Bedair and G. K. Fedder Picogram Material Dosing of Microstructures vol. 106 2006 hereby incorporated by reference and magnetic nanoparticles as described in S. S. Bedair et al. Magnetic Nanoparticle Dosing of MEMS Structures by Evaporation in Capillaries IEEE TMAG via a well capillary solution delivery system. The principles of the present invention include the application of this technology to fabricate closed soft magnetic cores around transmission line inductors for applications such as power systems on a chip. Significant advancements to the technology include 1 the deposition of materials to fully encapsulate structures 2 within complex three dimensional molds with 3 a scaling up of the fill volume by an order of magnitude over previous works for 4 integrating magnetic materials into inductor cores for up to 44 improvement in inductance. It is important to note that the generality of the method could further allow the filling of arbitrarily complex structures with any choice of nanoparticulate materials for various applications in sensing and actuation.

A preferred method includes enhanced solvent evaporation out of the small dimensions of a capillary resulting in wicking of material from an attached well containing a suspension of nanoparticles. Solidification of the particles occurs in the capillary from the channel end towards the well as illustrated in as the solvent evaporates. See for example S S. Bedair and G. K. Fedder Picogram Material Dosing of Microstructures vol. 106 2006 hereby incorporated by reference. This work leverages the flexibility of a multilayer electroplated copper metallization process to shape the attached capillary such that the deposited material fully encapsulates a copper trace forming a closed magnetic core inductor.

The fabricated ring shaped transmission line inductor structure consists as shown in of three concentric copper traces. The inner and the outer traces function structurally to form the capillary walls which could be for example copper approximately 40 m tall while the middle functions electrically as the inductive element. The electrically inductive element may be suspended Cu 30 m wide and 10 m thick propped up 10 m above the surface of the wafer by periodic intermittent support posts S as illustrated in the cross sections of .

A solution of isopropyl alcohol n butanol diacetone alcohol and Butvar B 79 poly vinyl butyral was mixed with 30 nm NiFeOnanoparticles. This suspension was dropped by handheld syringe into the wells where capillary forces wicked the solution into the channels. is an illustration of the solidification in the capillary beginning with the accumulation of nanoparticles in the region of the ring farthest from the well. When the concentration of particles at that far position reached a critical density formation of the solid began. Solidification fronts marked the transition from liquid to solid and these fronts progressed symmetrically along the two capillary branches leading towards the well.

SEM images of the structure before and after material deposition showed that the magnetic material was well confined within the channel and had been filled up to the top of the structure. Deposition of the particles was found to occur fully around the inductor line as evidenced by the view in through the backside of the clear Pyrex wafer. The measured plots in showed that deposition of the magnetic core yielded a 44 improvement in inductance from the air core case of 1.25 nH to 1.80 nH with only slight roll off past 300 MHz and with no detriment to the quality factor up to 225 MHz. Such inductance improvement is similar to other results of non annealed screen printed ferrites which require more fabrication steps than the current technique for full encapsulation of the inductor. The flexibility of this process also allows for CMOS compatible co integration of high dielectric capacitors to realize power systems on a chip.

In a power converter the role of a switched inductor is to store energy magnetically in its core and then deliver this energy electrically to a load. The quality factor of an inductor a measure of how well it stores versus dissipates energy given by Q L R indicates that optimum efficiency can be achieved by increasing the operating frequency and inductance L while decreasing resistance R. The resistive term includes the electrical resistance of the conductor and magnetic core losses.

Typically high permeability cores have been implemented to drastically increase inductance. However some problems in producing microfabricated cored inductors have included high processing temperature core losses that increase rapidly with frequency and permeabilities that degrade at higher frequencies. In high frequency applications air core inductors may have an advantage in terms of cost fabrication simplicity weight and power loss over traditional high permeability core inductors.

To temporarily store and redeliver energy in a scaled inductor volume high power densities and low material losses are needed. The ideal inductor magnetic material would exhibit high relative permeability r and high saturation magnetization Bsat to enable the most energy storage and likewise low coercivity Hc low electrical conductivity and zero magnetostriction SM to minimize losses as shown in . Additionally the material should possess a high thermal conductivity to help dissipate any heat and thermal expansion coefficient close to silicon to mitigate thermally induced stresses. Unfortunately the materials with the highest Bsat and r metal alloy based ferromagnetics have high electrical conductivities and thus suffer from large eddy current losses at high frequencies. Oxide materials on the other hand which are highly electrically resistive have only moderate Bsat and r values and low thermal conductivity.

At higher frequencies the dominant source of power loss in an inductor is from eddy currents within the ferromagnetic structure. While laminate structures where oxide layers are interposed between the electrodes and the ferromagnetic layer have succeeded in minimizing the eddy currents and resistive losses in the z direction substantial in plane losses due to the eddy currents persist. Thus existing materials are insufficient for high frequency applications. In addition there are a number of obstacles that must be overcome to achieve a fully integrated device. While iron based metals are well understood in order to achieve a realizable device a number of layers of iron based metal must be integrated with electrode materials and an insulator to minimize the eddy currents. All of these material deposition steps need to be accomplished eventually in a manner that is CMOS compatible. The most challenging restriction of which is the upper temperature limit of 400 C. as ferromagnetic materials frequently require post deposition annealing to maximize properties.

A generic magnetic material deposition method has been shown for inductor cores. This deposition technology may be extended to other applications where dosing of MEMS structures with magnetic materials is needed such as magnetic sensor applications or vibration harvesting. It is important to note that this method can deliver a wide variety of magnetic materials in addition to other materials in an inexpensive manner onto a single surface. This enables a rapid low cost multi material deposition technique as an alternate to traditional micro fabrication techniques.
