The technology generally relates to the production of particles that can be used for the production of cathodes for lithium ion batteries.

Lithium ion batteries have enjoyed commercial success over the last 20 years as the dominant technology for energy storage in consumer electronics. In recent years an increase in global energy demand rising and fluctuating crude oil prices and environmental concerns have led to an increase in demand for lithium ion batteries. In particular lithium ion battery technology is being developed for applications in hybrid and electric vehicles. For vehicle applications the materials that comprise the cathode materials in lithium ion batteries must provide high capacity high power improved safety long calendar lifetimes thermal stability low cost and low toxicity. Generally cathode materials for lithium ion batteries that are currently on the market are unable to meet all the requirements for vehicular applications.

The energy storage component of a lithium ion battery cathode includes solid micrometer sized particles. These particles are typically of the composition LiMO where M refers to a variety of transition metals both in isolation or in combination commonly nickel Ni cobalt Co or manganese Mn . LiCoOis the most common commercial cathode material. However the toxicity and high cost of Co has encouraged the development of other cathode materials with Ni or Mn.

In some embodiments the rate sufficient to provide the gradient is from 0.001 L hr to 50 L hr.

Illustrative alcohols may include but are not limited to methanol ethanol propanol butanol etc. In some embodiments the precipitating step is carried out a temperature between 20 C. to 100 C. or between 25 C. to 80 C. In some embodiments the process includes collecting the particles.

In some embodiments the process includes contacting the particles with lithium. For example the lithium may be in the form of lithium metal or as lithium carbonate lithium nitrate or lithium hydroxide. In some embodiments the ratio of lithium to transition metal ranges from 0.5 1 to 1.5 1. In some embodiments the process includes heating the particles at elevated temperature. In some embodiments the particles are heated an elevated temperature between 100 C. to 1500 C. or between 300 C. to 1000 C. In some embodiments the transition metal oxide core is Ni rich and an outer most transition metal oxide layer is manganese rich. In some embodiments an electrochemical device is provided which includes a particle prepared by this process.

In another aspect a transition metal oxide particle or a lithium transition metal oxide particle is provided with a radius of the particle defined by a core and two or more layers where the particle has a gradient concentration along at least a portion of the radius and the core is concentrated in a first transition metal and each successive layer has a lesser concentration of the first transition metal as the distance from the core increases.

In another aspect a method to control the composition of a particle is provided including contacting a first transition metal compound with a second transition metal compound to form a transition metal source solution adding the transition metal source solution into a chamber at a specific flow rate contacting the transition metal source solution with a precipitating agent to form a precursor solution precipitating from the precursor solution particles with a radius the particles including a transition metal oxide core and at least two layers of transition metal oxide where the particle has a gradient concentration of the first transition metal in comparison to the second transition metal is inversely related to the radius of the particle over at least a portion of the radius where the rate of change of the concentration of the second transition metal in the particle is in accordance with the equation I 

In another aspect a transition metal oxide material is provided which includes one or more particles each having a core and outer layers where the composition of a first component as compared to a second component in a layer of the particle increases with the distance of the layer from the core. In some embodiments the composition of the second component as compared to a second component in a layer of the particle decreases with the distance of the layer from the core.

A process is provided for preparing transition metal particles with a gradient in composition from the core of the particle to the outer layers. In particular the process includes contacting a first transition metal compound with a second transition metal compound to form a transition metal source solution under specific process conditions. Particles with a desired composition gradient are precipitated from the transition metal source solution. The transition metal particles may be subsequently treated to produce metal oxide materials. In particular the transition metal particles may be thermally treated with lithium to form lithiated metal oxide materials. The metal oxides may be used in the cathodes of lithium ion batteries. The particles may be also combined with other metals such as but not limited to lithium to form cathode active metal oxides. The metal oxides may be used in the preparation of electrodes for use in a wide variety of applications including but not limited to electrochemical cells batteries and super capacitors.

In cathodes for lithium ion batteries materials that have high Ni content have high capacities. However materials with high Ni content suffer from poor cycle life and high interfacial cell impedance due to oxygen release and high concentrations of unstable Ni ions. The Ni rich materials are unable to meet the safety and calendar life requirements for lithium ion batteries in automotive applications. Particles that are high in Mn even when in combination with Ni are more stable. In contrast materials with high Mn content provide excellent cycle life and safety because they are much more stable when in contact with the battery electrolyte compared to Ni cathodes. Therefore a particle that has a high Ni content in the interior portion for high capacity and has a high concentration of Mn at the outer layers for improved safety and stability may be suited for lithium ion battery cathodes.

As used herein the gradient in composition of a particle is a change in concentration of a particular component of the particle as a function of the distance of radius of the particle. For example this may refer to a change in concentration of a particular metal component as the size of the particle changes. The core of a particle may have a relatively high concentration of a particular metal however as the particle grows the relative concentration becomes lower. Thus a gradient in concentration of that particular metal is established over at least a portion of the radius. By at least a portion it is meant that the concentration gradient may exist in the inner portions of the particle however as the particle grows the concentration may be constant toward the outer reaches of the radius of the particle. In some embodiments transition metal solutions are contacted by stirring.

In some embodiments the first transition metal compound is a solution rich in manganese Mn rich solution and the second metal compound is a solution rich in nickel Ni rich solution . A solution rich in a particular component such as Mn or Ni has a significant molar concentration of that component greater than 50 mol of the transition metals present not the total concentration.

The first and second transition metal compounds may include manganese Mn cobalt Co or nickel Ni . The transition metal solutions are dissolved in water in isolation or in combination in concentration ranges of 0.001 to 6 M but typically in the range of 1 to 2 M. The transition metal compound may include metal sulfates nitrates halides acetates or citrates. For example the transition metal compound may include manganese sulfate nickel sulfate cobalt sulfate manganese nitrate nickel nitrate and cobalt nitrate or any of these metals as metal chlorides acetates or citrates.

In some embodiments a precipitation agent is added to the transition metal source to form a precursor solution and particles are precipitated in a continuously stirred tank reactor reactor . The precipitation agent may be chosen from but is not limited to sodium carbonate sodium hydroxide potassium carbonate potassium hydroxide lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide. Additionally a chelating agent may be fed to the reactor which includes but is not limited to ammonium hydroxide hydrazine or EDTA. The precipitation agent and the chelating agent may dissolved in water and fed into the reactor at concentrations between 0.001 and 6 M or between 1 to 2 M for the precipitation agent and 0.001 to 2 M for the chelating agent. The temperature in the reactor should be sufficient for the precipitating agent and chelating agent to react sufficiently with the transition metal source solution. For example the reactor temperature may range from 10 to 150 C. from 20 C. and 120 C. from 25 C. and 100 C. or from 25 to 80 C. The pH should be maintained may be set between 0 to 14 depending on the desired conditions for particle growth. Typically the stirring speed in the reactor should be sufficient for the reaction and may vary between 0 to 5000 rotations per minute. The flow rates of solutions that are fed to the reactor are should be controlled for desired particle nucleation. The flow rates may be set between 0.001 to 50 liters per hour L hr .

In some embodiments the particles are further processed to form transition metal oxides or lithiated transition metal oxides. The product from the reactor is solid particles dispersed in solution. The particle diameters may vary from 0.01 to 100 m in size. In some embodiments the particles have a diameter from 1 m to 30 m. Generally the transition metal particles are roughly spherical but may have other shapes such as cylindrical ellipses etc.

In some embodiments the particles are washed with water after precipitation to remove residual impurities dried and fired in a furnace. In some embodiments the particles are combined with an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal during the firing. For example the metal may be lithium sodium potassium calcium or magnesium. In some embodiments the metal is lithium. The furnace temperature is sufficient to cause insertion of the metal into the particle. For example the temperature may range from 100 C. to 1500 C. from 300 C. to 1000 C. or from 350 C. to 750 C. according to various embodiments.

In one aspect process conditions may be used to control the gradient in composition of the particles that are produced in the reactor. In some embodiments the concentration of a species in the transition metal source solution that is added to the reactor correlates with the relative composition of that species in the resulting precipitating particle. In addition changing the flow rate of the first transition metal solution into the second transition metal solution will impact the composition of the particles.

A molar balance around the second container can be used to determine the concentration of any species in the transition metal source solution entering the reactor as a function of time as shown below.

Definitions that are contained in text incorporated by reference are excluded to the extent that they contradict definitions in this disclosure.

The present technology thus generally described will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting.

The concentration profiles of the metal transition source solution into the reactor of nickel and manganese as a function of time were obtained under different process conditions. In all examples the flow rate from the Ni rich solution to the reactor Q was kept constant at 1 L hr. In practice this flow rate could be set at any value and may vary with time. In all examples the total molar concentration of both the Mn rich and the Ni rich solutions were 2 M. In practice any concentration can be used and the concentration may vary with time. In all examples the initial concentration C at the start of the process t 0 was 100 mole percent mol of Ni. In practice any initial concentration can be used. In all examples the flow rate from the Mn rich solution to the Ni rich solution was between 0.5 and 2 L hr. In practice any flow rate for the Mn rich and Ni rich can be used. In all examples the volume of Ni rich solution was 4 L. In practice any volume can be used. In all examples the concentration of the Mn rich solution was between 50 and 100 mol . In all examples the process was carried out for 6 to 8 hours. In all examples the Mn rich solution was fed between 0 and 2 hours after the process was started and 4 L of Mn rich solution was fed. In practice the Mn rich solution could be fed at any time and in any quantity.

Transition metal particles were produced under the following conditions Four liters of Mn rich solution of 100 mol of Mn was fed at 1 L hr for 4 hours and mixed with a Ni rich solution composed of 100 mol of Ni with an initial volume of 4 L. The concentration profile is shown in . The relative Ni concentration drops from 100 mol to 36.8 mol . Correspondingly the Mn concentration increased from 0 mol to 63.2 mol over 4 hours. After 4 hours a solution with a constant concentration of 36.8 mol of Ni and 63.2 mol of Mn was fed to the reactor for an additional 4 hours.

The concentration of the metal source solution fed to the reactor as a function of time was determined when 4 L of 100 mol of Mn in a Mn rich solution was fed at 0.5 L hr for 8 hours and mixed with a Ni rich solution composed of 100 mol of Ni with an initial volume of 4 L. The flow rate of the Mn rich solution has been reduced by a half as compared to Example 1. The concentration profile is shown in . As the Ni concentration dropped from 100 mol to 0.1 mol the Mn concentration increased from 0 mol to 99.9 mol over 8 hours.

The concentration of the feed to the reactor as a function of time was determined when 4 L of 100 mol of Mn in a Mn rich solution was fed at 2 L hr for 2 hours and mixed with a Ni rich solution composed of 100 mol of Ni with an initial volume of 4 L. The flow rate of the Mn rich solution has been doubled as compared to Example 1. The concentration profile is shown in . The relative Ni concentration dropped from 100 mol to 44.4 mol . Correspondingly the Mn concentration increased from 0 mol to 55.6 mol over 2 hours. After 2 hours a solution with a constant concentration of 44.4 mol of Ni and 55.6 mol of Mn was fed to the reactor for an additional 6 hours.

The concentration profiles for the Ni fed to the reactor in Examples 1 2 and 3 are shown in . The final Ni concentration in the transition metal source solution was 0 36.8 and 44.4 mol for the three different flow rates for the Mn rich solution 0.5 1 and 2 L hr. Increasing the flow rate of the Mn rich solution by a factor of four changed the Ni concentration in the reactor form 44.4 mol to 0 even though total amount of Ni fed to the reactor remains constant. The Ni and Mn in the transition metal source solution gets incorporated into the precipitated particles and the gradient in composition in the particles can be tuned. For the Mn rich solution flow rates of 0.5 1 and 2 L hr the Ni composition decreases at a rate of 12.5 15.8 and 27.8 mol hr. Thus in Examples 1 2 and 3 the gradient in the Ni concentration in the transition metal source solution fed to the reactor changes sharply when the flow rate of the Mn rich solution is adjusted. Controlling the gradient in the composition is important for avoiding particle pulverization during cycling due to volume expansion mismatches between materials of different compositions. If for example a core of one composition and a shell of a different composition are grown without a gradient the differences in the volume expansion between the core and shell can result in void regions between the two during cycling. A gradient in composition allows the differences in expansion to be diffused out over a greater distance to reduce the stress at an single point plane interface within the material.

The concentration of the transition metal source solution fed to the reactor as a function of time was determined when 4 L of 50 mol of Mn and 50 mol of Ni was fed at 1 L hr for 4 hours and mixed with a Ni rich solution composed of 100 mol of Ni with an initial volume of 4 L. In contrast to Example 1 the concentration of the Mn rich solution was halved 50 mol of Mn as compared to 100 mol of Mn. The concentration profile is shown in . The Ni concentration dropped from 100 mol to 68.4 mol . Correspondingly the Mn concentration increased from 0 mol to 31.6 mol over 4 hours. After 4 hours a solution with a constant concentration of 68.4 mol of Ni and 31.6 mol of Mn was fed to the reactor for an additional 4 hours.

The Ni mol as a function of time for Examples 1 and 5 are shown in . The concentration of the Mn rich solution was adjusted to tune the Ni concentration in the reactor and subsequently the concentration of Ni in the particles. shows that the Ni concentration increases from 36.8 mol to 68.4 mol when the manganese rich feed concentration was increased from 0 to 50 mol of Ni.

The concentration of Mn and Ni in the reactor as a function of time was determined when 4 L of 100 mol of Mn was fed at 1 L hr for 4 hours and mixed with a Ni rich solution composed of 100 mol of Ni after the Ni rich solution had already been fed to the reactor for 2 hours. The initial volume of the Ni rich solution was 2 L and it was half the initial volume as compared to Example 1 because the Mn rich feed is fed 2 hours later than in Example 1. The concentration profile is shown in .

Over the first 2 hours of the process 100 mol of Ni was fed to the reactor. The relative Ni concentration dropped from 100 mol to 13.5 mol . Correspondingly the Mn concentration increased from 0 mol to 86.5 mol over the 4 hour period from 2 to 6 hours after starting the Ni rich feed into the reactor. After 6 hours a solution with a constant concentration of 13.5 mol of Ni and 86.5 mol of Mn was fed to the reactor for an additional 2 hours

In Example 1 the Mn rich feed was fed to the Ni rich solution at the start of the process t 0 . In contrast in Example 7 the Mn rich feed was fed to the Ni rich solution after the Ni rich solution has been fed to the reactor for 2 hours. The Ni mol as a function of time for Examples 1 and 7 are shown in . By delaying the mixing of the Mn rich the particles have a Ni core before outer layers with Mn are formed.

An Mn rich solution 3 L of 2 M MnSO was pumped into the Ni rich solution 3 L of 2 M NiSO to form the transition metal source solution. The transition metal source solution was fed into the reactor. Simultaneously a second aqueous solution comprised of 2 M NaCOand 0.2 M NHOH was fed to the reactor at a rate that maintained the pH inside the reactor at 8.0. The temperature inside the reactor was kept at 60 C. The process was run for a total of 6 hours. The molar compositions of Mn and Ni fed to the reactor as a function of time is shown in .

At the end of the 6 hour process described in Example 9 particles were collected from the reactor thoroughly rinsed with distilled water filtered and dried at 100 C. to remove water. Inductively coupled plasma ICP analysis confirmed the composition of the material to be on average MnNiCO. Scanning electron micrographs SEMs of the MnNiCOmaterial at two different magnifications can be found in . The MnNiCOparticles are approximately spherical with sizes ranging from 10 M to 40 m. The material was embedded in a resin and cut with a microtome to reveal the internal morphology and composition of the particles. The SEMs in and the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy EDXS was measured at locations 1 through 4 on the particle. The results show that the relative transition metal composition of the particles increases from 27.1 Mn in the core to 62.1 Mn at the surface Mn Ni 100 . Thermal gravimetric analysis TGA in and the X ray diffraction pattern shown in for the material are consistent with the majority of the MnNiCObeing comprised of MnCO type materials.
