This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 250 201 filed Oct. 9 2009 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The work described herein was supported in part by National Institute of Health grant 10 03 01122a. The United States government may have certain rights in this application.

The present invention relates to 2 2 di substituted dipyrrins. The invention also relates to methods for the preparation of 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrins and to the use of 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrins in for example sensing imaging and laser applications.

Boron dipyrromethenes commonly known as BODIPY form one of the most popular groups of organic flurophores attracting interest from applications due to their high emission yields photostability and versatile chemistry. The organic part of the BODIPY molecule is dipyrromethene dipyrrin which is responsible for the strongly allowed transition in the visible region of the spectrum. Coordination with boron rigidifies the dipyrrin skeleton resulting in yet more intense absorption and bright fluorescence.

However unlike BODIPY the majority of metallodipyrrins do not fluoresce. Moreover the interplay between the structure and the photophysical properties of metallodipyrrins has not yet been fully established and overall metallodipyrrins are presently considered poorly emissive species.

The synthesis of dipyrrin compounds has been described for example by Maekawa et al. 101 847 1968 and Shen et al. 10 4853 4871 2004. However these processes suffer from certain drawbacks such as lack of substitution capabilities and or low functional group tolerance.

Thus there remains a need in the art for new highly emissive metallodipyrrin complexes that may be useful in e.g. sensing imaging and laser applications. Moreover there also remains a need in the art for new processes for the synthesis of fluorogenic dipyrrin chelators that afford such compounds in improved yields and or purities and is amenable to the introduction of a wide range of functional group substituents.

The 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrin DPM compounds of the present invention readily form complexes with metal ions. In contrast metallation of DPMs without 2 2 substitutents typically requires heating and or the presence of bases and typically results in non emissive products.

Applicants have surprisingly found that upon formation of a metal complex the color of a solution a 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrin compound of the present invention undergoes a dramatic change. For example in certain embodiments in the case of complexation of Zn or Ca by a 2 2 diethoxycarbonyl substituted dipyrrins the color of a solution immediately changes from purple to deep blue. In different embodiments the complex forming ability of a 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrin compound as described herein varies with the ligand and the solvent used. Typically in certain embodiments the complexes exhibit extremely high stability constants in particular complexes formed with for example calcium or zinc. As a result in further embodiments the presence of even trace amount of metal ions leads to a drastic change in the solution color.

The free base dipyrrins and meso aryl dipyrrins of the present invention exhibit broad featureless absorption spectra and fluorescence only weakly 0.01 0.02 . Upon treatment with organic bases such as EtN DBU etc. dipyrrins including their meso arylated derivatives easily form anions whose spectra are red shifted compared to those of the respective free bases. These anions also fluoresce very weakly 0.01 0.02 . However Applicants have discovered that metal complexes of 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrins as described herein exhibit extremely bright fluorescence which in most cases can be readily detected by the naked eye. shows the fluorescence spectra for Zn meso 4 methoxycarbonyl phenyl 2 2 ditertbutoxycarbonyl dibenzodipyrrin and several metals salts thereof. Table 3 gives optical properties of several metal complexes of 2 2 diethoxycarbonyl dibenzopyrromethenes described herein.

As can be seen from Table 3 the fluorescence quantum yields vary between the metal complexes. In certain embodiments the quantum yield is between about 0.1 and about 0.8. In certain embodiments the quantum yield is highest for example for Zn Ca Cd Y La Gd Lu complexes.

Moreover Applicants have surprisingly found that the fluoresence properties of a metal complex can be altered e.g. switched on or switched off by altering the mode of metal coordination.

In certain embodiments the 2 2 disubstituted DPM ligands L described herein are in the form of a mono complex ML with a metal M. In certain embodiments the 2 2 disubstituted DPM ligands L described herein are in the form of a bis complex ML with a metal M. In certain embodiments the 2 2 disubstituted DPM ligands L described herein are in equilibrium between mono ML and bis ML forms M metal e.g. zinc calcium .

In certain embodiments the bis ML complex form exhibits little or no fluorescence. In other embodiments the mono ML complex form exhibits strong fluorescence.

In certain embodiments spectral transision of 2 2 disubstituted compounds described herein can be tuned into a desired range. For example in certin embodiments spectral transision of 2 2 disubstituted compounds described herein can be tuned into a desired range by varying the degree of conjugation. In certain embodiments spectral transision of 2 2 disubstituted compounds described herein can be tuned without altering the chelating ability of the compound.

Without wishing to be bound by theory Applicants believe that the high lability of 2 2 dialkoxycarbonyl substituted DPMs may be a result of destabilization due to steric strain induced by the 2 2 substituents and the electron withdrawing effects of these substituents. When positioned in close proximity to chelating nitrogen atoms the carbonyl groups may decrease the bascicity of the ligand and fascilitate exchange reactions.

Morever and also without wishing to be bound by theory Applicants believe that the difference in fluorescence and lack of fluorescence of the MLcomplexes is due to an exciton coupling effect. In one embodiment mono ML complexes are fluorescent bis MLcomplexes are not fluorescent.

As described above the 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrins described herein undergo dramatic color changes upon complexation with metal ions.

In one embodiment the compound is used in an imagaing application. In one embodiment the compound is used in a laser application.

In a typical experiment a metal salt 100 mg was added to a solvent 3 ml followed by the addition of a few drops of a highly concentrated solution of the 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrin ligand. The resulting slurry was rigorously stirred for about 30 seconds then optionally filtered through a cotton cloth.

For example meso 4 MeOC CH 2 2 di ethoxycarbonyl dibenzo b g dipyrrin was mixed with an excess of zinc acetate Zn OAc in acetone. A dark blue blue solution resulted. The absorption and emission spectra of this soliution are shown in max 642 nm . Upon standing overnight dark crystals of the homoleptic ZnLcomplex L meso 4 MeOC CH 5 5 dnethoxycarbonyl dibenzo b g dipyrrin precipitated form the solution. The ZnLcrystals were found to be highy soluble in toluene methylene chloride and pyridine but were poorly soluble in alcohols acetone and DMF. A pyridine solution of ZnLcompound showed no fluorescence. Upon addition of an excess of ZnCl however the original spectrum as shown in slowly redeveloped max 642 nm . After approximately 16 hours the original spectrum fully developed and fluorescence was fully regained. See H NMR spectra for a sample of ZnLin dpyridine before and after addition of an excess of ZnClare shown in . The ab initio computed model DFT B3LYP 6 31G d of the ZnLcomplex is shown in

Cd meso Ar 2 2 di tert butoxycarbonyl dibenzopyrromethene Ar 3 5 tBuCH was prepared in a similar manner as described above. shows the X ray crystallographic structure of Cd meso Ar 2 2 di tert butoxycarbonyl dibenzopyrromethene Ar 3 5 tBuCH .

To prepare a sample suitable for photophysical measurement a solution of a metal complex was diluted to achieve a concentration suitable for fluorescence quantum yield measurements 

Spectroscopic grade solvents were used in the preparation of metal complex samples for photophysical measurements. In certain cases a solution of a free base 2 2 disubstituted dipyrrin ligand was treated with a small amount of trifluoracetic acid TFA in order to prevent complex formation with trace amount of metal impurities contained in the solvent. However in certain solvents e.g. MeOH relatively pure samples of free base ligands could be obtained without the TFA treatment.
