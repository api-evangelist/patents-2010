The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to helix antennas and more particularly to methods of feeding and matching bifilar and or quadrifilar slotted helix antennas. In one possible embodiment a pipe of cables passes through the slotted helix antenna.

A bifilar helix antenna comprises two antenna elements. A quadrifilar helix antenna effectively has two bifilar antennas spaced ninety degrees apart from each other about the antenna axis.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 349 824 to E. Harris issued Sep. 14 1982 discloses an around a mast quadrifilar microstrip antenna where a down link UHF antenna is designed which includes four equally spaced arms plated at an angle on a fiberglass cylinder. A coaxial connector is connected to each of the four arms with the metal plated inner surface as the common ground. This helix has an inner metal cylinder which serves as the metal plated inner surface described above inserted up its axis to allow cables and other functions to pass the antenna. This forces the normal on axis quadrature feed point to be spread out symmetrically to at least the diameter of the inner cylinder. The presence of the inner cylinder symmetrically placed within the antenna allows the feed end of each element to be referenced to the common cylinder so that that the feed end of each element can be fed via the center conductor of a coaxial cable whose outer conductor is connected to the inside of the common cylinder. The common cylinder can be referenced as a ground plane only if it is large enough to the extent where coupling between an element and the cylinder dominates coupling between an element and its radially opposite corresponding bifilar element. The antenna is fed via four coaxial cables that feed in phase quadrature all referenced to the common cylinder. Placement of an inner cylinder on the antenna axis reduces the bandwidth of the antenna. Bandwidth decreases with the diameter of the inner cylinder. Thus the inner cylinder should be of minimum diameter.

Normally a prior art helix antenna is wrapped about a cylinder axially centered on the antenna axis for a certain number of turns or pitch angle.

In the feed region the two elements of a bifilar antenna bend radially and taper in width towards the axis to two points which become the feed point of the helix. The bent and tapered section of the element may be referred to as a feed arm. The two feed points are fed one hundred eighty degrees apart in phase. For the quadrifilar helix antenna ninety degrees is added or subtracted to the feed phase of the second bifilar pair depending upon which end of the helix the unidirectional pattern is to radiate from.

A typical impedance locus of a bifilar helix antenna when the total element length is wavelength and the diameter is 0.1 to 0.2 wavelengths starts as an open circuit impedance at zero frequency and spirals quickly with frequency to and through a low resonance resistance of R. Typical values of Rare in the range of 5 to 10 ohms. Other impedance resonances are also possible such as wavelength shorted and wavelength open. They are similar to the wavelength open impedance except for the fact that they have higher Rvalues.

The bandwidth of the helix is reduced some by the indirect path of an antenna element from the feed point to the end thereof. This is largely due to the bend where the radial sections of the antenna elements begin. Maximum bandwidth occurs with a minimum path length straight path from the feed point to the element end while maintaining the antenna radius volume. Any extra path length adds inductance to the impedance of the element.

A shorted end fire slot antenna typically has an exponential taper of the antenna elements. Beyond the feed point the antenna is open where most of the radiation occurs. Before the feed point is a shorted inductive section. Since the shorted section is implemented on the antenna a small radiation is associated with it. If the shorted section becomes narrow enough it essentially becomes an inductance with no radiation loss and thus can be replaced by a simple inductance. Radiation from the shorted section will improve overall antenna impedance bandwidth.

Two possible geometries are utilized in the shorted section. In one geometry a common elongated path realizes an inductance and an alternative geometry where the slot is simply continued and then shorted. The shorted section is an inductance that matches the antenna. The inductive short wraps the low frequency part of the resonance locus from near an open impedance to a short introducing a loop which can increase bandwidth over the bandwidth of the frequencies of the loop. At some point part or all of the locus loop wraps about or is centered about a higher R which may preferably be 50 ohms which is partially determined by the width and the taper of the slot. The locus is tighter and has more bandwidth for wider antennas because radiation also starts to occur along the width dimension perpendicular to the slot of the antenna.

An open end fire slot is combined with a flared bowtie antenna to make a hybrid antenna called the Slotline Bowtie Hybrid Antenna. From the feed end of the slot the antenna flares out in a bowtie shape in the cylindrical space square to the slot surface and parallel to the slot axis. The slot edge becomes two dimensional thus increasing the possible bandwidth of the antenna. The antenna has large pattern and impedance bandwidth.

In certain prior art quadrifilar helix antennas the four antenna elements taper radially radial feed arm sections of elements from a quadrature feed point and then bend over the end of a support tube to continue down the length of the tube as a helix. On certain of these antennas the antenna elements are metal tubes. To allow cables to pass the antenna a sheath of cables passes by most of the antenna by existing on the antenna axis which is an rf 0 point. At the feed point the sheath of cables bends around the feed point between two radial feed arms and then continues along the antenna axis. Although the bend introduces an asymmetry in the geometry it only has a small effect on antenna impedance and pattern symmetry.

The present invention provides an alternate method of feeding and matching a bifilar or quadrifilar helix antenna. In one embodiment of the invention a pipe of cables passes the antenna.

It is a general purpose of the present invention to provide an improved bifilar or quadrifilar helix antenna.

One possible object of the present invention is to provide a slot which may be utilized to feed a bifilar or quadrifilar helix.

Another possible object of the present invention is to utilize a slot to increase the impedance bandwidth of a bifilar or quadrifilar helix.

Another possible object of the present invention is to utilize a slot for better impedance matching to a small bifilar or small quadrifilar helix when the end thereof is shorted.

Accordingly the present invention provides a slotted helix antenna which may comprise elements such as for example a plurality of helical antenna elements. Each helical antenna element may comprise an outer planar surface which spirals around an antenna axis. A slot element is secured to a central interior portion of the outer planar surface. The slot element extends radially inwardly from the outer planar surface. Each slot element provides an interior slot element edge whereby two radially opposite interior slot element edges define at least one tapered slot therebetween.

A point may be provided at an end of the antenna where the plurality of slot elements are electrically shorted together. For instance opposing slot element edges are shorted together. A feed point is axially offset with respect the antenna axis from the shorted point.

 is the angular distance between the slot axis and a given point on the slot edge where the center of the angle is at the shorted end of the helix. varies from zero at the shorted end to at the further most end point of the slot edge. R is the distance from the shorted point to a given point on the slot edge for a given value of . Ris the maximum distance from the shorted point to furthermost end point of the slot element 

K is a constant determined by the conditions at Rmax and at the shorted end of the slot where and R are zero and

a is the constant of exponentiation that determines the rate of exponentiation of the slot element edge.

The slotted helix antenna may further comprise a coaxial cable having an outer conductor and center conductor at the feed point. The coaxial cable provides electrical connections with the slot element edges.

In one embodiment the slotted helix antenna may further comprise a feed pipe which extends through the slot. At the shorted point the slot elements are electrically shorted to the pipe. At the feed point at least two coaxial cables provide electrical connections to opposite sides of the pipe and to at least two of the plurality of slot element edges. These at least two slot element edges must be a radial pair i.e. two edges 180 degrees apart.

The present invention also provides a method for making a slotted helix antenna which may comprise method steps such as for example providing a plurality of helical antenna elements wherein the helical antenna element comprise an outer planar surface which spirals around an antenna axis. The helical elements may further comprise a slot element secured to a central interior portion of the outer planar surface. The slot elements extend radially inwardly from the outer planar surface.

Other steps may comprise providing that the slot element extends along at least a portion of the length of the outer planar surface and that each slot element defines at least one slot element edge. Two radially opposite of slot element edges define one tapered slot therebetween.

Other steps may comprise providing a shorted point at which the plurality of slot elements are electrically shorted e.g. a single pair of slot elements in the bifilar slot helix antenna are shorted together. Opposing pairs of slot elements in the quadrifilar slot helix antenna are shorted together.

Other steps may comprise providing a feed point axially offset from the shorted point with respect the antenna axis.

The method may comprise providing that at the feed point a coaxial cable makes a connection to one or two slot element edges.

The method may further comprise providing a feed pipe which extends through the slot. The method may further comprise providing that at the shorted point the slot elements are electrically shorted to the pipe. The method must further comprise providing that at the feed point two coaxial cables are connected to the pipe and to two of the radially opposite of slot element edges.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there is shown a bifilar slotted helix antenna which is one possible embodiment of slotted helix antenna of the present invention. shows a side perspective view of a bifilar slotted helix antenna with helical antenna elements and untwisted to a helix pitch angle of 90 degrees. The helix pitch angle of helical antenna elements will normally be lower than 90 degrees as shown in and .

The outer planar surfaces and of the helix elements of the antenna are shown with a flat outer planar surface as opposed to rounded for easier viewing.

While four antenna elements and are shown for the quadrifilar case in when discussing the bifilar case it will be understood that two radially opposite elements comprise a bifilar helix e.g. antenna elements and . Two pairs of bifilar antenna elements ninety degrees apart from each other along the antenna axis constitute a quadrifilar helix e.g. antenna elements and are ninety degrees apart from antenna elements and . Normally antenna elements and have rounded outer planar surfaces and respectively that wind around the cylinder of the antenna but are shown flat for easier viewing and are shown unwound in and .

Outer planar surfaces and are the portions of the antenna elements and which lay along the length and planar surface of slotted helix antenna .

Interior radial sections and are radial sections of antenna elements and that bend and taper towards short of the helix. In prior art helix antennas what is the shorted end of the antenna would have been the feed point of the antenna. Interior radial sections and are tapered to the width of the outer planar surfaces and respectively as opposed to being simple wires to reduce excessive inductance and to reduce the distance from the feed point to the end of the antenna which also reduces excessive inductance. Excessive inductance reduces impedance bandwidth.

With the introduction of slot and its associated slotted elements and in the slotted helix antenna of the present invention the width of the slot elements such as slot elements and and the new direct and thus reduced radiation path length from the feed point to the open end of the antenna reduces excessive inductance. Since radial interior sections and no longer have significant radiation due to not being part of the main radiation path and due to the presence of the slot elements their inductance reducing features are no longer important. Also since the slot elements also provide a shorting path across the end of the antenna in one possible embodiment radial interior sections and may simply be replaced by the ends of slot elements and .

In bifilar helix slot elements and define slot . For the quadrifilar helix case there are effectively two slots which are fed and arranged 90 degrees apart about the antenna axis.

Edges and define slot . shows various features and parameters associated with equations that describe slot . The taper of edges and is exponential. The equations below are in polar form in that the distance to a point on the slot from its shorted end is determined by the angle relative to the axis of the slot. To more conveniently measure angle which is as discussed below or any angle as indicated at pseudo axis line is drawn parallel to the axis of the antenna but is offset by W 2 where W is the width at short of slot .

 is the angular distance between the pseudo slot axis and a given point on the slot edge where the center of the angle is at the shorted end of the helix on the pseudo axis. varies from zero at the shorted end to at the further most end point of the slot edge. R is the distance from the shorted point to a given point on the slot edge for a given value of . R is the maximum distance from shorted end to end point at the end of slot where end point is the furthest most point on slot element from shorted end . Other examples of any distance R may be provided as indicated by line which terminates along edge at point .

K is a constant determined by the conditions at Rmax and at the shorted end of the slot where and R are zero.

a is the constant of exponentiation that determines the rate of exponentiation of slot and determines what part of the exponential curve is used to define the slot shape. At one extreme the curve is linear. Close to the other extreme the curve is highly curved near the end of slot being almost square in shape.

Referring to and seams or connections lines and are the seams or connection lines at the centers of antenna elements and by which the radially outermost edge of slot elements and must be connected by solder or other means to the center of outer planar surfaces and of the quadrifilar or for bifilar slotted helix antenna .

Referring to feed point is the feed point of a bifilar version of slotted helix antenna utilizing coaxial cable . In this example the sheath or outer conductor of coaxial cable is soldered to edge and the path along between feed point and the end of the helix near and the center conductor is connected to edge . For the quadrifilar case each bifilar antenna has a feed point as perhaps best shown in or with the two resulting feed points and being fed with signals having a ninety degree phase difference and utilizing coaxial cables and . As discussed hereinbefore the outer conductor of the coaxial cable is connected to the edge of a slot element and the center conductor is connected to the edge of the corresponding opposite slot element at the feed point.

Referring to and when pipe is used on the antenna axis two coaxial cables instead of one are shown to feed the bifilar slotted helix antenna. For the case of a pipe up the antenna axis two coaxial cables may be utilized such as coaxial cables and because it would be difficult to spread the feed point of a single coaxial cable around a finite circumference of a pipe to feed both edges of the slot. If only one coaxial cable is used then the center conductor must be spread around the pipe for a finite length which adds inductance to the antenna impedance and also can unbalance the feed point.

Pipe is a conductive pipe that may be utilized to carry wires inside the pipe past the short and the feed points in accord with one possible embodiment of the present invention.

Two feed points and on opposite sides of pipe are utilized in the type of feed shown in . The feed points being fed 180 degrees apart utilizing two coaxial cables and by feed signals that are 180 degrees out of phase e.g. by utilizing a 180 degree splitter not shown . However in the type of feed shown in again two feed points and on are utilized on opposite sides of pipe but a zero degree splitter is utilized. The reasons for this and the types of feeds and various permutations thereof are discussed hereinafter.

For the quadrifilar case where pipe is used as shown in slot elements and are shorted to pipe as indicated at shorts .

At the feed position for the quadrifilar helix antenna case as indicated at four feed points and are fed with four coaxial cables and . The feed points are fed with the traditional quadrature feed phase of a quadrifilar helix whereby in a circle around the four resultant feed points the adjacent feed points are physically separated by 90 degrees. Each corresponding feed signal advances or recedes 90 degrees in phase.

As shown in feed coaxial cables such as feed coaxial cables and are introduced at short and then snake along slot elements and with the outside of the outer conductor electrically connected to the element surface and are then connected to the respective edge of the slot elements edges and . In this example each respective center conductor of the coaxial cables connects to the pipe and each inside of the outer conductor connects to one of the edges. In this manner the antenna is being used as an infinite balun to allow introduction of a feed cable on the antenna.

Note that the introduction of the pipe provides for at least three ways to feed an antenna element. 1 A coaxial cable is introduced at short and snakes its way to the feed point along the slot element as already discussed. 2 A coaxial cable is introduced at short and snakes its way to the feed point along the outside of the pipe. At the feed point the inside of the outer conductor connects to the pipe and the center conductor feeds the slot element. 3 A coaxial cable is introduced at the short and snakes its way to the feed point along the inside of the pipe. At the feed point the cable protrudes through the pipe and the inside of the outer conductor connects to the pipe while the center conductor feeds the slot element. Permutations of the above three ways to feed the slot elements are possible one example of which is shown in where ways 1 and 3 are combined.

With the introduction of two feed coaxial cables per bifilar helix for the pipe case as opposed to one feed coaxial cable without the pipe now the two cables are suitably fed with a 3 db power splitter. If both antenna elements of a bifilar pair are fed the same way using only 1 of the 3 possible ways discussed above a 180 degree splitter is used. If one element is fed with the center conductor of a cable and the other element is fed with the outer conductor of a cable using some cases of 2 of the 3 possible ways discussed above a zero degree splitter is used.

Note that feed methods with the cable snaking along the pipe is allowed because the cables are introduced at an rf 0 point the short on the antenna. If the antenna is open an element can only be fed from a cable on the pipe then in this case the symmetrically centered pipe places the pipe itself at an rf 0 point.

Referring to the edges may be as indicated at and for the case where the slot length is largely reduced in case the slot length produces pattern problems. Pattern problems probably can occur when the length of the antenna is larger than wavelength.

In prior art helix antennas feed points were at the short of the helix antenna of the present invention. With the introduction of the slot since helix elements and slot elements are connected the original radial feed section of the helix and can be eliminated.

Distance in is the maximum width of the slot which also becomes the diameter of slotted helix antenna . In the antennas tested the width is 0.1 wavelength at 1 GHz.

Referring to distance is the width of the helix elements. In one example distance is one inch which is somewhat less than 0.1 wavelength at 1 GHz. Distance is the length of the slot and helix elements. Lengths tested were 0.25 0.5 and 0.75 wavelengths at 1 GHz. Distance is the circumference of slotted helix antenna . Line is a line parallel and midway between helix elements where the metal or metal plated sheet where the antenna elements are mounted on is cut and unwrapped from the antenna cylinder to a plane to more easily view slotted helix antenna .

The pitch angle of the antenna is the angle with the horizon when the antenna axis is mounted vertical. For ease of construction and viewing the antenna elements are vertical and thus the pitch angle is 90 degrees. For most cases this angle will be less and the element will be twisted about the antenna axis which is much harder to construct. Lower pitch angles will also increase impedance bandwidth.

Referring to is the horizon plane above which slotted helix antenna is normally mounted. Horizon plane might be further divided to the front of the plane and the back of the plane. Cylinder or other shape is the structure on which slotted helix antenna is mounted which determines the antenna shape. Line is the antenna axis. utilizes contour lines to show the shape of a slot element which in this example is slot element . Seam or connection line connects to the outer planar surface not shown in but is shown in and . The slot the helix and the shorted end regions with the radial shorted sections may be mounted to sheet material. In the previously built antennas the slot and helix were 4 mil copper tape mounted to 5 mil mylar sheet.

For the wavelength long open antennas impedance reactance to impedance resistance curves reactance normalized to resistance at the first wavelength resonance showed the antenna with the slot removed a prior art helix antenna has a normalized reactance changing quicker with frequency than some of the slotted helix antenna versions ignoring the small difference in frequency location of the resonances . The VSWR 3 1 bandwidth of the normal helix is 4.8 the bandwidth of a slotted helix antenna with a taper where a 0.3 is 6.3 . Thus the addition of the slot does improve the bandwidth as compared to a prior art helix antenna.

Some slot tapers do not improve bandwidth. Other factors such as excessive capacitance along the slot for cases where the taper is almost square in shape may decrease bandwidth.

The prior art helix antenna has a lower resonant frequency than the slotted helix antennas. This shows that the slots do reduce the path length from the feed to the end of the antenna.

Similar observations can be made for the wavelength antennas. The resonant frequency of the prior art helix antenna is lower than the slotted helix antennas at and wavelength resonances. At the wavelength resonance the slope of the normalized reactance is appreciably larger for the prior art helix antenna. At wavelength resonance there is little difference.

For the case of the antenna length from the feed point to its open end being wavelength at 1 GHz and the taper is with a 0.3 in tests it was found that the locus rotates counterclockwise towards the upper left quadrant of the Smith Chart and then towards a short as the amount of shunting increases from almost none to almost total shunting where the impedance is essentially a short. Increasing the shunting is accomplished by moving the short closer to the feed point. Along the way an intermediate value of inductance allows the area of the impedance below the low resistance resonance to wrap nicely about 50 ohms.

Various alternatives are available. For example extreme alternatives of the antenna can be made by removing parts of the antenna and or simplifying the geometry. In one alternative the radius of the antenna becomes small enough so the presence of the slot is not required to reduce the excessive path length of the elements due to radius since the separation of the feed point is small. More generally this alternative may occur when all of the slot except for two radial lengths at the feed point is simply removed and the bandwidth loss due to increased resultant element path length can be tolerated.

Like a prior art quadrifilar helix the radial feed lengths could be flared normal to the axis as the radial sections and are in the original antenna to at least reduce excessive bandwidth robbing inductance on the radial feed lengths. In the extreme case where the radial feed lengths are short inductance is small and the flares can be removed.

In one example edges of the slot elements such as edges and may be substantially or entirely removed so that only short stubs remain to provide a path for the radial feed lengths to the helix elements. The outer conductor of the feed cable is one of the paths to one of the antenna elements. Since the slot element part of the helix element would be gone the feed cable would now snake along the circumferential part of the helix element down the flared section at the antenna end and to the short . Another dummy piece of cable can lead to the other antenna element feed point.

Yet another variation fills the rounded T shape cross sectional view of an antenna element to have a triangular shape so there is no longer any distinction between the slot element and outer planar surface of a helical antenna element. Filling the area between the slot element and outer planar surface increases the shunt capacitance across a bifilar pair lowering the impedance of the antenna. The capacitance may become excessive to the point of lowering bandwidth thus only a partial filling of the area may be desirable.

In general it can be said for a given antenna structure composed of two spaced apart parallel element surfaces parallel to the axis through its feed points maximum bandwidth is obtained when all paths are established from a given feed point to all of the edges of its fed element and the lengths of the paths are minimized. The paths flaring from a feed point to the element edges establishes another new surface which to a large extent shadows the original element surfaces and volume between the original surface and new surface and thus the volume and any parts of the elements inside the volume can be eliminated. It may be concluded that the slot fed helix is only a partial solution to reducing path length from the feed point to the element edges since it reduces path length only along the length dimension of the original helix element. The triangular shape antenna elements provide a total solution since this shape also reduces the path length to the width of the outer planar surfaces.

Variations of the shunt inductance section between the feed point and the short will change the shunt inductance used to match the shorted case of the antenna. Increasing the distance between the feed point and short or decreasing the width of the section will increase the inductance. The extreme case is when the section is simply a narrow inductive wire. Decreasing the width would reduce any small radiation from the section. This may be required if the radiation is found to be undesirable.

Many additional changes in the details components steps and organization of the system herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
