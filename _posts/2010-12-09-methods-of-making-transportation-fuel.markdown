The Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Agreement No. ERD 05 2516 between UT Battelle LLC operating under prime contract No. DE ACO5 00OR22725 for the US Department of Energy and Shell Exploration and Production Company.

The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations. Certain embodiments relate to producing alkylated hydrocarbons from the hydrocarbons produced from the subsurface formations.

Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources as feedstocks and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery processing and or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids composition changes solubility changes density changes phase changes and or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be but is not limited to a gas a liquid an emulsion a slurry and or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.

A wellbore may be formed in a formation. In some embodiments wellbores may be formed using reverse circulation drilling methods. Reverse circulation methods are suggested for example in published U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0079553 to Livingstone and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 854 534 to Livingstone 6 892 829 to Livingstone 7 090 018 to Livingstone and 4 823 890 to Lang the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Reverse circulation methods generally involve circulating a drilling fluid to a drilling bit through an annulus between concentric tubulars to the borehole in the vicinity of the drill bit and then through openings in the drill bit and to the surface through the center of the concentric tubulars with cuttings from the drilling being carried to the surface with the drilling fluid rising through the center tubular. A wiper or shroud may be provided above the drill bit and above a point where the drilling fluid exits the annulus to prevent the drilling fluid from mixing with formation fluids. The drilling fluids may be but is not limited to air water brines and or conventional drilling fluids.

In some embodiments a casing or other pipe system may be placed or formed in a wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. 4 572 299 issued to Van Egmond et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes spooling an electric heater into a well. In some embodiments components of a piping system may be welded together. Quality of formed wells may be monitored by various techniques. In some embodiments quality of welds may be inspected by a hybrid electromagnetic acoustic transmission technique known as EMAT. EMAT is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 389 to Schaps et al. 5 760 307 to Latimer et al. 5 777 229 to Geier et al. and 6 155 117 to Stevens et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Application of heat to oil shale formations is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom and 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. Heat may be applied to the oil shale formation to pyrolyze kerogen in the oil shale formation. The heat may also fracture the formation to increase permeability of the formation. The increased permeability may allow formation fluid to travel to a production well where the fluid is removed from the oil shale formation. In some processes disclosed by Ljungstrom for example an oxygen containing gaseous medium is introduced to a permeable stratum preferably while still hot from a preheating step to initiate combustion.

A heat source may be used to heat a subterranean formation. Electric heaters may be used to heat the subterranean formation by radiation and or conduction. An electric heater may resistively heat an element. U.S. Pat.

The heating element generates radiant energy that heats the casing. A granular solid fill material may be placed between the casing and the formation. The casing may conductively heat the fill material which in turn conductively heats the formation.

The heating element has an electrically conductive core a surrounding layer of insulating material and a surrounding metallic sheath. The conductive core may have a relatively low resistance at high temperatures. The insulating material may have electrical resistance compressive strength and heat conductivity properties that are relatively high at high temperatures. The insulating layer may inhibit arcing from the core to the metallic sheath. The metallic sheath may have tensile strength and creep resistance properties that are relatively high at high temperatures.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 287 to Van Egmond which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes an electrical heating element having a copper nickel alloy core.

Obtaining permeability in an oil shale formation between injection and production wells tends to be difficult because oil shale is often substantially impermeable. Many methods have attempted to link injection and production wells. These methods include hydraulic fracturing such as methods investigated by Dow Chemical and Laramie Energy Research Center electrical fracturing by methods investigated by Laramie Energy Research Center acid leaching of limestone cavities by methods investigated by Dow Chemical steam injection into permeable nahcolite zones to dissolve the nahcolite by methods investigated by Shell Oil and Equity Oil fracturing with chemical explosives by methods investigated by Talley Energy Systems fracturing with nuclear explosives by methods investigated by Project Bronco and combinations of these methods. Many of these methods however have relatively high operating costs and lack sufficient injection capacity.

Large deposits of heavy hydrocarbons heavy oil and or tar contained in relatively permeable formations for example in tar sands are found in North America South America Africa and Asia. Tar can be surface mined and upgraded to lighter hydrocarbons such as crude oil naphtha kerosene and or gas oil. Surface milling processes may further separate the bitumen from sand. The separated bitumen may be converted to light hydrocarbons using conventional refinery methods. Mining and upgrading tar sand is usually substantially more expensive than producing lighter hydrocarbons from conventional oil reservoirs.

In situ production of hydrocarbons from tar sand may be accomplished by heating and or injecting a gas into the formation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 211 230 to Ostapovich et al. and 5 339 897 to Leaute which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describe a horizontal production well located in an oil bearing reservoir. A vertical conduit may be used to inject an oxidant gas into the reservoir for in situ combustion.

U.S. Pat. No. 2 780 450 to Ljungstrom describes heating bituminous geological formations in situ to convert or crack a liquid tar like substance into oils and gases.

No. 5 060 726 to Glandt et al. which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describe preheating a portion of a tar sand formation between an injector well and a producer well. Steam may be injected from the injector well into the formation to produce hydrocarbons at the producer well.

As outlined above there has been a significant amount of effort to develop methods and systems to economically produce hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from hydrocarbon containing formations. At present however there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations from which hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products cannot be economically produced. Thus there is still a need for improved methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from various hydrocarbon containing formations.

Hydrocarbons in formations may be treated in various ways to produce many different products. In certain embodiments hydrocarbons in formations are treated in stages. depicts an illustration of stages of heating the hydrocarbon containing formation. also depicts an example of yield Y in barrels of oil equivalent per ton y axis of formation fluids from the formation versus temperature T of the heated formation in degrees Celsius x axis .

Desorption of methane and vaporization of water occurs during stage heating. Heating of the formation through stage may be performed as quickly as possible. For example when the hydrocarbon containing formation is initially heated hydrocarbons in the formation desorb adsorbed methane. The desorbed methane may be produced from the formation. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated further water in the hydrocarbon containing formation is vaporized. Water may occupy in some hydrocarbon containing formations between 10 and 50 of the pore volume in the formation. In other formations water occupies larger or smaller portions of the pore volume. Water typically is vaporized in a formation between 160 C. and 285 C. at pressures of 600 kPa absolute to 7000 kPa absolute. In some embodiments the vaporized water produces wettability changes in the formation and or increased formation pressure. The wettability changes and or increased pressure may affect pyrolysis reactions or other reactions in the formation. In certain embodiments the vaporized water is produced from the formation. In other embodiments the vaporized water is used for steam extraction and or distillation in the formation or outside the formation. Removing the water from and increasing the pore volume in the formation increases the storage space for hydrocarbons in the pore volume.

In certain embodiments after stage heating the formation is heated further such that a temperature in the formation reaches at least an initial pyrolyzation temperature such as a temperature at the lower end of the temperature range shown as stage . Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed throughout stage . A pyrolysis temperature range varies depending on the types of hydrocarbons in the formation. The pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between 250 C. and 900 C. The pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may extend through only a portion of the total pyrolysis temperature range. In some embodiments the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may include temperatures between 250 C. and 400 C. or temperatures between 270 C. and 350 C. If a temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is slowly raised through the temperature range from 250 C. to 400 C. production of pyrolysis products may be substantially complete when the temperature approaches 400 C. Average temperature of the hydrocarbons may be raised at a rate of less than 5 C. per day less than 2 C. per day less than 1 C. per day or less than 0.5 C. per day through the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products. Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal gradients around the heat sources that slowly raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range.

The rate of temperature increase through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may inhibit mobilization of large chain molecules in the formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may limit reactions between mobilized hydrocarbons that produce undesired products. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the production of high quality high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments the desired temperature is 300 C. 325 C. or 350 C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature. Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at the desired temperature. The heated portion of the formation is maintained substantially at the desired temperature until pyrolysis declines such that production of desired formation fluids from the formation becomes uneconomical. Parts of the formation that are subjected to pyrolysis may include regions brought into a pyrolysis temperature range by heat transfer from only one heat source.

In certain embodiments formation fluids including pyrolyzation fluids are produced from the formation. As the temperature of the formation increases the amount of condensable hydrocarbons in the produced formation fluid may decrease. At high temperatures the formation may produce mostly methane and or hydrogen. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated throughout an entire pyrolysis range the formation may produce only small amounts of hydrogen towards an upper limit of the pyrolysis range. After all of the available hydrogen is depleted a minimal amount of fluid production from the formation will typically occur.

After pyrolysis of hydrocarbons a large amount of carbon and some hydrogen may still be present in the formation. A significant portion of carbon remaining in the formation can be produced from the formation in the form of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas generation may take place during stage heating depicted in . Stage may include heating a hydrocarbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation. For example synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400 C. to about 1200 C. about 500 C. to about 1100 C. or about 550 C. to about 1000 C. The temperature of the heated portion of the formation when the synthesis gas generating fluid is introduced to the formation determines the composition of synthesis gas produced in the formation. The generated synthesis gas may be removed from the formation through a production well or production wells.

Total energy content of fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation may stay relatively constant throughout pyrolysis and synthesis gas generation. During pyrolysis at relatively low formation temperatures a significant portion of the produced fluid may be condensable hydrocarbons that have a high energy content. At higher pyrolysis temperatures however less of the formation fluid may include condensable hydrocarbons. More non condensable formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Energy content per unit volume of the produced fluid may decline slightly during generation of predominantly non condensable formation fluids. During synthesis gas generation energy content per unit volume of produced synthesis gas declines significantly compared to energy content of pyrolyzation fluid. The volume of the produced synthesis gas however will in many instances increase substantially thereby compensating for the decreased energy content.

Heat sources are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources may include heaters such as insulated conductors conductor in conduit heaters surface burners flameless distributed combustors and or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources through supply lines . Supply lines may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters may transport fuel for combustors or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation. In some embodiments electricity for an in situ heat treatment process may be provided by a nuclear power plant or nuclear power plants. The use of nuclear power may allow for reduction or elimination of carbon dioxide emissions from the in situ heat treatment process.

When the formation is heated the heat input into the formation may cause expansion of the formation and geomechanical motion. The heat sources may be turned on before at the same time or during a dewatering process. Computer simulations may model formation response to heating. The computer simulations may be used to develop a pattern and time sequence for activating heat sources in the formation so that geomechanical motion of the formation does not adversely affect the functionality of heat sources production wells and other equipment in the formation.

Heating the formation may cause an increase in permeability and or porosity of the formation. Increases in permeability and or porosity may result from a reduction of mass in the formation due to vaporization and removal of water removal of hydrocarbons and or creation of fractures. Fluid may flow more easily in the heated portion of the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity of the formation. Fluid in the heated portion of the formation may move a considerable distance through the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity. The considerable distance may be over 1000 m depending on various factors such as permeability of the formation properties of the fluid temperature of the formation and pressure gradient allowing movement of the fluid. The ability of fluid to travel considerable distance in the formation allows production wells to be spaced relatively far apart in the formation.

Production wells are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments production well includes a heat source. The heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments the amount of heat supplied to the formation from the production well per meter of the production well is less than the amount of heat applied to the formation from a heat source that heats the formation per meter of the heat source. Heat applied to the formation from the production well may increase formation permeability adjacent to the production well by vaporizing and removing liquid phase fluid adjacent to the production well and or by increasing the permeability of the formation adjacent to the production well by formation of macro and or micro fractures.

More than one heat source may be positioned in the production well. A heat source in a lower portion of the production well may be turned off when superposition of heat from adjacent heat sources heats the formation sufficiently to counteract benefits provided by heating the formation with the production well. In some embodiments the heat source in an upper portion of the production well may remain on after the heat source in the lower portion of the production well is deactivated. The heat source in the upper portion of the well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid.

In some embodiments the heat source in production well allows for vapor phase removal of formation fluids from the formation. Providing heating at or through the production well may 1 inhibit condensation and or refluxing of production fluid when such production fluid is moving in the production well proximate the overburden 2 increase heat input into the formation 3 increase production rate from the production well as compared to a production well without a heat source 4 inhibit condensation of high carbon number compounds Cand above in the production well and or 5 increase formation permeability at or proximate the production well.

Subsurface pressure in the formation may correspond to the fluid pressure generated in the formation. As temperatures in the heated portion of the formation increase the pressure in the heated portion may increase as a result of increased fluid generation and vaporization of water. Controlling rate of fluid removal from the formation may allow for control of pressure in the formation. Pressure in the formation may be determined at a number of different locations such as near or at production wells near or at heat sources or at monitor wells.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations production of hydrocarbons from the formation is inhibited until at least some hydrocarbons in the formation have been pyrolyzed. Formation fluid may be produced from the formation when the formation fluid is of a selected quality. In some embodiments the selected quality includes an API gravity of at least about 20 30 or 40 Inhibiting production until at least some hydrocarbons are pyrolyzed may increase conversion of heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons Inhibiting initial production may minimize the production of heavy hydrocarbons from the formation. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and or reduce the life of production equipment.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations hydrocarbons in the formation may be heated to pyrolysis temperatures before substantial permeability has been generated in the heated portion of the formation. An initial lack of permeability may inhibit the transport of generated fluids to production wells . During initial heating fluid pressure in the formation may increase proximate heat sources . The increased fluid pressure may be released monitored altered and or controlled through one or more heat sources . For example selected heat sources or separate pressure relief wells may include pressure relief valves that allow for removal of some fluid from the formation.

In some embodiments pressure generated by expansion of pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase although an open path to production wells or any other pressure sink may not yet exist in the formation. The fluid pressure may be allowed to increase towards a lithostatic pressure. Fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid approaches the lithostatic pressure. For example fractures may form from heat sources to production wells in the heated portion of the formation. The generation of fractures in the heated portion may relieve some of the pressure in the portion. Pressure in the formation may have to be maintained below a selected pressure to inhibit unwanted production fracturing of the overburden or underburden and or coking of hydrocarbons in the formation.

After pyrolysis temperatures are reached and production from the formation is allowed pressure in the formation may be varied to alter and or control a composition of formation fluid produced to control a percentage of condensable fluid as compared to non condensable fluid in the formation fluid and or to control an API gravity of formation fluid being produced. For example decreasing pressure may result in production of a larger condensable fluid component. The condensable fluid component may contain a larger percentage of olefins.

In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to promote production of formation fluid with an API gravity of greater than 20 . Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit formation subsidence during in situ heat treatment. Maintaining increased pressure may facilitate vapor phase production of fluids from the formation. Vapor phase production may allow for a reduction in size of collection conduits used to transport fluids produced from the formation. Maintaining increased pressure may reduce or eliminate the need to compress formation fluids at the surface to transport the fluids in collection conduits to treatment facilities.

Maintaining increased pressure in a heated portion of the formation may surprisingly allow for production of large quantities of hydrocarbons of increased quality and of relatively low molecular weight. Pressure may be maintained so that formation fluid produced has a minimal amount of compounds above a selected carbon number. The selected carbon number may be at most 25 at most 20 at most 12 or at most 8. Some high carbon number compounds may be entrained in vapor in the formation and may be removed from the formation with the vapor. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit entrainment of high carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds in the vapor. High carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds may remain in a liquid phase in the formation for significant time periods. The significant time periods may provide sufficient time for the compounds to pyrolyze to form lower carbon number compounds.

Generation of relatively low molecular weight hydrocarbons is believed to be due in part to autogenous generation and reaction of hydrogen in a portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation. For example maintaining an increased pressure may force hydrogen generated during pyrolysis into the liquid phase within the formation. Heating the portion to a temperature in a pyrolysis temperature range may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation to generate liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids. The generated liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids components may include double bonds and or radicals. Hydrogen H in the liquid phase may reduce double bonds of the generated pyrolyzation fluids thereby reducing a potential for polymerization or formation of long chain compounds from the generated pyrolyzation fluids. In addition Hmay also neutralize radicals in the generated pyrolyzation fluids. Therefore Hin the liquid phase may inhibit the generated pyrolyzation fluids from reacting with each other and or with other compounds in the formation.

Formation fluid produced from production wells may be transported through collection piping to treatment facilities . Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources . For example fluid may be produced from heat sources to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities . Treatment facilities may include separation units reaction units upgrading units fuel cells turbines storage vessels and or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation. In some embodiments the transportation fuel may be jet fuel such as JP 8.

Formation fluid may be hot when produced from the formation through the production wells. Hot formation fluid may be produced during solution mining processes and or during in situ heat treatment processes. In some embodiments electricity may be generated using the heat of the fluid produced from the formation. Also heat recovered from the formation after the in situ process may be used to generate electricity. The generated electricity may be used to supply power to the in situ heat treatment process. For example the electricity may be used to power heaters or to power a refrigeration system for forming or maintaining a low temperature barrier. Electricity may be generated using a Kalina cycle or a modified Kalina cycle.

The feed spacer may have a thickness of at least 0.6 mm at least 1 mm or at least 3 mm to allow sufficient membrane surface to be packed into a spirally wound module. In some embodiments the feed spacer is a woven feed spacer. During operation a feed mixture may be passed from one end of the cylindrical module between the membrane assemblies along the feed spacer sheet sandwiched between feed sides of the membranes.

Hydrotreating unit may be operated such that all or at least a portion of liquid stream is changed sufficiently to remove compositions and or inhibit formation of compositions that may clog equipment positioned downstream of the hydrotreating unit . The catalyst used in hydrotreating unit may be a commercially available catalyst. In some embodiments hydrotreating of liquid stream is not necessary.

In some embodiments liquid stream is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of one or more catalysts to change one or more desired properties of the crude feed to meet transportation and or refinery specifications. Methods to change one or more desired properties of the crude feed are described in U.S. Published Patent Applications Nos. 20050133414 to Bhan et al. 20050133405 to Wellington et al. and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11 400 542 entitled Systems Methods and Catalysts for Producing a Crude Product filed Apr. 7 2006 Ser. No. 11 425 979 to Bhan entitled Systems Methods and Catalysts for Producing a Crude Product filed Jun. 6 2006 and 11 425 992 to Wellington et al. entitled Systems Methods and Catalysts for Producing a Crude Product filed Jun. 6 2006 all of which are incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments hydrotreating unit is a selective hydrogenation unit. In hydrotreating unit liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream are selectively hydrogenated such that di olefins are reduced to mono olefins. For example liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a DN 200 Criterion Catalysts Technologies Houston Tex. U.S.A. at temperatures ranging from 100 C. to 200 C. and total pressures of 0.1 MPa to 40 MPa to produce liquid stream . Liquid stream includes a reduced content of di olefins and an increased content of mono olefins relative to the di olefin and mono olefin content of liquid stream . The conversion of di olefins to mono olefins under these conditions is in some embodiments at least 50 at least 60 at least 80 or at least 90 . Liquid stream exits hydrotreating unit and enters one or more processing units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit . The units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit may include distillation units catalytic reforming units hydrocracking units hydrotreating units hydrogenation units hydrodesulfurization units catalytic cracking units delayed coking units gasification units or combinations thereof.

Liquid stream may exit hydrotreating unit and enter fractionation unit . Fractionation unit produces one or more crude products. Fractionation may include but is not limited to an atmospheric distillation process and or a vacuum distillation process. Crude products include but are not limited to C Chydrocarbon stream naphtha stream kerosene stream diesel stream and bottoms stream . Bottoms stream generally includes hydrocarbons having a boiling range distribution of at least 340 C. at 0.101 MPa. In some embodiments bottoms stream is vacuum gas oil. In other embodiments bottoms stream includes hydrocarbons with a boiling range distribution of at least 537 C. One or more of the crude products may be sold and or further processed to gasoline or other commercial products.

To enhance the use of the streams produced from formation fluid hydrocarbons produced during fractionation of the liquid stream and hydrocarbon gases produced during separating the process gas may be combined to form hydrocarbons having a higher carbon number. The produced hydrocarbon gas stream may include a level of olefins acceptable for alkylation reactions.

In some embodiments hydrotreated liquid streams and or streams produced from fractions for example distillates and or naphtha are blended with the in situ heat treatment process liquid and or formation fluid to produce a blended fluid. The blended fluid may have enhanced physical stability and chemical stability as compared to the formation fluid. The blended fluid may have a reduced amount of reactive species for example di olefins other olefins and or compounds containing oxygen sulfur and or nitrogen relative to the formation fluid. Thus chemical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may decrease an amount of asphaltenes relative to the formation fluid. Thus physical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may be a more a fungible feed than the formation fluid and or the liquid stream produced from an in situ heat treatment process. The blended feed may be more suitable for transportation for use in chemical processing units and or for use in refining units than formation fluid.

In some embodiments a fluid produced by methods described herein from an oil shale formation may be blended with heavy oil tar sands in situ heat treatment process IHTP fluid. Since the oil shale liquid is substantially paraffinic and the heavy oil tar sands IHTP fluid is substantially aromatic the blended fluid exhibits enhanced stability. In certain embodiments in situ heat treatment process fluid may be blended with bitumen to obtain a feed suitable for use in refining units. Blending of the IHTP fluid and or bitumen with the produced fluid may enhance the chemical and or physical stability of the blended product. Thus the blend may be transported and or distributed to processing units.

C Chydrocarbon stream produced from fractionation unit and hydrocarbon gas stream enter alkylation unit . In alkylation unit reaction of the olefins in hydrocarbon gas stream for example propylene butylenes amylenes or combinations thereof with the iso paraffins in C Chydrocarbon stream produces hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed. Hydrocarbon stream includes hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4. Hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4 include but are not limited to butanes pentanes hexanes heptanes and octanes. In certain embodiments hydrocarbons produced from alkylation unit have an octane number greater than 70 greater than 80 or greater than 90. In some embodiments hydrocarbon stream is suitable for use as gasoline without further processing.

In some embodiments bottoms stream may be hydrocracked to produce naphtha and or other products. The resulting naphtha may however need reformation to alter the octane level so that the product may be sold commercially as gasoline. Alternatively bottoms stream may be treated in a catalytic cracker to produce naphtha and or feed for an alkylation unit. In some embodiments naphtha stream kerosene stream and diesel stream have an imbalance of paraffinic hydrocarbons olefinic hydrocarbons and or aromatic hydrocarbons. The streams may not have a suitable quantity of olefins and or aromatics for use in commercial products. This imbalance may be changed by combining at least a portion of the streams to form combined stream which has a boiling range distribution from about 38 C. to about 343 C. Catalytically cracking combined stream may produce olefins and or other streams suitable for use in an alkylation unit and or other processing units. In some embodiments naphtha stream is hydrocracked to produce olefins.

In combined stream and bottoms stream from fractionation unit enters catalytic cracking unit . Under controlled cracking conditions for example controlled temperatures and pressures catalytic cracking unit produces additional C Chydrocarbon stream gasoline hydrocarbons stream and additional kerosene stream .

Additional C Chydrocarbon stream may be sent to alkylation unit combined with C Chydrocarbon stream and or combined with hydrocarbon gas stream to produce gasoline suitable for commercial sale. In some embodiments the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed.

In some embodiments an amount of the produced bottoms stream for example VGO is too low to sustain operation of a hydrocracking unit or catalytic cracking unit and the concentration of olefins in the produced gas streams from a fractionation unit and or a catalytic cracking unit for example from fractionation unit and or from catalytic cracking unit in may be too low to sustain operation of an alkylation unit. The naphtha produced from the fractionation unit may be treated to produce olefins for further processing in for example an alkylation unit. Reformulated gasoline produced by conventional naphtha reforming processes may not meet commercial specifications such as for example California Air Resources Board mandates when liquid stream produced from an in situ heat treatment process liquid is used as a feed stream. An amount of olefins in the naphtha may be saturated during conventional hydrotreating prior to the reforming naphtha process. Thus reforming of all the hydrotreated naphtha may result in a higher than desired aromatics content in the gasoline pool for reformulated gasoline. The imbalance in the olefin and aromatic content in the reformed naphtha may be changed by producing sufficient alkylate from an alkylation unit to produce reformulated gasoline. Olefins for example propylene and butylenes generated from fractionation and or cracking of the naphtha may be combined with isobutane to produce gasoline. In addition it has been found that catalytically cracking the naphtha and or other fractionated streams produced in a fractionating unit requires additional heat because of a reduced amount of coke production relative to other feedstocks used in catalytic cracking units.

In catalytic cracking system liquid stream is contacted with a catalytic cracking catalyst to produce one or more crude products. The catalytic cracking catalyst includes a selected catalytic cracking catalyst at least a portion of used regenerated cracking catalyst stream at least a portion of a regenerated cracking catalyst stream or a mixture thereof. Used regenerated cracking catalyst includes a regenerated cracking catalyst that has been used in second catalytic cracking system . Second catalytic cracking system may be used to crack hydrocarbons to produce olefins and or other crude products. Hydrocarbons provided to second catalytic cracking system may include C Chydrocarbons produced from the production wells gasoline hydrocarbons hydrowax hydrocarbons produced from Fischer Tropsch processes biofuels or combinations thereof. The use of a mixture of different types of hydrocarbon feed to the second catalytic cracking system may enhance C Colefin production to meet the alkylate demand. Thus integration of the products with refinery processes may be enhanced. Second catalytic cracking system may be a dense phase unit a fixed fluidized bed unit a riser a combination of the above mentioned units or any unit or configuration of units known in the art for cracking hydrocarbons.

Contact of the catalytic cracking catalyst and the liquid stream in catalytic cracking system produces a crude product and spent cracking catalyst. The crude product may include but is not limited to hydrocarbons having a boiling point distribution that is less than the boiling point distribution of liquid stream a portion of liquid stream or mixtures thereof. The crude product and spent catalyst enters separation system . Separation system may include for example a distillation unit a stripper a filtration system a centrifuge or any device known in the art capable of separating the crude product from the spent catalyst.

Separated spent cracking catalyst stream exits separation system and enters regeneration unit . In regeneration unit spent cracking catalyst is contacted with oxygen source for example oxygen and or air under carbon burning conditions to produce regenerated cracking catalyst stream and combustion gases . Combustion gases may form as a by product of the removal of carbon and or other impurities formed on the catalyst during the catalytic cracking process.

The temperature in regeneration unit may range from about 621 C. to about 760 C. or from about 677 C. to about 715 C. The pressure in regeneration unit may range from atmospheric to about 0.345 MPa or from about 0.034 to about 0.345 MPa. The residence time of the separated spent cracking catalyst in regeneration unit ranges from about 1 to about 6 minutes or from or about 2 to about 4 minutes. The coke content on the regenerated cracking catalyst is less than the coke content on the separated spent cracking catalyst. Such coke content is less than 0.5 by weight with the weight percent being based on the weight of the regenerated cracking catalyst excluding the weight of the coke content. The coke content of the regenerated cracking catalyst may range from 0.01 by weight to 0.5 by weight 0.05 by weight to 0.3 by weight or 0.1 by weight to 0.2 by weight.

In some embodiments regenerated cracking catalyst stream may be divided into two streams with at least a portion of regenerated cracking catalyst stream exiting regeneration unit and entering second catalytic cracking system . At least another portion of regenerated cracking catalyst stream exits regenerator and enters catalytic cracking system . The relative amount of the used regenerated cracking catalyst to the regenerated cracking catalyst is adjusted to provide for the desired cracking conditions within catalytic cracking system . Adjusting the ratio of used regenerated cracking catalyst to regenerated cracking catalyst may assist in the control of the cracking conditions in catalytic cracking system . A weight ratio of the used regenerated cracking catalyst to the regenerated cracking catalyst may range from 0.1 1 to 100 1 from 0.5 1 to 20 1 or from 1 1 to 10 1. For a system operated at steady state the weight ratio of used regenerated cracking catalyst to regenerated cracking catalyst approximates the weight ratio of the at least a portion of regenerated cracking catalyst passing to the second catalytic cracking system to the remaining portion of regenerated cracking catalyst that is mixed with liquid stream introduced into catalytic cracking system and thus the aforementioned ranges are also applicable to such weight ratio.

Crude product exits separation system and enters liquid separation unit . Liquid separation unit may be any system known to those skilled in the art for recovering and separating the crude product into product streams such as for example gas stream gasoline hydrocarbons stream cycle oil stream and bottom stream . In some embodiments bottom stream is recycled to catalytic cracking system . Liquid separation unit may include components and or units such as for example absorbers and strippers fractionators compressors and separators or any combination of known systems for providing recovery and separation of products from the crude product. In some embodiments at least a portion of light cycle oil stream exits liquid separation unit and enters second catalytic cracking system . In some embodiments none of the light cycle oil stream is sent to the second catalytic cracking system. In some embodiments at least a portion of gasoline hydrocarbons stream exits liquid separation unit and enters second catalytic cracking system . In some embodiments none of the gasoline hydrocarbons stream is sent to the second catalytic cracking system. In some embodiments gasoline hydrocarbons stream is suitable for sale and or for use in other processes.

At least a portion of gas oil hydrocarbon stream for example vacuum gas oil and or portions of gasoline hydrocarbons stream and at least a portion of light cycle oil stream are sent to catalytic cracking system . The streams are catalytically cracked in the presence of steam to produce crude olefin stream . Crude olefin stream may include hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2. In some embodiments crude olefin stream contains at least 30 by weight C Colefins at least 40 by weight C Colefins at least 50 by weight C Colefins at least 70 by weight C Colefins or at least 90 by weight C Colefins. Recycling the gasoline hydrocarbons stream into second catalytic cracking system may provide for an additional conversion across the overall process system of gas oil hydrocarbon stream to C Colefins.

In some embodiments second catalytic cracking system includes an intermediate reaction zone and a stripping zone that are in fluid communication with each other with the stripping zone located below the intermediate reaction zone. To provide for a high steam velocity within the stripping zone as compared to the velocity within the intermediate reaction zone the cross sectional area of the stripping zone is less than the cross sectional area of the intermediate reaction zone. The ratio of the stripping zone cross sectional area to the intermediate reaction zone cross sectional area may range from 0.1 1 to 0.9 1 from 0.2 1 to 0.8 1 or from 0.3 1 to 0.7 1.

In some embodiments the geometry of the second catalytic cracking system is such that it is generally cylindrical. The length to diameter ratio of the stripping zone of the catalytic cracking system provides for the desired high steam velocity within the stripping zone and provides enough contact time within the stripping zone for the desired stripping of the used regenerated catalyst that is to be removed from the second catalytic cracking system. Thus the length to diameter ratio of the stripping zone may range of from 1 1 to 25 1 from 2 1 to 15 1 or from 3 1 to 10 1.

In some embodiments second catalytic cracking system is operated or controlled independently from the operation or control of catalytic cracking system . Independent operation or control of second catalytic cracking system may improve overall conversion of the gasoline hydrocarbons into the desired products such as ethylene propylene and butylenes. With independent operation of second catalytic cracking system the severity of catalytic cracking unit may be reduced to optimize the yield of C Colefins. A temperature in second catalytic cracking system may range from about 482 C. 900 F. to about 871 C. 1600 F. from about 510 C. 950 F. to about 871 C. 1600 F. or from about 538 C. 1000 F. to about 732 C. 1350 F. . The operating pressure of second catalytic cracking system may range from atmospheric to about 0.345 MPa 50 psig or from about 0.034 to 0.345 MPa 5 to 50 psig .

Addition of steam into second catalytic cracking system may assist in the operational control of the second catalytic cracking unit. In some embodiments steam is not necessary. In some embodiments the use of the steam for a given gasoline hydrocarbon conversion across the process system and in the cracking of the gasoline hydrocarbons may provide for an improved selectivity toward C Colefin yield with an increase in propylene and butylenes yield relative to other catalytic cracking processes. A weight ratio of steam to gasoline hydrocarbons introduced into second catalytic cracking system may be up to or about 15 1 from 0.1 1 to 10 1 from 0.2 1 to 9 1 or from 0.5 1 to 8 1.

Crude olefin stream enters olefin separation system . Olefin separation system can be any system known to those skilled in the art for recovering and separating the crude olefin stream into C Colefin product streams for example ethylene product stream propylene product stream and butylenes products stream . Olefin separation system may include such systems as absorbers and strippers fractionators compressors and separators or any combination of known systems or equipment providing for the recovery and separation of C Colefin products from fluid stream . In some embodiments olefin streams enter alkylation unit to generate hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments hydrocarbon stream has an octane number of at least 70 at least 80 or at least 90. In some embodiments all or portions of one or more of streams are transported to other processing units such as polymerization units for use as feedstocks.

In some embodiments the crude product from the catalytic cracking system and the crude olefin stream from second catalytic cracking system may be combined. The combined stream may enter a single separation unit for example a combination of liquid separation system and olefin separation system .

In used cracking catalyst stream exits second catalytic cracking system and enters catalytic cracking system . Catalyst in used cracking catalyst stream may include a slightly higher concentration of carbon than the concentration of carbon that is on the catalyst in regenerated cracking catalyst . A high concentration of carbon on the catalyst may partially deactivate the catalytic cracking catalysts which provides for an enhanced yield of olefins from the catalytic cracking system . Coke content of the used regenerated catalyst may be at least 0.1 by weight or at least 0.5 by weight. The coke content of the used regenerated catalyst may range from about 0.1 by weight to about 1 by weight or from about 0.1 by weight to about 0.6 by weight.

The catalytic cracking catalyst used in catalytic cracking system and second catalytic cracking system may be any fluidizable cracking catalyst known in the art. The fluidizable cracking catalyst may include a molecular sieve having cracking activity dispersed in a porous inorganic refractory oxide matrix or binder. Molecular sieve refers to any material capable of separating atoms or molecules based on their respective dimensions. Molecular sieves suitable for use as a component of the cracking catalyst include pillared clays delaminated clays and crystalline aluminosilicates. In some embodiments the cracking catalyst contains a crystalline aluminosilicate. Examples of such aluminosilicates include Y zeolites ultrastable Y zeolites X zeolites zeolite beta zeolite L offretite mordenite faujasite and zeolite omega. In some embodiments crystalline aluminosilicates for use in the cracking catalyst are X and or Y zeolites. U.S. Pat. No. 3 130 007 to Breck describes Y type zeolites.

The stability and or acidity of a zeolite used as a component of the cracking catalyst may be increased by exchanging the zeolite with hydrogen ions ammonium ions polyvalent metal cations such as rare earth containing cations magnesium cations or calcium cations or a combination of hydrogen ions ammonium ions and polyvalent metal cations. The sodium content may be lowered until it is at most 0.8 by weight at most 0.5 by weight and at most 0.3 by weight calculated as NaO. Methods of carrying out the ion exchange are well known in the art.

The zeolite or other molecular sieve component of the cracking catalyst is combined with a porous inorganic refractory oxide matrix or binder to form a finished catalyst prior to use. The refractory oxide component in the finished catalyst may be silica alumina silica alumina natural or synthetic clays pillared or delaminated clays mixtures of one or more of these components and the like. In some embodiments the inorganic refractory oxide matrix includes a mixture of silica alumina and a clay such as kaolin hectorite sepiolite and attapulgite. A finished catalyst may contain between about 5 by weight and about 40 by weight zeolite or other molecular sieve and greater than about 20 weight percent inorganic refractory oxide. In some embodiments the finished catalyst may contain between about 10 and about 35 by weight zeolite or other molecular sieve between about 10 and about 30 by weight inorganic refractory oxide and between about 30 and about 70 by weight clay.

The crystalline aluminosilicate or other molecular sieve component of the cracking catalyst may be combined with the porous inorganic refractory oxide component or a precursor thereof by any suitable technique known in the art including mixing mulling blending or homogenization. Examples of precursors that may be used include but are not limited to alumina alumina sols silica sols zirconia alumina hydrogels polyoxycations of aluminum and zirconium and peptized alumina. In some embodiments the zeolite is combined with an alumino silicate gel or sol or other inorganic refractory oxide component and the resultant mixture is spray dried to produce finished catalyst particles normally ranging in diameter between about 40 micrometers and about 80 micrometers. In some embodiments the zeolite or other molecular sieve may be mulled or otherwise mixed with the refractory oxide component or precursor thereof extruded and then ground into the desired particle size range. The finished catalyst may have an average bulk density between about 0.30 and about 0.90 gram per cubic centimeter and a pore volume between about 0.10 and about 0.90 cubic centimeter per gram.

In some embodiments a ZSM 5 additive may be introduced into the intermediate cracking reactor of second catalytic cracking system . When a ZSM 5 additive is used along with the selected cracking catalyst in the intermediate cracking reactor a yield of the lower olefins such as propylene and butylenes is enhanced. An amount of ZSM 5 ranges from at most 30 by weight at most 20 by weight or at most 18 by weight of the regenerated catalyst being introduced into second catalytic cracking system . An amount of ZSM 5 additive is introduced into second catalytic cracking system may range from 1 to 30 by weight 3 to 20 by weight or 5 to 18 by weight of the regenerated cracking catalyst being introduced into second catalytic cracking system .

The ZSM 5 additive is a molecular sieve additive selected from the family of medium pore size crystalline aluminosilicates or zeolites. Molecular sieves that can be used as the ZSM 5 additive include but are not limited to medium pore zeolites as described in Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types Eds. W. H. Meier and D. H. Olson Butterworth Heineman Third Edition 1992. The medium pore size zeolites generally have a pore size from about 0.5 nm to about 0.7 nm and include for example MFI MFS MEL MTW EUO MTT HEU FER and TON structure type zeolites IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature . Non limiting examples of such medium pore size zeolites including ZSM 5 ZSM 12 ZSM 22 ZSM 23 ZSM 34 ZSM 35 ZSM 38 ZSM 48 ZSM 50 silicalite and silicalite . ZSM 5 are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 702 886 to Argauer et al. and 3 770 614 to Graven both of which are incorporated by reference herein.

ZSM 11 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 709 979 to Chu ZSM 12 in U.S. Pat. No. 3 832 449 to Rosinski et al. ZSM 21 and ZSM 38 in U.S. Pat. No. 3 948 758 to Bonacci et al. ZSM 23 in U.S. Pat. No. 4 076 842 to Plank et al. and ZSM 35 in U.S. Pat. No. 4 016 245 to Plank et al. all of which are incorporated by reference herein.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 368 114 to Chester et al. which is incorporated by reference herein describes in detail the class of zeolites that can be suitable ZSM 5 additives. The ZSM 5 additive may be held together with a catalytically inactive inorganic oxide matrix component in accordance with conventional methods.

In some embodiments residue produced from units described in may be used as an energy source. The residue may be gasified to produce gases which are burned for example burned in a turbine and or injected into a subsurface formation for example injection of produced carbon dioxide into a subsurface formation . In certain embodiments the residue is de asphalted to produce asphalt. The asphalt may be gasified.

During some in situ heat treatment processes ammonia may be in formation fluid produced from the formation. Produced ammonia may be used for a number of purposes. In some embodiments the ammonia or a portion of the ammonia may be used to produce hydrogen. In some embodiments the Haber Bosch process may be used to produce hydrogen Ammonia may produce hydrogen and nitrogen according to the following equilibrium reaction N 3H 2NH 1 

The reaction may be a high temperature high pressure catalyzed reaction. The temperature may be from about 300 C. to about 800 C. The pressure may be from about 80 bars to about 220 bars. The catalyst may be composed substantially of iron. The total amount of hydrogen produced may be increased by shifting the equilibrium towards hydrogen and nitrogen production. Equilibrium may be shifted to produce more nitrogen and hydrogen by removing nitrogen and or hydrogen as they are produced.

Many wells are needed for treating a hydrocarbon formation using an in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments vertical or substantially vertical wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments horizontal or U shaped wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments combinations of horizontal and vertical wells are formed in the formation. Wells may be formed using drilling rigs.

In an embodiment a rig for drilling wells includes equipment on the rig for drilling multiple wellbores simultaneously. The rig may include one or more systems for constructing the wells including drilling fluid handling and cementing of the wells through the overburden drilling to total depth and placing completion equipment such as heaters and casing. The rig may be particularly useful for forming closely spaced wells such as freeze wells.

In some embodiments a rig for drilling wellbores for an in situ heat treatment process may be a movable platform. The working surface of the platform may be 20 m or more above the ground. Piping may be suspended from the bottom of the platform before being deployed.

In some embodiments wells are drilled in sequential stages with different drilling machines. The wells may be barrier wells heater wells production wells production heater wells monitor wells injection wells or other types of wells. A conductor drilling machine may set the conductor of the well. A main hole drilling machine may drill the wellbore to depth. A completion drilling machine may place casing cement tubing cables heaters and perform other well completion tasks. The drilling machines may be on the same location moving 3 to 10 meters between wells for 2 to 3 years. The size and the shape of the drilling machines may not have to meet existing road transportation regulations since once in the field the drilling machines may remain there for the duration of the project. The major components of the drilling machines may be transported to location and assembled there. The drilling machines may not have to be disassembled for a multi mile move for several years.

One or more central plants may support the drilling machines. The use of a central plant may allow for smaller drilling machines. The central plant may include prime movers mud tanks solids handling equipment pipe handling power and other equipment common to the drilling machines. The equipment of the central plant may be coupled to the drilling machines by flexible umbilicals by easily modifiable piping and or by quick release electrical connections. Several wells may be drilled before the need to move the central plant arises. In some embodiments the central plant may be moved while connected to one or more operating drilling machines. The drilling machines and central plant may be designed with integrated drip pans to capture leaks and spills.

In some embodiments the drilling machines are powered directly off the electric grid. In other embodiments the drilling machines are diesel powered. Using diesel power may avoid complications associated with interfering with the installation of electrical and other systems needed for the wells of the in situ heat treatment process.

The drilling machines may be automated so that little or no human interaction is required. The tubulars used by the drilling machines may be stacked and stored on or by the drilling machines so that the drilling machines can access and manipulate the tubulars with minimal or no human intervention. For example a carousel or other device may be used to store a tubular and move the tubular from storage to the drilling mast. The carousel or other device may also be used to move the tubular from the drilling mast to storage.

The drilling machines may include propulsion units so that the drilling machines do not need to be skidded. The central plant may also include propulsion units. Skidding involves extra equipment not used for drilling the wells and may be complicated by the dense concentration of surface facilities and equipment. In some embodiments the drilling machines and or central plant may include tracks or a walking mechanism to eliminate railroad type tracks. Eliminating railroad type tracks may reduce the amount of pre work road and rail formation that needs to be completed before drilling operations can begin. In some embodiments the propulsion units may include a fixed movement mechanism. The fixed movement mechanism may advance the drilling machine a set distance when activated so that the drilling machine is located at the next well location. Fine adjustment may allow for exact positioning of the drilling machine after initial position location by the fixed movement mechanism. In some embodiments laser guidance systems may be utilized to position the drilling machines. The laser guidance systems may ensure that the wellbores being formed are started at the right location in the well pattern. In some embodiments drilling machines and or the central plant are positioned on a central track or access lane. The drilling equipment may be extended from one side to the other of the central track to form the wells. The drilling machine is able to stay in one place while an arm or cantilever mechanism allows multiples of wells to be drilled around the drilling machine. The wells may be drilled in very close proximity if required.

The drilling machines and the central plant may be self leveling and able to function on up to a 10 grade or higher. In some embodiments the drilling machines include hydraulic and or mechanical leveling systems. The drilling machines and central plant may have ground clearances of at least 1 meter so that the units may be moved unobstructed over wellheads. Each drilling machine may include a mechanism for precisely placing the working components of the drilling machine over the hole center of the well being formed. In some embodiments the mechanism adjusts the position of a derrick of the drilling machine.

The drilling machines may be moved from one well to another with derricks of the drilling machines in upright or inclined positions. The term derrick is used to represent whatever top drive support device is employed on the rig whether the top drive support device is a derrick stiff mast or hydraulic arm. Because some drilling machines may use three 10 m pipe sections the derrick may have to be lowered for rig moves. If the derrick must be lowered lowering and raising the derrick needs to be a quick and safe operation. In some embodiments the derrick is lowered with the bottom hole assembly racked in the derrick to save time handling the bottom hole assembly. In other embodiments the bottom hole assembly is separated from the derrick for servicing during a move of the drilling machine.

In some embodiments one of the drilling machines is able to do more than one stage of well formation. In some embodiments a freeze wall or other barrier is formed around all or a portion of a treatment area. There may be about a year or more of time from when the last freeze well is drilled to the time that main holes for heater and producer wells can be drilled. In the intervening time the drilling machine used to drill the main hole of a well may be used to preset conductors for heater wells and or production wells in the treatment area.

In some embodiments two or more drilling machines are placed on the same carrier. For example the carrier may include equipment that presets the conductor for a well. The carrier may also carry equipment for forming the main hole. One portion of the machine could be presetting a conductor while another portion of the machine could be simultaneously forming the main hole of a second well.

Running drill pipe to replace bits running in down hole equipment and pulling the equipment out after use may be time consuming and expensive. To save time and expense all drilling and completion tools may go into the hole and not come out. For example drill pipe may become casing. Once data is obtained from logging runs the logging tools are left in the hole and drilling proceeds through them or past them if necessary. Downhole equipment is integrated into the drill pipe. In some embodiments the drill pipe becomes a conduit of a conduit in conduit heater.

In some embodiments a retractable drilling assembly is used. Using a retractable drilling assembly may be beneficial when using continuous coiled tubing. When total depth of the well is reached the drill bit and bottom hole assembly may be retracted to a smaller diameter. The drill bit and bottom hole assembly may be brought to the surface through the coiled tubing. The coiled tubing may be left in the hole as casing.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine and the completion drilling machine include a quick connect device for attaching the fluid diverter spool drilling wellhead to the conductor casing. The use of a quick connect device may be faster than threading or welding the diverter to the conductor casing. The quick connect device may be a snap on or clamp on type diverter. Wellheads are typically designed to fit a multitude of casing configurations everything from 48 inch conductor to 2 inch tubing. For an in situ heat treatment process the wellheads may not need to span such a large casing diameter set or have multiple string requirements. The wellheads may only handle a very limited pipe diameter range and only one or two casing strings. Having a fit for purpose wellhead may significantly reduce the cost of fabricating and installing the wellheads for the wells of the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine includes a slickline boom system. The slickline boom system may allow running ranging equipment in a close offset well while drilling the well the drilling machine is positioned over. The use of the slickline boom system on the drilling machine may eliminate the need for additional equipment for employing the ranging equipment.

In some embodiments the conductor drilling machine is a blast hole rig. The blast hole rig may be mounted on a crawler or carrier with metal tracks. Air or gas compression is on board the blast hole rig. Tubulars may be racked horizontally on the blast hole rig. The derrick of the blast hole rig may be adjusted to hole center. The bottom hole drilling assembly of the blast hole rig may be left in the derrick when the blast hole rig is moved. In some embodiments the blast hole rig includes an integral drilling fluid tank solids control equipment and a mist collector. In some embodiments the drilling fluid tank the solids control equipment and or the mist collector is part of the central plant.

During well formation with jointed pipe one time consuming task is making connections. To reduce the number of connections needed during formation of wells long lengths of pipe may be used. In some embodiments the drilling machines are able to use pipe with a length of about 25 m to 30 m. The 25 m to 30 m piping may be made up of two or more shorter joints but is preferably a single joint of the appropriate length. Using a single joint may decrease the complexity of pipe handling and result in fewer potential leak paths in the drill string. In some embodiments the drilling machines use jointed pipe having other lengths such as 20 m lengths or 10 m lengths.

The drilling machine may use a top drive system. In some embodiments the top drive system functions using a rack and pinion. In some embodiments the top drive system functions using a hydraulic system.

The drilling machines may include automated pipe handling systems. The automated pipe handling system may be able to lift pipe make connections and have another joint in the raised position ready for the next connection. The automated pipe handling systems may include an iron roughneck to make and break connections. In some embodiments the pipe skid for the drilling machine is an integral component of the drilling machine.

String floats check valves may be needed in the drill string because air and or liquid will be used during drilling. An integral float valve may be positioned in each joint used by the drilling machine. Including a string float in each joint may minimize circulating times at connections and speed up the connection process.

Drilling the wells may be done at low operating pressures. In some embodiments a quick connect coupler is used to connect drill pipe together because of the low operating pressures. Using quick connect couplers to join drill pipe may reduce drilling time and simplify pipe handling automation.

In certain embodiments the main hole drilling machine is designed to drill 6 inch or 6 inch holes. The pumping capabilities needed to support the main hole drilling machine may include 3 900 scfm air compressors a 2000 psi booster and a liquid pump with an operational maximum of 325 gpm. A 35 gpm pump may also be included if mist drilling is required.

In some embodiments the main hole drilling machine and or the completion drilling machine uses coiled tubing. Coiled tubing may allow for minimal or no pipe connections above the bottom hole assembly. However the drilling machine still needs the ability to deploy and retrieve the individual components of the bottom hole assembly. In some embodiments components are automatically retrieved by a carousel deployed and made up over the hole when running in the hole. The process may be reversed when tripping out of the hole. Alternatively components may be racked horizontally on the drilling machine. The components may be maneuvered with automatic pipe arms.

The drilling machine may employ a split injector system. When coiled tubing operations are halted the two sides of the injector may be remotely unlatched and retracted to allow for over hole access.

In some embodiments that use coiled tubing a bottom hole assembly handling rig is used to make up and deploy the bottom hole assembly in the well conductor of a well to be drilled to total depth. The drilling machine may leave the current bottom hole assembly in the well after reaching total depth and prior to moving to the next well. After latching on to the bottom hole assembly in the follow up well the bottom hole assembly handling rig may pull the bottom hole assembly from the previous well and prepare it for the next well in sequence. The mast for the bottom hole assembly handling rig may be a very simple arrangement supporting a sandline for bottom hole assembly handling. In some embodiments the wellbore in which the coiled tubing is placed is formed by jet drilling.

In some embodiments coiled tubing may be carbon steel. Carbon steel coiled tubing may be used for only a limited number of cycles because coiling and or uncoiling the steel forces the coiled tubing past the elastic region of the stress strain curve and into the plastic region. In the plastic region the steel is permanently deformed and or weakened. For some coiled tubing uses the coiled tubing is placed in the formation and left in the formation so the use of carbon steel coiled tubing does not present a problem. For some coiled tubing uses the coiled tubing may be coiled and uncoiled many times. For coiled tubing that needs to be coiled and uncoiled many times the coiled tubing may be composite coiled tubing. Composite coiled tubing may stay in the elastic region during coiling and uncoiling so that there is little or no permanent deformation of the coiled tubing during deployment and retrieval. Composite coiled tubing is available from Fiberspar LinePipe LLC Houston Tex. U.S.A. . In some embodiments composite coiled tubing may include one or more electrical wires in the composite. The electrical wires may be coupled to equipment and lowered into the wellbore with the coiled tubing.

Coiled tubing may be stored on a reel before deployment. A reel used by the drilling machine may have 500 1000 m of pipe. To increase the number of cycles the coiled tubing may be used the reel may have a large diameter and be relatively narrow. In some embodiments the coiled tubing reel is the wellhead. Having the wellhead and the reel as one unit eliminates the additional handling of a separate wellhead and an empty reel.

Reverse circulation drilling enables fast penetration rates and the use of low density drilling fluid such as air or mist. When tri cone rock bits are used a skirted rock bit assembly replaces the conventional tri cone bit. The skirt directs the drilling fluid from the pipe in pipe drill rod annulus to the outside portion of the hole being drilled. As the cuttings are generated by the action of the rotating drill bit the cuttings mix with the drilling fluid pass through a hole in the center of the bit and are carried out of the hole through the center of the drill rods. When a non skirted drill bit is used a reverse circulation crossover is installed between the standard bit and the drill rods. The crossover redirects the drilling fluid from the pipe in pipe drill rod annulus to the inside of the drill string about a meter above the bit. The drilling fluid passes through the bit jets mixes with the cuttings and returns up the drill string. At the crossover the fluid cuttings mixture enters the drill string and continues to the surface inside the inner tube of the drill rod.

In some embodiments the cuttings generated during drilling are milled and used as a filler material in a slurry used for forming a grout wall. Cuttings that contain hydrocarbon material may be retorted to extract the hydrocarbons. Retorting the cuttings may be environmentally beneficial because the reinjected cuttings are free of organic material. Recovering the hydrocarbons may offset a portion of the milling cost.

During some in situ heat treatment processes wellbores may need to be formed in heated formations. Wellbores drilled into hot formation may be additional or replacement heater wells additional or replacement production wells and or monitor wells. In some in situ heat treatment processes a barrier formed around all or a portion of the in situ heat treatment process is formed by freeze wells that form a low temperature zone around the freeze wells. A portion of the cooling capacity of the freeze well equipment may be utilized to cool the equipment needed to drill into the hot formation. Drilling bits may be advanced slowly in hot sections to ensure that the formed wellbore cools sufficiently to preclude drilling problems.

In some embodiments one or more portions of a wellbore may need to be isolated from other portions of the wellbore to establish zonal isolation. In some embodiments an expandable may be positioned in the wellbore adjacent to a section of the wellbore that is to be isolated. A pig or hydraulic pressure may be used to enlarge the expandable to establish zonal isolation.

In some embodiments pathways may be formed in the formation after the wellbores are formed. Pathways may be formed adjacent to heater wellbores and or adjacent to production wellbores. The pathways may promote better fluid flow and or better heat conduction. In some embodiments pathways are formed by hydraulically fracturing the formation. Other fracturing techniques may also be used. In some embodiments small diameter bores may be formed in the formation. In some embodiments heating the formation may expand and close or substantially close the fractures or bores formed in the formation to enhance heat conduction.

Some wellbores formed in the formation may be used to facilitate formation of a perimeter barrier around a treatment area. Heat sources in the treatment area may heat hydrocarbons in the formation within the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be but is not limited to a low temperature or frozen barrier formed by freeze wells dewatering wells a grout wall formed in the formation a sulfur cement barrier a barrier formed by a gel produced in the formation a barrier formed by precipitation of salts in the formation a barrier formed by a polymerization reaction in the formation and or sheets driven into the formation. Heat sources production wells injection wells dewatering wells and or monitoring wells may be installed in the treatment area defined by the barrier prior to simultaneously with or after installation of the barrier.

A low temperature zone around at least a portion of a treatment area may be formed by freeze wells. In an embodiment refrigerant is circulated through freeze wells to form low temperature zones around each freeze well. The freeze wells are placed in the formation so that the low temperature zones overlap and form a low temperature zone around the treatment area. The low temperature zone established by freeze wells is maintained below the freezing temperature of aqueous fluid in the formation. Aqueous fluid entering the low temperature zone freezes and forms the frozen barrier. In other embodiments the freeze barrier is formed by batch operated freeze wells. A cold fluid such as liquid nitrogen is introduced into the freeze wells to form low temperature zones around the freeze wells. The fluid is replenished as needed.

In some embodiments two or more rows of freeze wells are located about all or a portion of the perimeter of the treatment area to form a thick interconnected low temperature zone. Thick low temperature zones may be formed adjacent to areas in the formation where there is a high flow rate of aqueous fluid in the formation. The thick barrier may ensure that breakthrough of the frozen barrier established by the freeze wells does not occur.

In some embodiments a double barrier system is used to isolate a treatment area. The double barrier system may be formed with a first barrier and a second barrier. The first barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the treatment area to inhibit fluid from entering or exiting the treatment area. The second barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the first barrier to isolate an inter barrier zone between the first barrier and the second barrier. The inter barrier zone may have a thickness from about 1 m to about 300 m. In some embodiments the thickness of the inter barrier zone is from about 10 m to about 100 m or from about 20 m to about 50 m.

The double barrier system may allow greater project depths than a single barrier system. Greater depths are possible with the double barrier system because the stepped differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier is less than the differential pressure across a single barrier. The smaller differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier make a breach of the double barrier system less likely to occur at depth for the double barrier system as compared to the single barrier system.

The double barrier system reduces the probability that a barrier breach will affect the treatment area or the formation on the outside of the double barrier. That is the probability that the location and or time of occurrence of the breach in the first barrier will coincide with the location and or time of occurrence of the breach in the second barrier is low especially if the distance between the first barrier and the second barrier is relatively large for example greater than about 15 m . Having a double barrier may reduce or eliminate influx of fluid into the treatment area following a breach of the first barrier or the second barrier. The treatment area may not be affected if the second barrier breaches. If the first barrier breaches only a portion of the fluid in the inter barrier zone is able to enter the contained zone. Also fluid from the contained zone will not pass the second barrier. Recovery from a breach of a barrier of the double barrier system may require less time and fewer resources than recovery from a breach of a single barrier system. For example reheating a treatment area zone following a breach of a double barrier system may require less energy than reheating a similarly sized treatment area zone following a breach of a single barrier system.

The first barrier and the second barrier may be the same type of barrier or different types of barriers. In some embodiments the first barrier and the second barrier are formed by freeze wells. In some embodiments the first barrier is formed by freeze wells and the second barrier is a grout wall. The grout wall may be formed of cement sulfur sulfur cement or combinations thereof. In some embodiments a portion of the first barrier and or a portion of the second barrier is a natural barrier such as an impermeable rock formation.

Vertically positioned freeze wells and or horizontally positioned freeze wells may be positioned around sides of the treatment area. If the upper layer the overburden or the lower layer the underburden of the formation is likely to allow fluid flow into the treatment area or out of the treatment area horizontally positioned freeze wells may be used to form an upper and or a lower barrier for the treatment area. In some embodiments an upper barrier and or a lower barrier may not be necessary if the upper layer and or the lower layer are at least substantially impermeable. If the upper freeze barrier is formed portions of heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells that pass through the low temperature zone created by the freeze wells forming the upper freeze barrier wells may be insulated and or heat traced so that the low temperature zone does not adversely affect the functioning of the heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells passing through the low temperature zone.

Spacing between adjacent freeze wells may be a function of a number of different factors. The factors may include but are not limited to physical properties of formation material type of refrigeration system coldness and thermal properties of the refrigerant flow rate of material into or out of the treatment area time for forming the low temperature zone and economic considerations. Consolidated or partially consolidated formation material may allow for a large separation distance between freeze wells. A separation distance between freeze wells in consolidated or partially consolidated formation material may be from about 3 m to about 20 m about 4 m to about 15 m or about 5 m to about 10 m. In an embodiment the spacing between adjacent freeze wells is about 5 m. Spacing between freeze wells in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material such as in tar sand may need to be smaller than spacing in consolidated formation material. A separation distance between freeze wells in unconsolidated material may be from about 1 m to about 5 m.

Freeze wells may be placed in the formation so that there is minimal deviation in orientation of one freeze well relative to an adjacent freeze well. Excessive deviation may create a large separation distance between adjacent freeze wells that may not permit formation of an interconnected low temperature zone between the adjacent freeze wells. Factors that influence the manner in which freeze wells are inserted into the ground include but are not limited to freeze well insertion time depth that the freeze wells are to be inserted formation properties desired well orientation and economics.

Relatively low depth wellbores for freeze wells may be impacted and or vibrationally inserted into some formations. Wellbores for freeze wells may be impacted and or vibrationally inserted into formations to depths from about 1 m to about 100 m without excessive deviation in orientation of freeze wells relative to adjacent freeze wells in some types of formations.

Wellbores for freeze wells placed deep in the formation or wellbores for freeze wells placed in formations with layers that are difficult to impact or vibrate a well through may be placed in the formation by directional drilling and or geosteering. Acoustic signals electrical signals magnetic signals and or other signals produced in a first wellbore may be used to guide directionally drilling of adjacent wellbores so that desired spacing between adjacent wells is maintained. Tight control of the spacing between wellbores for freeze wells is an important factor in minimizing the time for completion of barrier formation.

In some embodiments one or more portions of freeze wells may be angled in the formation. The freeze wells may be angled in the formation adjacent to aquifers. In some embodiments the angled portions are angled outwards from the treatment area. In some embodiments the angled portions may be angled inwards towards the treatment area. The angled portions of the freeze wells allow extra length of freeze well to be positioned in the aquifer zones. Also the angled portions of the freeze wells may reduce the shear load applied to the frozen barrier by water flowing in the aquifer.

After formation of the wellbore for the freeze well the wellbore may be backflushed with water adjacent to the part of the formation that is to be reduced in temperature to form a portion of the freeze barrier. The water may displace drilling fluid remaining in the wellbore. The water may displace indigenous gas in cavities adjacent to the formation. In some embodiments the wellbore is filled with water from a conduit up to the level of the overburden. In some embodiments the wellbore is backflushed with water in sections. The wellbore maybe treated in sections having lengths of about 6 m 10 m 14 m 17 m or greater. Pressure of the water in the wellbore is maintained below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments the water or a portion of the water is removed from the wellbore and a freeze well is placed in the formation.

Formation refrigerant may flow through cold side conduit from a refrigeration unit to inlet conduit of freeze well . The formation refrigerant may flow through an annular space between inlet conduit and canister to warm side conduit . Heat may transfer from the formation to canister and from the canister to the formation refrigerant in the annular space. Inlet conduit may be insulated to inhibit heat transfer to the formation refrigerant during passage of the formation refrigerant into freeze well . In an embodiment inlet conduit is a high density polyethylene tube. At cold temperatures some polymers may exhibit a large amount of thermal contraction. For example a 260 m initial length of polyethylene conduit subjected to a temperature of about 25 C. may contract by 6 m or more. If a high density polyethylene conduit or other polymer conduit is used the large thermal contraction of the material must be taken into account in determining the final depth of the freeze well. For example the freeze well may be drilled deeper than needed and the conduit may be allowed to shrink back during use. In some embodiments inlet conduit is an insulated metal tube. In some embodiments the insulation may be a polymer coating such as but not limited to polyvinylchloride high density polyethylene and or polystyrene.

Freeze well may be introduced into the formation using a coiled tubing rig. In an embodiment canister and inlet conduit are wound on a single reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces the canister and inlet conduit into the formation. In an embodiment canister is wound on a first reel and inlet conduit is wound on a second reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces canister into the formation. Then the coiled tubing rig is used to introduce inlet conduit into the canister. In other embodiments freeze well is assembled in sections at the wellbore site and introduced into the formation.

An insulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to overburden . An uninsulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to layer or layers where a low temperature zone is to be formed. In some embodiments uninsulated sections of the freeze wells may be positioned adjacent only to aquifers or other permeable portions of the formation that would allow fluid to flow into or out of the treatment area. Portions of the formation where uninsulated sections of the freeze wells are to be placed may be determined using analysis of cores and or logging techniques.

Various types of refrigeration systems may be used to form a low temperature zone. Determination of an appropriate refrigeration system may be based on many factors including but not limited to a type of freeze well a distance between adjacent freeze wells a refrigerant a time frame in which to form a low temperature zone a depth of the low temperature zone a temperature differential to which the refrigerant will be subjected one or more chemical and or physical properties of the refrigerant one or more environmental concerns related to potential refrigerant releases leaks or spills one or more economic factors water flow rate in the formation composition and or properties of formation water including the salinity of the formation water and one or more properties of the formation such as thermal conductivity thermal diffusivity and heat capacity.

A circulated fluid refrigeration system may utilize a liquid refrigerant formation refrigerant that is circulated through freeze wells. Some of the desired properties for the formation refrigerant are low working temperature low viscosity at and near the working temperature high density high specific heat capacity high thermal conductivity low cost low corrosiveness and low toxicity. A low working temperature of the formation refrigerant allows a large low temperature zone to be established around a freeze well. The low working temperature of formation refrigerant should be about 20 C. or lower. Formation refrigerants having low working temperatures of at least 60 C. may include aqua ammonia potassium formate solutions such as Dynalene HC 50 Dynalene Heat Transfer Fluids Whitehall Pa. U.S.A. or FREEZIUM Kemira Chemicals Helsinki Finland silicone heat transfer fluids such as Syltherm XLT Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. U.S.A. hydrocarbon refrigerants such as propylene and chlorofluorocarbons such as R 22. Aqua ammonia is a solution of ammonia and water with a weight percent of ammonia between about 20 and about 40 . Aqua ammonia has several properties and characteristics that make use of aqua ammonia as the formation refrigerant desirable. Such properties and characteristics include but are not limited to a very low freezing point a low viscosity ready availability and low cost.

Formation refrigerant that is capable of being chilled below a freezing temperature of aqueous formation fluid may be used to form the low temperature zone around the treatment area. The following equation the Sanger equation may be used to model the time tneeded to form a frozen barrier of radius R around a freeze well having a surface temperature of T 

EQN. 2 implies that a large low temperature zone may be formed by using a refrigerant having an initial temperature that is very low. The use of formation refrigerant having an initial cold temperature of about 30 C. or lower is desirable. Formation refrigerants having initial temperatures warmer than about 30 C. may also be used but such formation refrigerants require longer times for the low temperature zones produced by individual freeze wells to connect. In addition such formation refrigerants may require the use of closer freeze well spacings and or more freeze wells.

The physical properties of the material used to construct the freeze wells may be a factor in the determination of the coldest temperature of the formation refrigerant used to form the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Carbon steel may be used as a construction material of freeze wells. ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys and ASTM A333 grade 3 steel alloys may be used for low temperature applications. ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys typically contain little or no nickel and have a low working temperature limit of about 50 C. ASTM A333 grade 3 steel alloys typically contain nickel and have a much colder low working temperature limit. The nickel in the ASTM A333 grade 3 alloy adds ductility at cold temperatures but also significantly raises the cost of the metal. In some embodiments the coldest temperature of the refrigerant is from about 35 C. to about 55 C. from about 38 C. to about 47 C. or from about 40 C. to about 45 C. to allow for the use of ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloys for construction of canisters for freeze wells. Stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel may be used to form freeze wells but the cost of stainless steel is typically much more than the cost of ASTM A333 grade 6 steel alloy.

In some embodiments the metal used to form the canisters of the freeze wells may be provided as pipe. In some embodiments the metal used to form the canisters of the freeze wells may be provided in sheet form. The sheet metal may be longitudinally welded to form pipe and or coiled tubing. Forming the canisters from sheet metal may improve the economics of the system by allowing for coiled tubing insulation and by reducing the equipment and manpower needed to form and install the canisters using pipe.

A refrigeration unit may be used to reduce the temperature of formation refrigerant to the low working temperature. In some embodiments the refrigeration unit may utilize an ammonia vaporization cycle. Refrigeration units are available from Cool Man Inc. Milwaukee Wis. U.S.A. Gartner Refrigeration Manufacturing Minneapolis Minn. U.S.A. and other suppliers. In some embodiments a cascading refrigeration system may be utilized with a first stage of ammonia and a second stage of carbon dioxide. The circulating refrigerant through the freeze wells may be 30 by weight ammonia in water aqua ammonia . Alternatively a single stage carbon dioxide refrigeration system may be used.

In some embodiments refrigeration systems for forming a low temperature barrier for a treatment area may be installed and activated before freeze wells are formed in the formation. As the freeze well wellbores are formed freeze wells may be installed in the wellbores. Refrigerant may be circulated through the wellbores soon after the freeze well is installed into the wellbore. Limiting the time between wellbore formation and cooling initiation may limit or inhibit cross mixing of formation water between different aquifers.

Grout may be used in combination with freeze wells to provide a barrier for the in situ heat treatment process. The grout fills cavities vugs in the formation and reduces the permeability of the formation. Grout may have higher thermal conductivity than gas and or formation fluid that fills cavities in the formation. Placing grout in the cavities may allow for faster low temperature zone formation. The grout forms a perpetual barrier in the formation that may strengthen the formation. The use of grout in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material may allow for larger well spacing than is possible without the use of grout. The combination of grout and the low temperature zone formed by freeze wells may constitute a double barrier for environmental regulation purposes. In some embodiments the grout is introduced into the formation as a liquid and the liquid sets in the formation to form a solid. The grout may be any type of grout including but not limited to fine cement micro fine cement sulfur sulfur cement viscous thermoplastics and or waxes. The grout may include surfactants stabilizers or other chemicals that modify the properties of the grout. For example the presence of surfactant in the grout may promote entry of the grout into small openings in the formation.

Grout may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. The grout may be allowed to set. The integrity of the grout wall may be checked. The integrity of the grout wall may be checked by logging techniques and or by hydrostatic testing. If the permeability of a grouted section is too high additional grout may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. After the permeability of the grouted section is sufficiently reduced freeze wells may be installed in the freeze well wellbores.

Grout may be injected into the formation at a pressure that is high but below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments grouting is performed in 16 m increments in the freeze wellbore. Larger or smaller increments may be used if desired. In some embodiments grout is only applied to certain portions of the formation. For example grout may be applied to the formation through the freeze wellbore only adjacent to aquifer zones and or to relatively high permeability zones for example zones with a permeability greater than about 0.1 darcy . Applying grout to aquifers may inhibit migration of water from one aquifer to a different aquifer. For grout placed in the formation through freeze well wellbores the grout may inhibit water migration between aquifers during formation of the low temperature zone. The grout may also inhibit water migration between aquifers when an established low temperature zone is allowed to thaw.

In some embodiments the grout used to form a barrier may be fine cement and micro fine cement. Cement may provide structural support in the formation. Fine cement may be ASTM type 3 Portland cement. Fine cement may be less expensive than micro fine cement. In an embodiment a freeze wellbore is formed in the formation. Selected portions of the freeze wellbore are grouted using fine cement. Then micro fine cement is injected into the formation through the freeze wellbore. The fine cement may reduce the permeability down to about 10 millidarcy. The micro fine cement may further reduce the permeability to about 0.1 millidarcy. After the grout is introduced into the formation a freeze wellbore canister may be inserted into the formation. The process may be repeated for each freeze well that will be used to form the barrier.

In some embodiments fine cement is introduced into every other freeze wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the remaining wellbores. For example grout may be used in a formation with freeze wellbores set at about 5 m spacing. A first wellbore is drilled and fine cement is introduced into the formation through the wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the first wellbore. A second wellbore is drilled 10 m away from the first wellbore. Fine cement is introduced into the formation through the second wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the second wellbore. A third wellbore is drilled between the first wellbore and the second wellbore. In some embodiments grout from the first and or second wellbores may be detected in the cuttings of the third wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the formation through the third wellbore. A freeze wellbore canister is positioned in the third wellbore. The same procedure is used to form the remaining freeze wells that will form the barrier around the treatment area.

In some embodiments wax may be used to form a grout barrier. Wax barriers may be formed in wet dry or oil wetted formations. Liquid wax introduced into the formation may permeate into adjacent rock and fractures in the formation. Liquid wax may permeate into rock to fill microscopic as well as macroscopic pores and vugs in the rock. The wax solidifies to form a grout barrier that inhibits fluid flow into or out of a treatment area. A wax grout barrier may provide a minimal amount of structural support in the formation. Molten wax may reduce the strength of poorly consolidated soil by reducing inter grain friction so that the poorly consolidated soil sloughs or liquefies. Poorly consolidated layers may be consolidated by use of cement or other binding agents before introduction of molten wax.

The wax of a barrier may be a branched paraffin to for example inhibit biological degradation of the wax. The wax may include stabilizers surfactants or other chemicals that modify the physical and or chemical properties of the wax. The physical properties may be tailored to meet specific needs. The wax may melt at a relative low temperature for example the wax may have a typical melting point of about 52 C. . The temperature at which the wax congeals may be at least 5 C. 10 C. 20 C. or 30 C. above the ambient temperature of the formation prior to any heating of the formation. When molten the wax may have a relatively low viscosity for example 4 to 10 cp at about 99 C. . The flash point of the wax may be relatively high for example the flash point may be over 204 C. . The wax may have a density less than the density of water and may have a heat capacity that is less than half the heat capacity of water. The solid wax may have a low thermal conductivity for example about 0.18 W m C. so that the solid wax is a thermal insulator. Waxes suitable for forming a barrier are available as WAXFIX from Carter Technologies Company Sugar Land Tex. U.S.A. .

In some embodiments a wax barrier or wax barriers may be used as the barriers for the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments a wax barrier may be used in conjunction with freeze wells that form a low temperature barrier around the treatment area. In some embodiments the wax barrier is formed and freeze wells are installed in the wellbores used for introducing wax into the formation. In some embodiments the wax barrier is formed in wellbores offset from the freeze well wellbores. The wax barrier may be on the outside or the inside of the freeze wells. In some embodiments a wax barrier may be formed on both the inside and outside of the freeze wells. The wax barrier may inhibit water flow in the formation that would inhibit the formation of the low temperature zone by the freeze wells. In some embodiments a wax barrier is formed in the inter barrier zone between two freeze barriers of a double barrier system.

Wellbores may be formed in the formation around the treatment area at a close spacing. In some embodiments the spacing is from about 1.5 m to about 4 m. Low temperature heaters may be inserted in the wellbores. The heaters may operate at temperatures from about 260 C. to about 320 C. so that the temperature at the formation face is below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heaters may be activated to heat the formation until the overlap between two adjacent heaters raises the temperature of the zone between the two heaters above the melting temperature of the wax. Heating the formation to obtain superposition of heat with a temperature above the melting temperature of the wax may take one month two months or longer. After heating the heaters may be turned off. Wax may be introduced into the wellbores to form the barrier. The wax may flow into the formation and fill any fractures and porosity that has been heated. The wax congeals when the wax flows to cold regions beyond the heated circumference. This wax barrier formation method may form a more complete barrier than some other methods of wax barrier formation but the time for heating may be longer than for some of the other methods. Also if a low temperature barrier is to be formed with the freeze wells placed in the wellbores used for wax injection the freeze wells will have to remove the heat supplied to the formation to allow for introduction of the wax. The low temperature barrier may take longer to form.

In some embodiments the wax barrier may be formed using a conduit placed in the wellbore. depicts an embodiment of a system for forming a wax barrier in a formation. Wellbore may extend into one or more layers below overburden . Wellbore may be an open wellbore below underburden . One or more of the layers may include fracture systems . One or more of the layers may be vuggy so that the layer or a portion of the layer has a high porosity. Conduit may be positioned in wellbore . In some embodiments low temperature heater may be strapped or attached to conduit . In some embodiments conduit may be a heater element. Heater may be operated so that the heater does not cause pyrolysis of hydrocarbons adjacent to the heater. At least a portion of wellbore may be filled with fluid. The fluid may be formation fluid or water. Heater may be activated to heat the fluid. A portion of the heated fluid may move outwards from heater into the formation. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones by introducing heated wax into wellbore in the annular space between conduit and the wellbore. The introduced wax flows to the areas heated by the fluid and congeals when the fluid reaches cold regions not heated by the fluid. The wax fills fracture systems and permeable vuggy pathways heated by the fluid but the wax may not permeate through a significant portion of the rock matrix as when the hot wax is introduced into a heated formation as described above. The wax flows into fracture systems a sufficient distance to join with wax injected from an adjacent well so that a barrier to fluid flow through the fracture systems forms when the wax congeals. A portion of wax may congeal along the wall of a fracture or a vug without completely blocking the fracture or filling the vug. The congealed wax may act as an insulator and allow additional liquid wax to flow beyond the congealed portion to penetrate deeply into the formation and form blockages to fluid flow when the wax cools below the melting temperature of the wax.

Wax in the annular space of wellbore between conduit and the formation may be removed through conduit by displacing the wax with water or other fluid. Conduit may be removed and a freeze well may be installed in the wellbore. This method may use less wax than the method described above. The heating of the fluid may be accomplished in less than a week or within a day. The small amount of heat input may allow for quicker formation of a low temperature barrier if freeze wells are to be positioned in the wellbores used to introduce wax into the formation.

In some embodiments a heater may be suspended in the well without a conduit that allows for removal of excess wax from the wellbore. The wax may be introduced into the well. After wax introduction the heater may be removed from the well. In some embodiments a conduit may be positioned in the wellbore but a heater may not be coupled to the conduit. Hot wax may be circulated through the conduit so that the wax enters fractures systems and or vugs adjacent to the wellbore.

In some embodiments wax may be used during the formation of a wellbore to improve inter zonal isolation and protect a low pressure zone from inflow from a high pressure zone. During wellbore formation where a high pressure zone and a low pressure zone are penetrated by a common wellbore it is possible for the high pressure zone to flow into the low pressure zone and cause an underground blowout. To avoid this the wellbore may be formed through the first zone. Then an intermediate casing may be set and cemented through the first zone. Setting casing may be time consuming and expensive. Instead of setting a casing wax may be used to seal the first zone. The wax may also inhibit or prevent mixing of high salinity brines from lower high pressure zones with fresher brines in upper lower pressure zones.

In some embodiments wax may be used to contain and inhibit migration in a subsurface formation that has liquid hydrocarbon contaminants for example compounds such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene condensed in fractures in the formation. The location of the contaminants may be surrounded with heated wax injection wells. Wax may be introduced into the wells to form an outer wax barrier. The wax injected into the fractures from the wax injection wells may mix with the contaminants. The contaminants may be solubilized into the wax. When the wax congeals the contaminants may be permanently contained in the solid wax phase.

In some embodiments a composition that includes a cross linkable polymer may be used with or in addition to a wax. Such composition may be provided to the formation as is described above for the wax. The composition may be configured to react and solidify after a selected time in the formation thereby allowing the composition to be provided as a liquid to the formation. The cross linkable polymer may include for example acrylates methacrylates urethanes and or epoxies. A cross linking initiator may be included in the composition. The composition may also include a cross linking inhibitor. The cross linking inhibitor may be configured to degrade while in the formation thereby allowing the composition to solidify.

In certain embodiments a barrier may be formed in the formation after an in situ heat treatment process or a solution mining process by introducing a fluid into the formation. The in situ heat treatment process may heat the treatment area and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. The solution mining process may remove material from the treatment area and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. In certain embodiments the treatment area has an increased permeability of at least 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments the treatment area has an increased permeability of at least 1 darcy of at least 10 darcy or of at least 100 darcy. The increased permeability allows the fluid to spread in the formation into fractures microfractures and or pore spaces in the formation. The fluid may include wax bitumen heavy oil sulfur polymer saturated saline solution and or a reactant or reactants that react to form a precipitate solid or a high viscosity fluid in the formation. In some embodiments bitumen heavy oil and or sulfur used to form the barrier are obtained from treatment facilities of the in situ heat treatment process.

The fluid may be introduced into the formation as a liquid vapor or mixed phase fluid. The fluid may be introduced into a portion of the formation that is at an elevated temperature. In some embodiments the fluid is introduced into the formation through wells located near a perimeter of the treatment area. The fluid may be directed away from the treatment area. The elevated temperature of the formation maintains or allows the fluid to have a low viscosity so that the fluid moves away from the wells. A portion of the fluid may spread outwards in the formation towards a cooler portion of the formation. In the cooler portion of the formation the viscosity of the fluid increases a portion of the fluid precipitates and or the fluid solidifies or thickens so that the fluid forms the barrier to flow of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area.

In some embodiments a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds all or a portion of the treatment area. As the fluid introduced into the formation approaches the low temperature barrier the temperature of the formation becomes colder. The colder temperature increases the viscosity of the fluid enhances precipitation and or solidifies the fluid to form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The fluid may remain in the formation as a highly viscous fluid or a solid after the low temperature barrier has dissipated.

In certain embodiments saturated saline solution is introduced into the formation. Components in the saturated saline solution may precipitate out of solution when the solution reaches a colder temperature. The solidified particles may form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The solidified components may be substantially insoluble in formation fluid.

In certain embodiments brine is introduced into the formation as a reactant. A second reactant such a carbon dioxide may be introduced into the formation to react with the brine. The reaction may generate a mineral complex that grows in the formation. The mineral complex may be substantially insoluble to formation fluid. In an embodiment the brine solution includes a sodium and aluminum solution. The second reactant introduced in the formation is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide reacts with the brine solution to produce dawsonite. The minerals may solidify and form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation.

In some embodiments the barrier may be formed using sulfur. Molten sulfur may be introduced into the formation through wells located near the perimeter of the treatment area. At least a portion of the sulfur spreads outwards from the treatment area towards a cooler portion of the formation. The introduced sulfur spreads outward and solidifies in the formation to form a sulfur barrier. The solidified sulfur in the formation forms a barrier to formation fluid flow into or out of the treatment area.

A temperature monitoring system may be installed in wellbores of freeze wells and or in monitor wells adjacent to the freeze wells to monitor the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or the low temperature zone established by the freeze wells. The monitoring system may be used to monitor progress of low temperature zone formation. The monitoring system may be used to determine the location of high temperature areas potential breakthrough locations or breakthrough locations after the low temperature zone has formed. Periodic monitoring of the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or low temperature zone established by the freeze wells may allow additional cooling to be provided to potential trouble areas before breakthrough occurs. Additional cooling may be provided at or adjacent to breakthroughs and high temperature areas to ensure the integrity of the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Additional cooling may be provided by increasing refrigerant flow through selected freeze wells installing an additional freeze well or freeze wells and or by providing a cryogenic fluid such as liquid nitrogen to the high temperature areas. Providing additional cooling to potential problem areas before breakthrough occurs may be more time efficient and cost efficient than sealing a breach reheating a portion of the treatment area that has been cooled by influx of fluid and or remediating an area outside of the breached frozen barrier.

In some embodiments a traveling thermocouple may be used to monitor the temperature profile of selected freeze wells or monitor wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system includes thermocouples placed at discrete locations in the wellbores of the freeze wells in the freeze wells and or in the monitoring wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system comprises a fiber optic temperature monitoring system.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems are available from Sensornet London United Kingdom Sensa Houston Tex. U.S.A. Luna Energy Blacksburg Va. U.S.A. Lios Technology GMBH Cologne Germany Oxford Electronics Ltd. Hampshire United Kingdom and Sabeus Sensor Systems Calabasas Calif. U.S.A. . The fiber optic temperature monitoring system includes a data system and one or more fiber optic cables. The data system includes one or more lasers for sending light to the fiber optic cable and one or more computers software and peripherals for receiving analyzing and outputting data. The data system may be coupled to one or more fiber optic cables.

A single fiber optic cable may be several kilometers long. The fiber optic cable may be installed in many freeze wells and or monitor wells. In some embodiments two fiber optic cables may be installed in each freeze well and or monitor well. The two fiber optic cables may be coupled. Using two fiber optic cables per well allows for compensation due to optical losses that occur in the wells and allows for better accuracy of measured temperature profiles.

The fiber optic temperature monitoring system may be used to detect the location of a breach or a potential breach in a frozen barrier. The search for potential breaches may be performed at scheduled intervals for example every two or three months. To determine the location of the breach or potential breach flow of formation refrigerant to the freeze wells of interest is stopped. In some embodiments the flow of formation refrigerant to all of the freeze wells is stopped. The rise in the temperature profiles as well as the rate of change of the temperature profiles provided by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for each freeze well can be used to determine the location of any breaches or hot spots in the low temperature zone maintained by the freeze wells. The temperature profile monitored by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for the two freeze wells closest to the hot spot or fluid flow will show the quickest and greatest rise in temperature. A temperature change of a few degrees Centigrade in the temperature profiles of the freeze wells closest to a troubled area may be sufficient to isolate the location of the trouble area. The shut down time of flow of circulation fluid in the freeze wells of interest needed to detect breaches potential breaches and hot spots may be on the order of a few hours or days depending on the well spacing and the amount of fluid flow affecting the low temperature zone.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems may also be used to monitor temperatures in heated portions of the formation during in situ heat treatment processes. The fiber of a fiber optic cable used in the heated portion of the formation may be clad with a reflective material to facilitate retention of a signal or signals transmitted down the fiber. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with gold copper nickel aluminum and or alloys thereof. The cladding may be formed of a material that is able to withstand chemical and temperature conditions in the heated portion of the formation. For example gold cladding may allow an optical sensor to be used up to temperatures of 700 C. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with aluminum. The fiber may be dipped in or run through a bath of liquid aluminum. The clad fiber may then be allowed to cool to secure the aluminum to the fiber. The gold or aluminum cladding may reduce hydrogen darkening of the optical fiber.

A potential source of heat loss from the heated formation is due to reflux in wells. Refluxing occurs when vapors condense in a well and flow into a portion of the well adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. Vapors may condense in the well adjacent to the overburden of the formation to form condensed fluid. Condensed fluid flowing into the well adjacent to the heated formation absorbs heat from the formation. Heat absorbed by condensed fluids cools the formation and necessitates additional energy input into the formation to maintain the formation at a desired temperature. Some fluids that condense in the overburden and flow into the portion of the well adjacent to the heated formation may react to produce undesired compounds and or coke. Inhibiting fluids from refluxing may significantly improve the thermal efficiency of the in situ heat treatment system and or the quality of the product produced from the in situ heat treatment system.

For some well embodiments the portion of the well adjacent to the overburden section of the formation is cemented to the formation. In some well embodiments the well includes packing material placed near the transition from the heated section of the formation to the overburden. The packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing from the heated section of the formation into the section of the wellbore adjacent to the overburden. Cables conduits devices and or instruments may pass through the packing material but the packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing up the wellbore adjacent to the overburden section of the formation.

In some embodiments a gas may be introduced into the formation through wellbores to inhibit reflux in the wellbores. In some embodiments gas may be introduced into wellbores that include baffle systems to inhibit reflux of fluid in the wellbores. The gas may be carbon dioxide methane nitrogen or other desired gas.

In some well embodiments a ball type reflux baffle system may be used in heater wells to inhibit reflux. depicts an embodiment of ball type reflux baffle system positioned in a cased portion of a heater well. Ball type reflux baffle may include insert and balls . A portion of heater element passes through insert . The portion of heater element that passes through insert is a portion of the heater element that does not heat to a high temperature. Insert may be made of metal plastic and or steel able to withstand temperatures of over 160 C. In an embodiment insert is made of phenolic resin.

Insert may be guided down the casing of the wellbore using a coil tubing guide string. Insert may be set in position using slips that fit in one or more indentions in the insert using protrusions of the insert that fit in one or more recesses in the casing or the insert may rest on a shoulder of the casing. After removal of the coil tubing guide string balls may be dropped down the casing onto insert . Balls may be made of any desired material able to withstand temperatures of over 160 C. In some embodiments balls are made of silicon nitride. Balls of varying diameters may be used. Balls inhibit fluid convection.

During the in situ heat treatment process heater element may need to be pulled from the well. When heater element is removed from the well balls may pass through insert to the bottom of the well. Another heater element may be installed in the well and additional balls may be dropped down the well to land on insert .

In some embodiments one or more circular baffles may be coupled to a portion of a heating element to inhibit convection of fluid. The baffles may substantially fill the annular space between the heating element and the casing. The baffles may be made of an electrically insulative material such as a ceramic or plastic. In some embodiments the baffles may be made of fiberglass or silicon nitride. The baffles may position the heating element in the center of the casing.

The ball type baffle system and or the circular baffle system may work better if a gas purge is introduced into the wellbore. The gas purge may maintain sufficient pressure in the wellbore to inhibit fluid flow from the heated portion of the formation into the wellbore. The gas purge may enhance heat exchange at the baffle system to help maintain a top portion of the baffle system colder than the lower portion of the baffle system.

The flow of production fluid up the well to the surface is desired for some types of wells especially for production wells. Flow of production fluid up the well is also desirable for some heater wells that are used to control pressure in the formation. The overburden or a conduit in the well used to transport formation fluid from the heated portion of the formation to the surface may be heated to inhibit condensation on or in the conduit. Providing heat in the overburden however may be costly and or may lead to increased cracking or coking of formation fluid as the formation fluid is being produced from the formation.

To avoid the need to heat the overburden or to heat the conduit passing through the overburden one or more diverters may be placed in the wellbore to inhibit fluid from refluxing into the wellbore adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments the diverter retains fluid above the heated portion of the formation. Fluids retained in the diverter may be removed from the diverter using a pump gas lifting and or other fluid removal technique. In certain embodiments two or more diverters that retain fluid above the heated portion of the formation may be located in the production well. Two or more diverters provide a simple way of separating initial fractions of condensed fluid produced from the in situ heat treatment system. A pump may be placed in each of the diverters to remove condensed fluid from the diverters.

In some embodiments the diverter directs fluid to a sump below the heated portion of the formation. An inlet for a lift system may be located in the sump. In some embodiments the intake of the lift system is located in casing in the sump. In some embodiments the intake of the lift system is located in an open wellbore. The sump is below the heated portion of the formation. The intake of the pump may be located 1 m 5 m 10 m 20 m or more below the deepest heater used to heat the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be at a cooler temperature than the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be more than 10 C. more than 50 C. more than 75 C. or more than 100 C. below the temperature of the heated portion of the formation. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may be liquid. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may condense within the sump. The lift system moves the fluid in the sump to the surface.

Production well lift systems may be used to efficiently transport formation fluid from the bottom of the production wells to the surface. Production well lift systems may provide and maintain the maximum required well drawdown minimum reservoir producing pressure and producing rates. The production well lift systems may operate efficiently over a wide range of high temperature multiphase fluids gas vapor steam water hydrocarbon liquids and production rates expected during the life of a typical project. Production well lift systems may include dual concentric rod pump lift systems chamber lift systems and other types of lift systems.

Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self limit temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the material to provide a reduced amount of heat at or near the Curie temperature when a time varying current is applied to the material. In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic material self limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments the selected temperature is within about 35 C. within about 25 C. within about 20 C. or within about 10 C. of the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials for example highly conductive materials high strength materials corrosion resistant materials or combinations thereof to provide various electrical and or mechanical properties. Some parts of the temperature limited heater may have a lower resistance caused by different geometries and or by using different ferromagnetic and or non ferromagnetic materials than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.

Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are able to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds or is about to exceed a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties for example electrical resistance of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.

In certain embodiments the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced second heat output heat output near at or above the Curie temperature of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time varying current. The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self limit. In some embodiments the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature about 50 C. about 75 C. about 100 C. or about 125 C. below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.

The temperature limited heater may be energized by time varying current alternating current or modulated direct current supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components for example modulation components transformers and or capacitors used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials the skin effect is dominated by the magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 for example the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50 100 500 1000 or greater . As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature and or as the applied electrical current is increased the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly for example the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability . The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near at or above the Curie temperature and or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source portions of the heater that approach reach or are above the Curie temperature may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows the heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.

Curie temperature heaters have been used in soldering equipment heaters for medical applications and heating elements for ovens for example pizza ovens . Some of these uses are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 579 575 to Lamome et al. 5 065 501 to Henschen et al. and 5 512 732 to Yagnik et al. all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. U.S. Pat. No. 4 849 611 to Whitney et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes a plurality of discrete spaced apart heating units including a reactive component a resistive heating component and a temperature responsive component.

An advantage of using the temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater and other equipment below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion creep and or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibit overheating or burnout of the heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and or withstand heat at temperatures above 25 C. 37 C. 100 C. 250 C. 500 C. 700 C. 800 C. 900 C. or higher up to 1131 C. depending on the materials used in the heater.

The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and burn out. The heat output adjacent to the low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater but the remaining portions of the temperature limited heater that are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output. Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths for example at least 10 m 100 m 300 m 500 m 1 km or more up to about 10 km the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater.

The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis typically requires 9.5 years to 10 years of heating when using a 12 m heater well spacing with conventional constant wattage heaters. For the same heater spacing temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis may occur in 5 years using temperature limited heaters with a 12 m heater well spacing. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underburden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.

Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids mobilizing fluids and or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in the formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.

The use of temperature limited heaters in some embodiments eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to perform temperature logging and or the need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.

In certain embodiments phase transformation for example crystalline phase transformation or a change in the crystal structure of materials used in a temperature limited heater change the selected temperature at which the heater self limits. Ferromagnetic material used in the temperature limited heater may have a phase transformation for example a transformation from ferrite to austenite that decreases the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material. This reduction in magnetic permeability is similar to reduction in magnetic permeability due to the magnetic transition of the ferromagnetic material at the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is the magnetic transition temperature of the ferrite phase of the ferromagnetic material. The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the temperature limited heater near at or above the temperature of the phase transformation and or the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

The phase transformation of the ferromagnetic material may occur over a temperature range. The temperature range of the phase transformation depends on the ferromagnetic material and may vary for example over a range of about 20 C. to a range of about 200 C. Because the phase transformation takes place over a temperature range the reduction in the magnetic permeability due to the phase transformation takes place over the temperature range. The reduction in magnetic permeability may also occur irregularly over the temperature range of the phase transformation. In some embodiments the phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase of the ferromagnetic material is slower than the phase transformation to the higher temperature phase for example the transition from austenite back to ferrite is slower than the transition from ferrite to austenite . The slower phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase may cause irregular operation of the heater at or near the phase transformation temperature range.

In some embodiments the phase transformation temperature range overlaps with the reduction in the magnetic permeability when the temperature approaches the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. The overlap may produce a slower drop in electrical resistance versus temperature than if the reduction in magnetic permeability is solely due to the temperature approaching the Curie temperature. The overlap may also produce irregular behavior of the temperature limited heater near the Curie temperature and or in the phase transformation temperature range.

In certain embodiments alloy additions are made to the ferromagnetic material to adjust the temperature range of the phase transformation. For example adding carbon to the ferromagnetic material may increase the phase transformation temperature range and lower the onset temperature of the phase transformation. Adding titanium to the ferromagnetic material may increase the onset temperature of the phase transformation and decrease the phase transformation temperature range. Alloy compositions may be adjusted to provide desired Curie temperature and phase transformation properties for the ferromagnetic material. The alloy composition of the ferromagnetic material may be chosen based on desired properties for the ferromagnetic material such as but not limited to magnetic permeability transition temperature or temperature range resistance versus temperature profile or power output . Addition of titanium may allow higher Curie temperatures to be obtained when adding cobalt to 410 stainless steel by raising the ferrite to austenite phase transformation temperature range to a temperature range that is above or well above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater is deformation tolerant. Localized movement of material in the wellbore may result in lateral stresses on the heater that could deform its shape. Locations along a length of the heater at which the wellbore approaches or closes on the heater may be hot spots where a standard heater overheats and has the potential to burn out. These hot spots may lower the yield strength and creep strength of the metal allowing crushing or deformation of the heater. The temperature limited heater may be formed with S curves or other non linear shapes that accommodate deformation of the temperature limited heater without causing failure of the heater.

In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are more economical to manufacture or make than standard heaters. Typical ferromagnetic materials include iron carbon steel or ferritic stainless steel. Such materials are inexpensive as compared to nickel based heating alloys such as nichrome Kanthal Bulten Kanthal AB Sweden and or LOHM Driver Harris Company Harrison N.J. U.S.A. typically used in insulated conductor mineral insulated cable heaters. In one embodiment of the temperature limited heater the temperature limited heater is manufactured in continuous lengths as an insulated conductor heater to lower costs and improve reliability.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is placed in the heater well using a coiled tubing rig. A heater that can be coiled on a spool may be manufactured by using metal such as ferritic stainless steel for example 409 stainless steel that is welded using electrical resistance welding ERW . To form a heater section a metal strip from a roll is passed through a first former where it is shaped into a tubular and then longitudinally welded using ERW. The tubular is passed through a second former where a conductive strip for example a copper strip is applied drawn down tightly on the tubular through a die and longitudinally welded using ERW. A sheath may be formed by longitudinally welding a support material for example steel such as 347H or 347HH over the conductive strip material. The support material may be a strip rolled over the conductive strip material. An overburden section of the heater may be formed in a similar manner.

In certain embodiments the overburden section uses a non ferromagnetic material such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel instead of a ferromagnetic material. The heater section and overburden section may be coupled using standard techniques such as butt welding using an orbital welder. In some embodiments the overburden section material the non ferromagnetic material may be pre welded to the ferromagnetic material before rolling. The pre welding may eliminate the need for a separate coupling step for example butt welding . In an embodiment a flexible cable for example a furnace cable such as a MGT 1000 furnace cable may be pulled through the center after forming the tubular heater. An end bushing on the flexible cable may be welded to the tubular heater to provide an electrical current return path. The tubular heater including the flexible cable may be coiled onto a spool before installation into a heater well. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater is installed using the coiled tubing rig. The coiled tubing rig may place the temperature limited heater in a deformation resistant container in the formation. The deformation resistant container may be placed in the heater well using conventional methods.

Temperature limited heaters may be used for heating hydrocarbon formations including but not limited to oil shale formations coal formations tar sands formations and formations with heavy viscous oils. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in the field of environmental remediation to vaporize or destroy soil contaminants. Embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be used to heat fluids in a wellbore or sub sea pipeline to inhibit deposition of paraffin or various hydrates. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater is used for solution mining a subsurface formation for example an oil shale or a coal formation . In certain embodiments a fluid for example molten salt is placed in a wellbore and heated with a temperature limited heater to inhibit deformation and or collapse of the wellbore. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is attached to a sucker rod in the wellbore or is part of the sucker rod itself. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are used to heat a near wellbore region to reduce near wellbore oil viscosity during production of high viscosity crude oils and during transport of high viscosity oils to the surface. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater enables gas lifting of a viscous oil by lowering the viscosity of the oil without coking the oil. Temperature limited heaters may be used in sulfur transfer lines to maintain temperatures between about 110 C. and about 130 C.

The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Curie temperature data for various metals is listed in American Institute of Physics Handbook Second Edition McGraw Hill pages 5 170 through 5 176. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements iron cobalt and nickel and or alloys of these elements. In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductors include iron chromium Fe Cr alloys that contain tungsten W for example HCM12A and SAVE12 Sumitomo Metals Co. Japan and or iron alloys that contain chromium for example Fe Cr alloys Fe Cr W alloys Fe Cr V vanadium alloys and Fe Cr Nb Niobium alloys . Of the three main ferromagnetic elements iron has a Curie temperature of approximately 770 C. cobalt Co has a Curie temperature of approximately 1131 C. and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358 C. An iron cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example iron cobalt alloy with 2 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 800 C. iron cobalt alloy with 12 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 900 C. and iron cobalt alloy with 20 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 950 C.

For example iron nickel alloy with 20 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 720 C. and iron nickel alloy with 60 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 560 C.

Some non ferromagnetic elements used as alloys raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example an iron vanadium alloy with 5.9 by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815 C. Other non ferromagnetic elements for example carbon aluminum copper silicon and or chromium may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and or chemical properties. In some embodiments the Curie temperature material is a ferrite such as NiFeO. In other embodiments the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNior FeAl.

Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material. Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.

Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as the Curie temperature is approached. The Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry by C. James Erickson IEEE Press 1995 shows a typical curve for 1 carbon steel steel with 1 carbon by weight . The loss of magnetic permeability starts at temperatures above 650 C. and tends to be complete when temperatures exceed 730 C. Thus the self limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1 carbon steel is 0.132 cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720 C. From 720 C. to 730 C. the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1 carbon steel begins to self limit between 650 C. and 730 C.

Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time varying current into the conductive material. In general current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately 1 e of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth the skin depth is 1981.5 3 in which 

EQN. 3 is obtained from Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry by C. James Erickson IEEE Press 1995 . For most metals resistivity increases with temperature. The relative magnetic permeability generally varies with temperature and with current. Additional equations may be used to assess the variance of magnetic permeability and or skin depth on both temperature and or current. The dependence of on current arises from the dependence of on the electromagnetic field.

Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 10 1 30 1 or 50 1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used. A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located for example a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers and or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore for example temperature limits of heater materials . In some embodiments the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material for example adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature .

The temperature limited heater may provide a maximum heat output power output below the Curie temperature of the heater. In certain embodiments the maximum heat output is at least 400 W m Watts per meter 600 W m 700 W m 800 W m or higher up to 2000 W m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches or is above the Curie temperature. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W m 200 W m 100 W m or may approach 0 W m.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates substantially independently of the thermal load on the heater in a certain operating temperature range. Thermal load is the rate that heat is transferred from a heating system to its surroundings. It is to be understood that the thermal load may vary with temperature of the surroundings and or the thermal conductivity of the surroundings. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater operates at or above the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater such that the operating temperature of the heater increases at most by 3 C. 2 C. 1.5 C. 1 C. or 0.5 C. for a decrease in thermal load of 1 W m proximate to a portion of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates in such a manner at a relatively constant current.

The AC or modulated DC resistance and or the heat output of the temperature limited heater may decrease as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature and decrease sharply near or above the Curie temperature due to the Curie effect. In certain embodiments the value of the electrical resistance or heat output above or near the Curie temperature is at most one half of the value of electrical resistance or heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the heat output above or near the Curie temperature is at most 90 70 50 30 20 10 or less down to 1 of the heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature . In certain embodiments the electrical resistance above or near the Curie temperature decreases to 80 70 60 50 or less down to 1 of the electrical resistance at a certain point below the Curie temperature for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature .

In some embodiments AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. For example the skin depth of 1 carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz 0.0762 cm at 180 Hz and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the skin depth using a higher frequency and thus a heater with a smaller diameter reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry the higher frequency results in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz between 140 Hz and 200 Hz or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used for example 180 Hz 540 Hz or 720 Hz . In some embodiments high frequencies may be used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.

To maintain a substantially constant skin depth until the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater is reached the heater may be operated at a lower frequency when the heater is cold and operated at a higher frequency when the heater is hot. Line frequency heating is generally favorable however because there is less need for expensive components such as power supplies transformers or current modulators that alter frequency. Line frequency is the frequency of a general supply of current. Line frequency is typically 60 Hz but may be 50 Hz or another frequency depending on the source for the supply of the current. Higher frequencies may be produced using commercially available equipment such as solid state variable frequency power supplies. Transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power with three times the frequency are commercially available. For example high voltage three phase power at 60 Hz may be transformed to single phase power at 180 Hz and at a lower voltage. Such transformers are less expensive and more energy efficient than solid state variable frequency power supplies. In certain embodiments transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power are used to increase the frequency of power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments modulated DC for example chopped DC waveform modulated DC or cycled DC may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current. In some embodiments the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC to DC converter system. DC to DC converter systems are generally known in the art. DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include but are not limited to square wave sinusoidal deformed sinusoidal deformed square wave triangular and other regular or irregular waveforms.

The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus the modulated DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and or the rate of modulation such as the rate of chopping of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For example modulated DC may be provided at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing the frequency of supplied current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties for example subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example as the temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases it may be advantageous to increase the frequency of the current provided to the heater thus increasing the turndown ratio of the heater. In an embodiment the downhole temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore is assessed.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is varied to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of the temperature limited heater. For example the turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.

At or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material a relatively small change in voltage may cause a relatively large change in current to the load. The relatively small change in voltage may produce problems in the power supplied to the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature. The problems include but are not limited to reducing the power factor tripping a circuit breaker and or blowing a fuse. In some cases voltage changes may be caused by a change in the load of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments an electrical current supply for example a supply of modulated DC or AC provides a relatively constant amount of current that does not substantially vary with changes in load of the temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the electrical current supply provides an amount of electrical current that remains within 15 within 10 within 5 or within 2 of a selected constant current value when a load of the temperature limited heater changes.

Temperature limited heaters may generate an inductive load. The inductive load is due to some applied electrical current being used by the ferromagnetic material to generate a magnetic field in addition to generating a resistive heat output. As downhole temperature changes in the temperature limited heater the inductive load of the heater changes due to changes in the ferromagnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials in the heater with temperature. The inductive load of the temperature limited heater may cause a phase shift between the current and the voltage applied to the heater.

A reduction in actual power applied to the temperature limited heater may be caused by a time lag in the current waveform for example the current has a phase shift relative to the voltage due to an inductive load and or by distortions in the current waveform for example distortions in the current waveform caused by introduced harmonics due to a non linear load . Thus it may take more current to apply a selected amount of power due to phase shifting or waveform distortion. The ratio of actual power applied and the apparent power that would have been transmitted if the same current were in phase and undistorted is the power factor. The power factor is always less than or equal to 1. The power factor is 1 when there is no phase shift or distortion in the waveform.

Actual power applied to a heater due to a phase shift may be described by EQN. 4 cos 4 in which P is the actual power applied to a heater I is the applied current V is the applied voltage and is the phase angle difference between voltage and current. Other phenomena such as waveform distortion may contribute to further lowering of the power factor. If there is no distortion in the waveform then cos is equal to the power factor.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes an inner conductor inside an outer conductor. The inner conductor and the outer conductor are radially disposed about a central axis. The inner and outer conductors may be separated by an insulation layer. In certain embodiments the inner and outer conductors are coupled at the bottom of the temperature limited heater. Electrical current may flow into the temperature limited heater through the inner conductor and return through the outer conductor. One or both conductors may include ferromagnetic material.

The insulation layer may comprise an electrically insulating ceramic with high thermal conductivity such as magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. The insulating layer may be a compacted powder for example compacted ceramic powder . Compaction may improve thermal conductivity and provide better insulation resistance. For lower temperature applications polymer insulation made from for example fluoropolymers polyimides polyamides and or polyethylenes may be used. In some embodiments the polymer insulation is made of perfluoroalkoxy PFA or polyetheretherketone PEEK Victrex Ltd England . The insulating layer may be chosen to be substantially infrared transparent to aid heat transfer from the inner conductor to the outer conductor. In an embodiment the insulating layer is transparent quartz sand. The insulation layer may be air or a non reactive gas such as helium nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride. If the insulation layer is air or a non reactive gas there may be insulating spacers designed to inhibit electrical contact between the inner conductor and the outer conductor. The insulating spacers may be made of for example high purity aluminum oxide or another thermally conducting electrically insulating material such as silicon nitride. The insulating spacers may be a fibrous ceramic material such as Nextel 312 3M Corporation St. Paul Minn. U.S.A. mica tape or glass fiber. Ceramic material may be made of alumina alumina silicate alumina borosilicate silicon nitride boron nitride or other materials.

The insulation layer may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. For example if the insulation layer is a solid or compacted material that substantially fills the space between the inner and outer conductors the temperature limited heater may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. Forces on the outer conductor can be transmitted through the insulation layer to the solid inner conductor which may resist crushing. Such a temperature limited heater may be bent dog legged and spiraled without causing the outer conductor and the inner conductor to electrically short to each other. Deformation tolerance may be important if the wellbore is likely to undergo substantial deformation during heating of the formation.

In certain embodiments an outermost layer of the temperature limited heater for example the outer conductor is chosen for corrosion resistance yield strength and or creep resistance. In one embodiment austenitic non ferromagnetic stainless steels such as 201 304H 347H 347HH 316H 310H 347HP NF709 Nippon Steel Corp. Japan stainless steels or combinations thereof may be used in the outer conductor. The outermost layer may also include a clad conductor. For example a corrosion resistant alloy such as 800H or 347H stainless steel may be clad for corrosion protection over a ferromagnetic carbon steel tubular. If high temperature strength is not required the outermost layer may be constructed from ferromagnetic metal with good corrosion resistance such as one of the ferritic stainless steels. In one embodiment a ferritic alloy of 82.3 by weight iron with 17.7 by weight chromium Curie temperature of 678 C. provides desired corrosion resistance.

In temperature limited heater embodiments with both an inner ferromagnetic conductor and an outer ferromagnetic conductor the skin effect current path occurs on the outside of the inner conductor and on the inside of the outer conductor. Thus the outside of the outer conductor may be clad with the corrosion resistant alloy such as stainless steel without affecting the skin effect current path on the inside of the outer conductor.

A ferromagnetic conductor with a thickness of at least the skin depth at the Curie temperature allows a substantial decrease in resistance of the ferromagnetic material as the skin depth increases sharply near the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments when the ferromagnetic conductor is not clad with a highly conducting material such as copper the thickness of the conductor may be 1.5 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature 3 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature or even 10 or more times the skin depth near the Curie temperature. If the ferromagnetic conductor is clad with copper thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be substantially the same as the skin depth near the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor clad with copper has a thickness of at least three fourths of the skin depth near the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a composite conductor with a ferromagnetic tubular and a non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core. The non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core reduces a required diameter of the conductor. For example the conductor may be composite 1.19 cm diameter conductor with a core of 0.575 cm diameter copper clad with a 0.298 cm thickness of ferritic stainless steel or carbon steel surrounding the core. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may be copper or copper alloy. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may also be made of other metals that exhibit low electrical resistivity and relative magnetic permeabilities near 1 for example substantially non ferromagnetic materials such as aluminum and aluminum alloys phosphor bronze beryllium copper and or brass . A composite conductor allows the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater to decrease more steeply near the Curie temperature. As the skin depth increases near the Curie temperature to include the copper core the electrical resistance decreases very sharply.

The composite conductor may increase the conductivity of the temperature limited heater and or allow the heater to operate at lower voltages. In an embodiment the composite conductor exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile at temperatures below a region near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor of the composite conductor. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile between 100 C. and 750 C. or between 300 C. and 600 C. The relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile may also be exhibited in other temperature ranges by adjusting for example materials and or the configuration of materials in the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in the composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in a composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for a temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the composite conductor is an inner conductor surrounded by 0.127 cm thick magnesium oxide powder as an insulator. The outer conductor may be 304H stainless steel with a wall thickness of 0.127 cm. The outside diameter of the heater may be about 1.65 cm.

A composite conductor for example a composite inner conductor or a composite outer conductor may be manufactured by methods including but not limited to coextrusion roll forming tight fit tubing for example cooling the inner member and heating the outer member then inserting the inner member in the outer member followed by a drawing operation and or allowing the system to cool explosive or electromagnetic cladding arc overlay welding longitudinal strip welding plasma powder welding billet coextrusion electroplating drawing sputtering plasma deposition coextrusion casting magnetic forming molten cylinder casting of inner core material inside the outer or vice versa insertion followed by welding or high temperature braising shielded active gas welding SAG and or insertion of an inner pipe in an outer pipe followed by mechanical expansion of the inner pipe by hydroforming or use of a pig to expand and swage the inner pipe against the outer pipe. In some embodiments a ferromagnetic conductor is braided over a non ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments composite conductors are formed using methods similar to those used for cladding for example cladding copper to steel . A metallurgical bond between copper cladding and base ferromagnetic material may be advantageous. Composite conductors produced by a coextrusion process that forms a good metallurgical bond for example a good bond between copper and 446 stainless steel may be provided by Anomet Products Inc. Shrewsbury Mass. U.S.A. .

In some embodiments the conductor for example an inner conductor an outer conductor or a ferromagnetic conductor is the composite conductor that includes two or more different materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes two or more ferromagnetic materials. In some embodiments the composite ferromagnetic conductor includes two or more radially disposed materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes a ferromagnetic conductor and a non ferromagnetic conductor. In some embodiments the composite conductor includes the ferromagnetic conductor placed over a non ferromagnetic core. Two or more materials may be used to obtain a relatively flat electrical resistivity versus temperature profile in a temperature region below the Curie temperature and or a sharp decrease a high turndown ratio in the electrical resistivity at or near the Curie temperature. In some cases two or more materials are used to provide more than one Curie temperature for the temperature limited heater.

The composite electrical conductor may be used as the conductor in any electrical heater embodiment described herein. For example the composite conductor may be used as the conductor in a conductor in conduit heater or an insulated conductor heater. In certain embodiments the composite conductor may be coupled to a support member such as a support conductor. The support member may be used to provide support to the composite conductor so that the composite conductor is not relied upon for strength at or near the Curie temperature. The support member may be useful for heaters of lengths of at least 100 m. The support member may be a non ferromagnetic member that has good high temperature creep strength. Examples of materials that are used for a support member include but are not limited to Haynes 625 alloy and Haynes HR120 alloy Haynes International Kokomo Ind. U.S.A. NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy and 347HP alloy Allegheny Ludlum Corp. Pittsburgh Pa. U.S.A. . In some embodiments materials in a composite conductor are directly coupled for example brazed metallurgically bonded or swaged to each other and or the support member. Using a support member may reduce the need for the ferromagnetic member to provide support for the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature. Thus the temperature limited heater may be designed with more flexibility in the selection of ferromagnetic materials.

In certain embodiments the diameter of core is adjusted relative to a constant outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. For example the diameter of core may be increased to 1.14 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor at 1.9 cm to increase the turndown ratio of the heater.

In some embodiments conductors for example core and ferromagnetic conductor in the composite conductor are separated by support member . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor with support member separating the conductors. In one embodiment core is copper with a diameter of 0.95 cm support member is 347H alloy with an outside diameter of 1.9 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm. The support member depicted in has a lower creep strength relative to the support members depicted in .

In certain embodiments support member is located inside the composite conductor. depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . Support member is made of 347H alloy. Inner conductor is copper. Ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel. In one embodiment support member is 1.25 cm diameter 347H alloy inner conductor is 1.9 cm outside diameter copper and ferromagnetic conductor is 2.7 cm outside diameter 446 stainless steel. The turndown ratio is higher than the turndown ratio for the embodiments depicted in and for the same outside diameter but the creep strength is lower.

In some embodiments the thickness of inner conductor which is copper is reduced and the thickness of support member is increased to increase the creep strength at the expense of reduced turndown ratio. For example the diameter of support member is increased to 1.6 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of inner conductor at 1.9 cm to reduce the thickness of the conduit. This reduction in thickness of inner conductor results in a decreased turndown ratio relative to the thicker inner conductor embodiment but an increased creep strength.

In one embodiment support member is a conduit or pipe inside inner conductor and ferromagnetic conductor . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . In one embodiment support member is 347H alloy with a 0.63 cm diameter center hole. In some embodiments support member is a preformed conduit. In certain embodiments support member is formed by having a dissolvable material for example copper dissolvable by nitric acid located inside the support member during formation of the composite conductor. The dissolvable material is dissolved to form the hole after the conductor is assembled. In an embodiment support member is 347H alloy with an inside diameter of 0.63 cm and an outside diameter of 1.6 cm inner conductor is copper with an outside diameter of 1.8 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm.

In certain embodiments the composite electrical conductor is used as the conductor in the conductor in conduit heater. For example the composite electrical conductor may be used as conductor in

Conduit is made of an electrically conductive material. Conduit is disposed in opening in hydrocarbon layer . Opening has a diameter that accommodates conduit .

Conductor may be centered in conduit by centralizers . Centralizers electrically isolate conductor from conduit . Centralizers inhibit movement and properly locate conductor in conduit . Centralizers are made of ceramic material or a combination of ceramic and metallic materials. Centralizers inhibit deformation of conductor in conduit . Centralizers are touching or spaced at intervals between approximately 0.1 m meters and approximately 3 m or more along conductor .

A second low resistance section of conductor may couple conductor to wellhead as depicted in . Electrical current may be applied to conductor from power cable through low resistance section of conductor . Electrical current passes from conductor through sliding connector to conduit . Conduit may be electrically insulated from overburden casing and from wellhead to return electrical current to power cable . Heat may be generated in conductor and conduit . The generated heat may radiate in conduit and opening to heat at least a portion of hydrocarbon layer .

Overburden casing may be disposed in overburden . Overburden casing is in some embodiments surrounded by materials for example reinforcing material and or cement that inhibit heating of overburden . Low resistance section of conductor may be placed in overburden casing . Low resistance section of conductor is made of for example carbon steel. Low resistance section of conductor may be centralized in overburden casing using centralizers . Centralizers are spaced at intervals of approximately 6 m to approximately 12 m or for example approximately 9 m along low resistance section of conductor . In a heater embodiment low resistance section of conductor is coupled to conductor by one or more welds. In other heater embodiments low resistance sections are threaded threaded and welded or otherwise coupled to the conductor. Low resistance section generates little or no heat in overburden casing . Packing may be placed between overburden casing and opening . Packing may be used as a cap at the junction of overburden and hydrocarbon layer to allow filling of materials in the annulus between overburden casing and opening . In some embodiments packing inhibits fluid from flowing from opening to surface .

For a temperature limited heater in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature a majority of the current flows through material with highly non linear functions of magnetic field H versus magnetic induction B . These non linear functions may cause strong inductive effects and distortion that lead to decreased power factor in the temperature limited heater at temperatures below the Curie temperature. These effects may render the electrical power supply to the temperature limited heater difficult to control and may result in additional current flow through surface and or overburden power supply conductors. Expensive and or difficult to implement control systems such as variable capacitors or modulated power supplies may be used to compensate for these effects and to control temperature limited heaters where the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by current flow through the ferromagnetic material.

In certain temperature limited heater embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to an electrical conductor coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor when the temperature limited heater is below or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor may be a sheath jacket support member corrosion resistant member or other electrically resistive member. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor positioned between an outermost layer and the ferromagnetic conductor. The ferromagnetic conductor is located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater such that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor at or below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor. The majority of the flow of electrical current is confined to the electrical conductor due to the skin effect of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the majority of the current is flowing through material with substantially linear resistive properties throughout most of the operating range of the heater.

In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor are located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater so that the skin effect of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of electrical current in the electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments the dimensions of the electrical conductor may be chosen to provide desired heat output characteristics.

Because the majority of the current flows through the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature the temperature limited heater has a resistance versus temperature profile that at least partially reflects the resistance versus temperature profile of the material in the electrical conductor. Thus the resistance versus temperature profile of the temperature limited heater is substantially linear below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor if the material in the electrical conductor has a substantially linear resistance versus temperature profile. For example the temperature limited heater in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature may have a resistance versus temperature profile similar to the profile shown in . The resistance of the temperature limited heater has little or no dependence on the current flowing through the heater until the temperature nears the Curie temperature. The majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature.

Resistance versus temperature profiles for temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor also tend to exhibit sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. For example the reduction in resistance shown in is sharper than the reduction in resistance shown in . The sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature are easier to control than more gradual resistance reductions near the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments the material and or the dimensions of the material in the electrical conductor are selected so that the temperature limited heater has a desired resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature are easier to predict and or control. Behavior of temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature may be predicted by for example its resistance versus temperature profile and or its power factor versus temperature profile. Resistance versus temperature profiles and or power factor versus temperature profiles may be assessed or predicted by for example experimental measurements that assess the behavior of the temperature limited heater analytical equations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater and or simulations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments assessed or predicted behavior of the temperature limited heater is used to control the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be controlled based on measurements assessments of the resistance and or the power factor during operation of the heater. In some embodiments the power or current supplied to the temperature limited heater is controlled based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater during operation of the heater and the comparison of this assessment versus the predicted behavior of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater is controlled without measurement of the temperature of the heater or a temperature near the heater. Controlling the temperature limited heater without temperature measurement eliminates operating costs associated with downhole temperature measurement. Controlling the temperature limited heater based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater also reduces the time for making adjustments in the power or current supplied to the heater compared to controlling the heater based on measured temperature.

As the temperature of the temperature limited heater approaches or exceeds the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor reduction in the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor allows electrical current to flow through a greater portion of the electrically conducting cross section of the temperature limited heater. Thus the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater is reduced and the temperature limited heater automatically provides reduced heat output at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments a highly electrically conductive member is coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor to reduce the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater at or above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The highly electrically conductive member may be an inner conductor a core or another conductive member of copper aluminum nickel or alloys thereof.

The ferromagnetic conductor that confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature may have a relatively small cross section compared to the ferromagnetic conductor in temperature limited heaters that use the ferromagnetic conductor to provide the majority of resistive heat output up to or near the Curie temperature. A temperature limited heater that uses the electrical conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature has low magnetic inductance at temperatures below the Curie temperature because less current is flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor as compared to the temperature limited heater where the majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature is provided by the ferromagnetic material. Magnetic field H at radius r of the ferromagnetic conductor is proportional to the current I flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor and the core divided by the radius or 5 Since only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for a temperature limited heater that uses the outer conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater may be significantly smaller than the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater where the majority of the current flows through the ferromagnetic material. The relative magnetic permeability pt may be large for small magnetic fields.

The skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative magnetic permeability 1 . 6 Increasing the relative magnetic permeability decreases the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor. However because only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for temperatures below the Curie temperature the radius or thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be decreased for ferromagnetic materials with large relative magnetic permeabilities to compensate for the decreased skin depth while still allowing the skin effect to limit the penetration depth of the electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The radius thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be between 0.3 mm and 8 mm between 0.3 mm and 2 mm or between 2 mm and 4 mm depending on the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor. Decreasing the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor decreases costs of manufacturing the temperature limited heater as the cost of ferromagnetic material tends to be a significant portion of the cost of the temperature limited heater. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor provides a higher turndown ratio and a sharper decrease in electrical resistance for the temperature limited heater at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Ferromagnetic materials such as purified iron or iron cobalt alloys with high relative magnetic permeabilities for example at least 200 at least 1000 at least 1 10 or at least 1 10 and or high Curie temperatures for example at least 600 C. at least 700 C. or at least 800 C. tend to have less corrosion resistance and or less mechanical strength at high temperatures. The electrical conductor may provide corrosion resistance and or high mechanical strength at high temperatures for the temperature limited heater. Thus the ferromagnetic conductor may be chosen primarily for its ferromagnetic properties.

Confining the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor reduces variations in the power factor. Because only a portion of the electrical current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature the non linear ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor have little or no effect on the power factor of the temperature limited heater except at or near the Curie temperature. Even at or near the Curie temperature the effect on the power factor is reduced compared to temperature limited heaters in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature. Thus there is less or no need for external compensation for example variable capacitors or waveform modification to adjust for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater to maintain a relatively high power factor.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater which confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor maintains the power factor above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater. Any reduction in the power factor occurs only in sections of the temperature limited heater at temperatures near the Curie temperature. Most sections of the temperature limited heater are typically not at or near the Curie temperature during use. These sections have a high power factor that approaches 1.0. The power factor for the entire temperature limited heater is maintained above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater even if some sections of the heater have power factors below 0.85.

Maintaining high power factors allows for less expensive power supplies and or control devices such as solid state power supplies or SCRs silicon controlled rectifiers . These devices may fail to operate properly if the power factor varies by too large an amount because of inductive loads. With the power factors maintained at high values however these devices may be used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Solid state power supplies have the advantage of allowing fine tuning and controlled adjustment of the power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments transformers are used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps may be made into the transformer to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps allows the current supplied to switch back and forth between the multiple voltages. This maintains the current within a range bound by the multiple voltage taps.

The highly electrically conductive member or inner conductor increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments thickness of the highly electrically conductive member is increased to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments the thickness of the electrical conductor is reduced to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater is between 1.1 and 10 between 2 and 8 or between 3 and 6 for example the turndown ratio is at least 1.1 at least 2 or at least 3 .

In certain embodiments electrical conductor provides support for ferromagnetic conductor and the temperature limited heater. Electrical conductor may be made of a material that provides good mechanical strength at temperatures near or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a corrosion resistant member. Electrical conductor support member may provide support for ferromagnetic conductor and corrosion resistance. Electrical conductor is made from a material that provides desired electrically resistive heat output at temperatures up to and or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor .

In an embodiment electrical conductor is 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor is another electrically conductive good mechanical strength corrosion resistant material. For example electrical conductor may be 304H 316H 347HH NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy Inco Alloys International Huntington W. Va. U.S.A. Haynes HR120 alloy or Inconel 617 alloy.

In some embodiments electrical conductor support member includes different alloys in different portions of the temperature limited heater. For example a lower portion of electrical conductor support member is 347H stainless steel and an upper portion of the electrical conductor support member is NF709. In certain embodiments different alloys are used in different portions of the electrical conductor support member to increase the mechanical strength of the electrical conductor support member while maintaining desired heating properties for the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductor includes different ferromagnetic conductors in different portions of the temperature limited heater. Different ferromagnetic conductors may be used in different portions of the temperature limited heater to vary the Curie temperature and thus the maximum operating temperature in the different portions. In some embodiments the Curie temperature in an upper portion of the temperature limited heater is lower than the Curie temperature in a lower portion of the heater. The lower Curie temperature in the upper portion increases the creep rupture strength lifetime in the upper portion of the heater.

In the embodiment depicted in ferromagnetic conductor electrical conductor and core are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the support member when the temperature is below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater depicted in is smaller for example an outside diameter of 3 cm 2.9 cm 2.5 cm or less than other temperature limited heaters that do not use electrical conductor to provide the majority of electrically resistive heat output. The temperature limited heater depicted in may be smaller because ferromagnetic conductor is thin as compared to the size of the ferromagnetic conductor needed for a temperature limited heater in which the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by the ferromagnetic conductor.

In some embodiments the support member and the corrosion resistant member are different members in the temperature limited heater. depict embodiments of temperature limited heaters in which the jacket provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In these embodiments electrical conductor is jacket . Electrical conductor ferromagnetic conductor support member and core in or inner conductor in are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the thickness of the jacket. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a material that is corrosion resistant and provides electrically resistive heat output below the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . For example electrical conductor is 825 stainless steel or 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor has a small thickness for example on the order of 0.5 mm .

In core is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. Support member is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor .

In support member is the core of the temperature limited heater and is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . Inner conductor is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.

In certain embodiments the materials and design of the temperature limited heater are chosen to allow use of the heater at high temperatures for example above 850 C. . depicts a high temperature embodiment of the temperature limited heater. The heater depicted in operates as a conductor in conduit heater with the majority of heat being generated in conduit . The conductor in conduit heater may provide a higher heat output because the majority of heat is generated in conduit rather than conductor . Having the heat generated in conduit reduces heat losses associated with transferring heat between the conduit and conductor .

Core and conductive layer are copper. In some embodiments core and conductive layer are nickel if the operating temperatures is to be near or above the melting point of copper. Support members are electrically conductive materials with good mechanical strength at high temperatures. Materials for support members that withstand at least a maximum temperature of about 870 C. may be but are not limited to MO RE alloys Duraloy Technologies Inc. Scottdale Pa. U.S.A. CF8C Metaltek Intl. Waukesha Wis. U.S.A. or Inconel 617 alloy. Materials for support members that withstand at least a maximum temperature of about 980 C. include but are not limited to Incoloy Alloy MA 956. Support member in conduit provides mechanical support for the conduit. Support member in conductor provides mechanical support for core .

Electrical conductor is a thin corrosion resistant material. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is 347H 617 625 or 800H stainless steel. Ferromagnetic conductor is a high Curie temperature ferromagnetic material such as iron cobalt alloy for example a 15 by weight cobalt iron cobalt alloy .

In certain embodiments electrical conductor provides the majority of heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . Conductive layer increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.

For long vertical temperature limited heaters for example heaters at least 300 m at least 500 m or at least 1 km in length the hanging stress becomes important in the selection of materials for the temperature limited heater. Without the proper selection of material the support member may not have sufficient mechanical strength for example creep rupture strength to support the weight of the temperature limited heater at the operating temperatures of the heater. depicts hanging stress ksi kilopounds per square inch versus outside diameter in. for the temperature limited heater shown in with 347H as the support member. The hanging stress was assessed with the support member outside a 0.5 copper core and a 0.75 outside diameter carbon steel ferromagnetic conductor. This assessment assumes the support member bears the entire load of the heater and that the heater length is 1000 ft. about 305 m . As shown in increasing the thickness of the support member decreases the hanging stress on the support member. Decreasing the hanging stress on the support member allows the temperature limited heater to operate at higher temperatures.

In certain embodiments materials for the support member are varied to increase the maximum allowable hanging stress at operating temperatures of the temperature limited heater and thus increase the maximum operating temperature of the temperature limited heater. Altering the materials of the support member affects the heat output of the temperature limited heater below the Curie temperature because changing the materials changes the resistance versus temperature profile of the support member. In certain embodiments the support member is made of more than one material along the length of the heater so that the temperature limited heater maintains desired operating properties for example resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature as much as possible while providing sufficient mechanical properties to support the heater.

In some embodiments a transition section is used between sections of the heater. For example if one or more portions of the heater have varying Curie temperatures a transition section may be used between portions to provide strength that compensates for the differences in temperatures in the portions. depicts another example of an embodiment of a temperature limited heater able to provide desired heat output and mechanical strength. The support member in heater portion is 347H stainless steel. The support member in heater portion is NF709. The support member in heater portion is 347H. Portion has a length of 550 ft. and a Curie temperature of 843 C. portion has a length of 250 ft. and a Curie temperature of 843 C. and portion has a length of 180 ft. and a Curie temperature of 770 C. Transition section has a length of 20 ft. a Curie temperature of 770 C. and the support member is NF709.

The materials of the support member along the length of the temperature limited heater may be varied to achieve a variety of desired operating properties. The choice of the materials of the temperature limited heater is adjusted depending on a desired use of the temperature limited heater. TABLE 1 lists examples of materials that may be used for the support member. The table provides the hanging stresses of the support members and the maximum operating temperatures of the temperature limited heaters for several different outside diameters OD of the support member. The core diameter and the outside diameter of the iron ferromagnetic conductor in each case are 0.5 and 0.765 respectively.

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying outside diameters and or materials to provide desired properties for the heater. depict examples of embodiments for temperature limited heaters that vary the diameter and or materials of the support member along the length of the heaters to provide desired operating properties and sufficient mechanical properties for example creep rupture strength properties for operating temperatures up to about 834 C. for 30 000 hrs. heater lengths of 850 ft a copper core diameter of 0.5 and an iron cobalt 6 by weight cobalt ferromagnetic conductor outside diameter of 0.75 . In portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 300 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 400 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 150 ft and an outside diameter of 1.25 . In portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 300 ft and an outside diameter of 1.15 . Portion is 347H stainless steel with a length of 100 ft and an outside diameter of 1.20 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 350 ft and an outside diameter of 1.20 . Portion is NF709 with a length of 100 ft and an outside diameter of 1.25 .

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying dimensions and or varying materials to provide different power outputs along the length of the heater. More or less power output may be provided by varying the selected temperature for example the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater by using different ferromagnetic materials along its length and or by varying the electrical resistance of the heater by using different dimensions in the heat generating member along the length of the heater. Different power outputs along the length of the temperature limited heater may be needed to compensate for different thermal properties in the formation adjacent to the heater. For example an oil shale formation may have different water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions at different depths in the formation. Portions of the formation with higher water filled porosities higher dawsonite compositions and or higher nahcolite compositions may need more power input than portions with lower water filled porosities lower dawsonite compositions and or lower nahcolite compositions to achieve a similar heating rate. Power output may be varied along the length of the heater so that the portions of the formation with different properties such as water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions are heated at approximately the same heating rate.

In certain embodiments portions of the temperature limited heater have different selected self limiting temperatures for example Curie temperatures materials and or dimensions to compensate for varying thermal properties of the formation along the length of the heater. For example Curie temperatures support member materials and or dimensions of the portions of the heaters depicted in may be varied to provide varying power outputs and or operating temperatures along the length of the heater.

As one example in an embodiment of the temperature limited heater depicted in portion may be used to heat portions of the formation that on average have higher water filled porosities dawsonite compositions and or nahcolite compositions than portions of the formation heated by portion . Portion may provide less power output than portion to compensate for the differing thermal properties of the different portions of the formation so that the entire formation is heated at an approximately constant heating rate. Portion may require less power output because for example portion is used to heat portions of the formation with low water filled porosities and or little or no dawsonite. In one embodiment portion has a Curie temperature of 770 C. pure iron and portion has a Curie temperature of 843 C. iron with added cobalt . Such an embodiment may provide more power output from portion so that the temperature lag between the two portions is reduced. Adjusting the Curie temperature of portions of the heater adjusts the selected temperature at which the heater self limits. In some embodiments the dimensions of portion are adjusted to further reduce the temperature lag so that the formation is heated at an approximately constant heating rate throughout the formation. Dimensions of the heater may be adjusted to adjust the heating rate of one or more portions of the heater. For example the thickness of an outer conductor in portion may be increased relative to the ferromagnetic member and or the core of the heater so that the portion has a higher electrical resistance and the portion provides a higher power output below the Curie temperature of the portion.

Reducing the temperature lag between different portions of the formation may reduce the overall time needed to bring the formation to a desired temperature. Reducing the time needed to bring the formation to the desired temperature reduces heating costs and produces desirable production fluids more quickly.

Temperature limited heaters with varying Curie temperatures may also have varying support member materials to provide mechanical strength for the heater for example to compensate for hanging stress of the heater and or provide sufficient creep rupture strength properties . For example in the embodiment of the temperature limited heater depicted in portions and have a Curie temperature of 843 C. Portion has a support member made of 347H stainless steel. Portion has a support member made of NF709. Portion has a Curie temperature of 770 C. and a support member made of 347H stainless steel. Transition section has a Curie temperature of 770 C. and a support member made of NF709. Transition section may be short in length compared to portions and . Transition section may be placed between portions and to compensate for the temperature and material differences between the portions. For example transition section may be used to compensate for differences in creep properties between portions and .

Such a substantially vertical temperature limited heater may have less expensive lower strength materials in portion because of the lower Curie temperature in this portion of the heater. For example 347H stainless steel may be used for the support member because of the lower maximum operating temperature of portion as compared to portion . Portion may require more expensive higher strength material because of the higher operating temperature of portion due to the higher Curie temperature in this portion.

In some embodiments a relatively thin conductive layer is used to provide the majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Such a temperature limited heater may be used as the heating member in an insulated conductor heater. The heating member of the insulated conductor heater may be located inside a sheath with an insulation layer between the sheath and the heating member.

Inner conductor is a relatively thin conductive layer of non ferromagnetic material with a higher electrical conductivity than ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments inner conductor is copper. Inner conductor may be a copper alloy. Copper alloys typically have a flatter resistance versus temperature profile than pure copper. A flatter resistance versus temperature profile may provide less variation in the heat output as a function of temperature up to the Curie temperature. In some embodiments inner conductor is copper with 6 by weight nickel for example CuNi6 or LOHM . In some embodiments inner conductor is CuNi10Fe1Mn alloy. Below the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to inner conductor . Thus inner conductor provides the majority of the resistive heat output of insulated conductor below the Curie temperature.

In certain embodiments inner conductor is dimensioned along with core and ferromagnetic conductor so that the inner conductor provides a desired amount of heat output and a desired turndown ratio. For example inner conductor may have a cross sectional area that is around 2 or 3 times less than the cross sectional area of core . Typically inner conductor has to have a relatively small cross sectional area to provide a desired heat output if the inner conductor is copper or copper alloy. In an embodiment with copper inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.03 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.53 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.79 cm. In an embodiment with a CuNi6 inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.12 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.63 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.88 cm. Such insulated conductors are typically smaller and cheaper to manufacture than insulated conductors that do not use the thin inner conductor to provide the majority of heat output below the Curie temperature.

Electrical insulator may be magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments electrical insulator is a compacted powder of magnesium oxide. In some embodiments electrical insulator includes beads of silicon nitride.

In certain embodiments a small layer of material is placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor to inhibit copper from migrating into the electrical insulator at higher temperatures. For example a small layer of nickel for example about 0.5 mm of nickel may be placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor .

Jacket is made of a corrosion resistant material such as but not limited to 347 stainless steel 347H stainless steel 446 stainless steel or 825 stainless steel. In some embodiments jacket provides some mechanical strength for insulated conductor at or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments jacket is not used to conduct electrical current.

In certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters three temperature limited heaters are coupled together in a three phase wye configuration. Coupling three temperature limited heaters together in the three phase wye configuration lowers the current in each of the individual temperature limited heaters because the current is split between the three individual heaters. Lowering the current in each individual temperature limited heater allows each heater to have a small diameter. The lower currents allow for higher relative magnetic permeabilities in each of the individual temperature limited heaters and thus higher turndown ratios. In addition there may be no return current needed for each of the individual temperature limited heaters. Thus the turndown ratio remains higher for each of the individual temperature limited heaters than if each temperature limited heater had its own return current path.

In the three phase wye configuration individual temperature limited heaters may be coupled together by shorting the sheaths jackets or canisters of each of the individual temperature limited heaters to the electrically conductive sections the conductors providing heat at their terminating ends for example the ends of the heaters at the bottom of a heater wellbore . In some embodiments the sheaths jackets canisters and or electrically conductive sections are coupled to a support member that supports the temperature limited heaters in the wellbore.

In insulated conductors are coiled on coiled tubing rigs . As insulated conductors are uncoiled from rigs the insulated conductors are coupled to support member . In certain embodiments insulated conductors are simultaneously uncoiled and or simultaneously coupled to support member . Insulated conductors may be coupled to support member using metal for example 304 stainless steel or Inconel alloys straps . In some embodiments insulated conductors are coupled to support member using other types of fasteners such as buckles wire holders or snaps. Support member along with insulated conductors are installed into opening . In some embodiments insulated conductors are coupled together without the use of a support member. For example one or more straps may be used to couple insulated conductors together.

Insulated conductors may be electrically coupled to each other at a lower end of the insulated conductors. In a three phase wye configuration insulated conductors operate without a current return path. In certain embodiments insulated conductors are electrically coupled to each other in contactor section . In section sheaths jackets canisters and or electrically conductive sections are electrically coupled to each other and or to support member so that insulated conductors are electrically coupled in the section.

In certain embodiments the sheaths of insulated conductors are shorted to the conductors of the insulated conductors. depicts an embodiment of insulated conductor with the sheath shorted to the conductors. Sheath is electrically coupled to core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor using termination . Termination may be a metal strip or a metal plate at the lower end of insulated conductor . For example termination may be a copper plate coupled to sheath core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor so that they are shorted together. In some embodiments termination is welded or brazed to sheath core ferromagnetic conductor and inner conductor .

The sheaths of individual insulated conductors may be shorted together to electrically couple the conductors of the insulated conductors. In some embodiments sheaths may be shorted together because the sheaths are in physical contact with each other. For example the sheaths may in physical contact if the sheaths are strapped together by straps . In some embodiments the lower ends of the sheaths are physically coupled for example welded at the surface of opening before insulated conductors are installed into the opening.

In some embodiments a long temperature limited heater for example a temperature limited heater in which the support member provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor is formed from several sections of heater. The sections of heater may be coupled using a welding process. depicts an embodiment for coupling together sections of a long temperature limited heater. Ends of ferromagnetic conductors and ends of electrical conductors support members are beveled to facilitate coupling the sections of the heater. Core has recesses to allow core coupling material to be placed inside the abutted ends of the heater. Core coupling material may be a pin or dowel that fits tightly in the recesses of cores . Core coupling material may be made out of the same material as cores or a material suitable for coupling the cores together. Core coupling material allows the heaters to be coupled together without welding cores together. Cores are coupled together as a pin or box joint.

Beveled ends of ferromagnetic conductors and electrical conductors may be coupled together with coupling material . In certain embodiments ends of ferromagnetic conductors and electrical conductors are welded for example orbital welded together. Coupling material may be 625 stainless steel or any other suitable non ferromagnetic material for welding together ferromagnetic conductors and or electrical conductors . Using beveled ends when coupling together sections of the heater may produce a reliable and durable coupling between the sections of the heater.

During heating with the temperature limited heater core coupling material may expand more radially than ferromagnetic conductors electrical conductors and or coupling material . The greater expansion of core coupling material maintains good electrical contact with the core coupling material. At the coupling junction of the heater electricity flows through core coupling material rather than coupling material . This flow of electricity inhibits heat generation at the coupling junction so that the junction remains at lower temperatures than other portions of the heater during application of electrical current to the heater. The corrosion resistance and strength of the coupling junction is increased by maintaining the junction at lower temperatures.

In certain embodiments the junction may be enclosed in a shield during orbital welding to ensure reliability of the weld. If the junction is not enclosed disturbance of the inert gas caused by wind humidity or other conditions may cause oxidation and or porosity of the weld. Without a shield a first portion of the weld was formed and allowed to cool. A grinder would be used to remove the oxide layer. The process would be repeated until the weld was complete. Enclosing the junction in the shield with an inert gas allows the weld to be formed with no oxidation thus allowing the weld to be formed in one pass with no need for grinding. Enclosing the junction increases the safety of forming the weld because the arc of the orbital welder is enclosed in the shield during welding. Enclosing the junction in the shield may reduce the time needed to form the weld. Without a shield producing each weld may take 30 minutes or more. With the shield each weld may take 10 minutes or less.

Hinged door may be closed. The orbital welder may be used to weld the lower conductor to the upper conductor. Progress of the welding operation may be monitored through viewing windows . When the weld is complete shield may be supported and first clamp member may be unfastened from second clamp member . One or both inserts may be removed or partially removed from lower plate and upper plate to facilitate lowering of the conductor. The conductor may be lowered in the wellbore until the end of the conductor is located at a desired position in shield . Shield may be secured to the conductor with first clamp member and second clamp member . Another conductor may be positioned in the shield. Inserts may be positioned in upper and lower plates hinged door is closed and the orbital welder is used to weld the conductors together. The process may be repeated until a desired length of conductor is formed.

The shield may be used to weld joints of pipe over an opening in the hydrocarbon containing formation. Hydrocarbon vapors from the formation may create an explosive atmosphere in the shield even though the inert gas supplied to the shield inhibits the formation of dangerous concentrations of hydrocarbons in the shield. A control circuit may be coupled to a power supply for the orbital welder to stop power to the orbital welder to shut off the arc forming the weld if the hydrocarbon level in the shield rises above a selected concentration. depicts a schematic representation of an embodiment of a shut off circuit for orbital welding machine . An inert gas such as argon may enter shield through inlet . Gas may exit shield through purge . Power supply supplies electricity to orbital welding machine through lines . Switch may be located in line to orbital welding machine . Switch may be electrically coupled to hydrocarbon monitor . Hydrocarbon monitor may detect the hydrocarbon concentration in shield . If the hydrocarbon concentration in shield becomes too high for example over 25 of a lower explosion limit concentration hydrocarbon monitor may open switch . When switch is open power to orbital welder is interrupted and the arc formed by the orbital welder ends.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is used to achieve lower temperature heating for example for heating fluids in a production well heating a surface pipeline or reducing the viscosity of fluids in a wellbore or near wellbore region . Varying the ferromagnetic materials of the temperature limited heater allows for lower temperature heating. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor is made of material with a lower Curie temperature than that of 446 stainless steel. For example the ferromagnetic conductor may be an alloy of iron and nickel. The alloy may have between 30 by weight and 42 by weight nickel with the rest being iron. In one embodiment the alloy is Invar 36. Invar 36 is 36 by weight nickel in iron and has a Curie temperature of 277 C. In some embodiments an alloy is a three component alloy with for example chromium nickel and iron. For example an alloy may have 6 by weight chromium 42 by weight nickel and 52 by weight iron. A 2.5 cm diameter rod of Invar 36 has a turndown ratio of approximately 2 to 1 at the Curie temperature. Placing the Invar 36 alloy over a copper core may allow for a smaller rod diameter. A copper core may result in a high turndown ratio. The insulator in lower temperature heater embodiments may be made of a high performance polymer insulator such as PFA or PEEK when used with alloys with a Curie temperature that is below the melting point or softening point of the polymer insulator.

In certain embodiments a conductor in conduit temperature limited heater is used in lower temperature applications by using lower Curie temperature ferromagnetic materials. For example a lower Curie temperature ferromagnetic material may be used for heating inside sucker pump rods. Heating sucker pump rods may be useful to lower the viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump or rod and or to maintain a lower viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump rod. Lowering the viscosity of the oil may inhibit sticking of a pump used to pump the fluids. Fluids in the sucker pump rod may be heated up to temperatures less than about 250 C. or less than about 300 C. Temperatures need to be maintained below these values to inhibit coking of hydrocarbon fluids in the sucker pump system.

Conductive section electrically couples inner conductor to outer conductor and or jacket . In some embodiments jacket touches or electrically contacts conductive layer for example if the heater is placed in a horizontal configuration . If jacket is a ferromagnetic metal such as carbon steel with a Curie temperature above the Curie temperature of outer conductor current will propagate only on the inside of the jacket. Thus the outside of the jacket remains electrically uncharged during operation. In some embodiments jacket is drawn down for example swaged down in a die onto conductive layer so that a tight fit is made between the jacket and the conductive layer. The heater may be spooled as coiled tubing for insertion into a wellbore. In other embodiments an annular space is present between conductive layer and jacket as depicted in .

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater includes a flexible cable for example a furnace cable as the inner conductor. For example the inner conductor may be a 27 nickel clad or stainless steel clad stranded copper wire with four layers of mica tape surrounded by a layer of ceramic and or mineral fiber for example alumina fiber aluminosilicate fiber borosilicate fiber or aluminoborosilicate fiber . A stainless steel clad stranded copper wire furnace cable may be available from Anomet Products Inc. The inner conductor may be rated for applications at temperatures of 1000 C. or higher. The inner conductor may be pulled inside a conduit. The conduit may be a ferromagnetic conduit for example a Schedule 80 446 stainless steel pipe . The conduit may be covered with a layer of copper or other electrical conductor with a thickness of about 0.3 cm or any other suitable thickness. The assembly may be placed inside a support conduit for example a 1 Schedule 80 347H or 347HH stainless steel tubular . The support conduit may provide additional creep rupture strength and protection for the copper and the inner conductor. For uses at temperatures greater than about 1000 C. the inner copper conductor may be plated with a more corrosion resistant alloy for example Incoloy 825 to inhibit oxidation. In some embodiments the top of the temperature limited heater is sealed to inhibit air from contacting the inner conductor.

The temperature limited heater may be a single phase heater or a three phase heater. In a three phase heater embodiment the temperature limited heater has a delta or a wye configuration. Each of the three ferromagnetic conductors in the three phase heater may be inside a separate sheath. A connection between conductors may be made at the bottom of the heater inside a splice section. The three conductors may remain insulated from the sheath inside the splice section.

In some embodiments the three phase heater includes three legs that are located in separate wellbores. The legs may be coupled in a common contacting section for example a central wellbore a connecting wellbore or a solution filled contacting section . depicts an embodiment of temperature limited heaters coupled in a three phase configuration. Each leg may be located in separate openings in hydrocarbon layer . Each leg may include heating element . Each leg may be coupled to single contacting element in one opening . Contacting element may electrically couple legs together in a three phase configuration. Contacting element may be located in for example a central opening in the formation. Contacting element may be located in a portion of opening below hydrocarbon layer for example in the underburden . In certain embodiments magnetic tracking of a magnetic element located in a central opening for example opening of leg is used to guide the formation of the outer openings for example openings of legs and so that the outer openings intersect the central opening. The central opening may be formed first using standard wellbore drilling methods. Contacting element may include funnels guides or catchers for allowing each leg to be inserted into the contacting element.

In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed to hydrocarbon layer and fluids from the hydrocarbon layer. Thus heating elements are bare metal or exposed metal heating elements. Heating elements may be made from a material that has an acceptable sulfidation rate at high temperatures used for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature over at least a certain temperature range for example 500 C. to 650 C. 530 C. to 650 C. or 550 C. to 650 C. . For example 410 stainless steel may have a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature between 530 C. and 650 C. Using such materials reduces corrosion problems due to sulfur containing gases such as HS from the formation. In certain embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate below a selected value in a temperature range. In some embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate at most about 25 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. In some embodiments the sulfidation rate is at most about 35 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. at most about 45 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. or at most about 55 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. Heating elements may also be substantially inert to galvanic corrosion.

In some embodiments heating elements have a thin electrically insulating layer such as aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is a ceramic composition such as an enamel coating. Enamel coatings include but are not limited to high temperature porcelain enamels. High temperature porcelain enamels may include silicon dioxide boron oxide alumina and alkaline earth oxides CaO or MgO and minor amounts of alkali oxides NaO KO LiO . The enamel coating may be applied as a finely ground slurry by dipping the heating element into the slurry or spray coating the heating element with the slurry. The coated heating element is then heated in a furnace until the glass transition temperature is reached so that the slurry spreads over the surface of the heating element and makes the porcelain enamel coating. The porcelain enamel coating contracts when cooled below the glass transition temperature so that the coating is in compression. Thus when the coating is heated during operation of the heater the coating is able to expand with the heater without cracking.

The thin electrically insulating layer has low thermal impedance allowing heat transfer from the heating element to the formation while inhibiting current leakage between heating elements in adjacent openings and or current leakage into the formation. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is stable at temperatures above at least 350 C. above 500 C. or above 800 C. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer has an emissivity of at least 0.7 at least 0.8 or at least 0.9. Using the thin electrically insulating layer may allow for long heater lengths in the formation with low current leakage.

Heating elements may be coupled to contacting elements at or near the underburden of the formation. Contacting elements are copper or aluminum rods or other highly conductive materials. In certain embodiments transition sections are located between lead in conductors and heating elements and or between heating elements and contacting elements . Transition sections may be made of a conductive material that is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over a copper core. In certain embodiments transition sections are made of materials that electrically couple lead in conductors and heating elements while providing little or no heat output. Thus transition sections help to inhibit overheating of conductors and insulation used in lead in conductors by spacing the lead in conductors from heating elements . Transition section may have a length of between about 3 m and about 9 m for example about 6 m .

Contacting elements are coupled to contactor in contacting section to electrically couple legs to each other.

Each leg may be one leg of a three phase heater embodiment so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation. Legs may be arranged in a triangular pattern so that the three legs form a triangular shaped three phase heater. In an embodiment legs are arranged in a triangular pattern with 12 m spacing between the legs each side of the triangle has a length of 12 m .

In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer allows for relatively long substantially horizontal heater leg lengths in the hydrocarbon layer with a substantially u shaped heater. depicts a side view representation of an embodiment of a substantially u shaped three phase heater. First ends of legs are coupled to transformer at first location . In an embodiment transformer is a three phase AC transformer. Ends of legs are electrically coupled together with connector at second location . Connector electrically couples the ends of legs so that the legs can be operated in a three phase configuration. In certain embodiments legs are coupled to operate in a three phase wye configuration. In certain embodiments legs are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments legs are arranged in a triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heating elements include a thin electrically insulating material such as a porcelain enamel coating to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In certain embodiments legs are electrically coupled so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation.

In certain embodiments overburden casings for example overburden casings depicted in in overburden include materials that inhibit ferromagnetic effects in the casings. Inhibiting ferromagnetic effects in casings reduces heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated polyvinylchloride CPVC or high density polyethylene HDPE . HDPEs with working temperatures in a range for use in overburden include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. . A non metallic casing may also eliminate the need for an insulated overburden conductor. In some embodiments casings include carbon steel coupled on the inside diameter of a non ferromagnetic metal for example carbon steel clad with copper or aluminum to inhibit ferromagnetic effects or inductive effects in the carbon steel. Other non ferromagnetic metals include but are not limited to manganese steels with at least 10 by weight manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 by weight aluminum and austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel.

In certain embodiments one or more non ferromagnetic materials used in casings are used in a wellhead coupled to the casings and legs . Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead inhibits undesirable heating of components in the wellhead. In some embodiments a purge gas for example carbon dioxide nitrogen or argon is introduced into the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In certain embodiments one or more of legs are installed in the formation using coiled tubing. In certain embodiments coiled tubing is installed in the formation the leg is installed inside the coiled tubing and the coiled tubing is pulled out of the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The leg may be placed concentrically inside the coiled tubing. In some embodiments coiled tubing with the leg inside the coiled tubing is installed in the formation and the coiled tubing is removed from the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The coiled tubing may extend only to a junction of the hydrocarbon layer and the contacting section or to a point at which the leg begins to bend in the contacting section.

The phases of each triad may be arranged so that legs A B C correspond between triads as shown in . In legs A B C are arranged such that a phase leg for example leg A in a given triad is about two triad heights from a same phase leg leg A in an adjacent triad. The triad height is the distance from a vertex of the triad to a midpoint of the line intersecting the other two vertices of the triad. In certain embodiments the phases of triads are arranged to inhibit net current flow between individual triads. There may be some leakage of current within an individual triad but little net current flows between two triads due to the substantial electrical isolation of the triads and in certain embodiments the arrangement of the triad phases.

In the early stages of heating an exposed heating element for example heating element depicted in may leak some current to water or other fluids that are electrically conductive in the formation so that the formation itself is heated. After water or other electrically conductive fluids are removed from the wellbore for example vaporized or produced the heating elements become electrically isolated from the formation. Later when water is removed from the formation the formation becomes even more electrically resistant and heating of the formation occurs even more predominantly via thermally conductive and or radiative heating. Typically the formation the hydrocarbon layer has an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m.

Using the temperature limited heaters as the heating elements limits the effect of water saturation on heater efficiency. With water in the formation and in heater wellbores there is a tendency for electrical current to flow between heater elements at the top of the hydrocarbon layer where the voltage is highest and cause uneven heating in the hydrocarbon layer. This effect is inhibited with temperature limited heaters because the temperature limited heaters reduce localized overheating in the heating elements and in the hydrocarbon layer.

In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential. This location minimizes stray potentials at the production well. Placing production wells at such locations improves the safety of the system and reduces or inhibits undesired heating of the production wells caused by electrical current flow in the production wells. depicts a top view representation of the embodiment depicted in with production wells . In certain embodiments production wells are located at or near center of triad . In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location between triads at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential at a location at which voltage potentials from vertices of three triads average out to relatively little or zero voltage potential . For example production well may be at a location equidistant from legs A of one triad leg B of a second triad and leg C of a third triad as shown in .

Production well may be placed at or near the center of hexagon . Placing production well at or near the center of hexagon places the production well at a location that reduces or inhibits undesired heating due to electromagnetic effects caused by electrical current flow in the legs of the triads and increases the safety of the system. Having two triads in hexagon provides for redundant heating around production well . Thus if one triad fails or has to be turned off production well still remains at a center of one triad.

As shown in hexagons may be arranged in a pattern in the formation such that adjacent hexagons are offset. Using electrically isolated transformers on adjacent hexagons may inhibit electrical potentials in the formation so that little or no net current leaks between hexagons.

Contactor may be a casing or a solid rod placed in a wellbore drilled substantially horizontally in contacting section . Legs A A A and legs B B B may be electrically coupled to contactor by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to contactor for example by welding or brazing the containers to the contactor legs A A A and legs B B B are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the legs to the contactor. The containers may be coupled to contactor by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in contactor or coupled to the outside of the contactor and then brazing or welding the containers to the contactor.

In certain embodiments the electrical coupling material lines an upper portion such as the funnel shaped portion shown in of container . The electrical coupling material includes one or more materials that when activated for example heated ignited exploded combined mixed and or reacted form a material that electrically couples one or more elements to each other. In an embodiment the coupling material electrically couples contacting elements in container . In some embodiments the coupling material metallically bonds to contacting elements so that the contacting elements are metallically bonded to each other. In some embodiments container is initially filled with a high viscosity water based polymer fluid to inhibit drill cuttings or other materials from entering the container prior to using the coupling material to couple the contacting elements. The polymer fluid may be but is not limited to a cross linked XC polymer available from Baroid Industrial Drilling Products Houston Tex. U.S.A. a frac gel or a cross linked polyacrylamide gel.

In certain embodiments the electrical coupling material is a low temperature solder that melts at relatively low temperature and when cooled forms an electrical connection to exposed metal surfaces.

Other examples of such solders include but are not limited to a 54 by weight bismuth 16 by weight tin 30 by weight indium alloy and a 48 by weight tin 52 by weight indium alloy. Such low temperature solders will displace water upon melting so that the water moves to the top of container . Water at the top of container may inhibit heat transfer into the container and thermally insulate the low temperature solder so that the solder remains at cooler temperatures and does not melt during heating of the formation using the heating elements.

Container may be heated to activate the electrical coupling material to facilitate the connection of contacting elements . In certain embodiments container is heated to melt the electrical coupling material in the container. The electrical coupling material flows when melted and surrounds contacting elements in container . Any water within container will float to the surface of the metal when the metal is melted.

End portions of contacting elements of legs may have shapes and or features that enhance the electrical connection between the contacting elements and the coupling material. The shapes and or features of contacting elements may also enhance the physical strength of the connection between the contacting elements and the coupling material for example the shape and or features of the contacting element may anchor the contacting element in the coupling material . Shapes and or features for end portions of contacting elements include but are not limited to grooves notches holes threads serrated edges openings and hollow end portions. In certain embodiments the shapes and or features of the end portions of contacting elements are initially pre tinned with electrical coupling material.

In some embodiments container has a funnel shape as shown in that facilitates the entry of contacting elements into the container. In certain embodiments container is made of or includes copper for good electrical and thermal conductivity. A copper container makes good electrical contact with contacting elements such as contacting elements shown in if the contacting elements touch the walls and or bottom of the container.

Lower portions of contacting elements inside container may include 410 stainless steel or any other heat generating electrical conductor. Portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements include copper or another highly electrically conductive material. Centralizers may be located on the portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements. Centralizers inhibit physical and electrical contact of portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements against walls of container .

When contacting elements are locked into place inside container by protrusions at least some electrical current may pass between the contacting elements through the protrusions. As electrical current is passed through the heat generating portions of contacting elements heat is generated in container . The generated heat may melt coupling material located inside container . Water in container may boil. The boiling water may convect heat to upper portions of container and aid in melting of coupling material . Walls of container may be thermally insulated to reduce heat losses out of the container and allow the inside of the container to heat up faster. Coupling material flows down into the lower portion of container as the coupling material melts. Coupling material fills the lower portion of container until the heat generating portions of contacting elements are below the fill line of the coupling material. Coupling material then electrically couples the portions of contacting elements above the heat generating portions of the contacting elements. The resistance of contacting elements decreases at this point and heat is no longer generated in the contacting elements and the coupling materials is allowed to cool.

Heating elements may be coupled to portions of contacting elements inside container . Heating elements may include ferromagnetic materials such as iron or stainless steel. In an embodiment heating elements are iron cylinders clad onto contacting elements . Heating elements may be designed with dimensions and materials that will produce a desired amount of heat in container . In certain embodiments walls of container are thermally insulated with insulation layer as shown in to inhibit heat loss from the container. Heating elements may be spaced so that contacting elements have one or more portions of exposed material inside container . The exposed portions include exposed copper or another suitable highly electrically conductive material. The exposed portions allow for better electrical contact between contacting elements and coupling material after the coupling material has been melted fills container and is allowed to cool.

In certain embodiments heating elements operate as temperature limited heaters when a time varying current is applied to the heating elements. For example a 400 Hz AC current may be applied to heating elements . Application of the time varying current to contacting elements causes heating elements to generate heat and melt coupling material . Heating elements may operate as temperature limited heating elements with a self limiting temperature selected so that coupling material is not overheated. As coupling material fills container the coupling material makes electrical contact between portions of exposed material on contacting elements and electrical current begins to flow through the exposed material portions rather than heating elements . Thus the electrical resistance between the contacting elements decreases. As this occurs temperatures inside container begin to decrease and coupling material is allowed to cool to create an electrical contacting section between contacting elements . In certain embodiments electrical power to contacting elements and heating elements is turned off when the electrical resistance in the system falls below a selected resistance. The selected resistance may indicate that the coupling material has sufficiently electrically connected the contacting elements. In some embodiments electrical power is supplied to contacting elements and heating elements for a selected amount of time that is determined to provide enough heat to melt the mass of coupling material provided in container .

Time varying electrical current may be applied to contacting elements so that heating elements generate heat.

Contacting elements of legs may be made of the same material as inner container .

Explosive elements may be coupled to the outer wall of inner container . In certain embodiments explosive elements are elongated explosive strips that extend along the outer wall of inner container . Explosive elements may be arranged along the outer wall of inner container so that the explosive elements are aligned at or near the centers of contacting elements as shown in .

Explosive elements may be coupled to battery and timer . Battery may provide power to explosive elements to initiate the explosion. Timer may be used to control the time for igniting explosive elements . Battery and timer may be coupled to triggers . Triggers may be located in openings . Contacting elements may set off triggers as the contacting elements are placed into openings . When both triggers in openings are triggered timer may initiate a countdown before igniting explosive elements . Thus explosive elements are controlled to explode only after contacting elements are placed sufficiently into openings so that electrical contact may be made between the contacting elements and inner container after the explosions. Explosion of explosive elements crimps contacting elements and inner container together to make electrical contact between the contacting elements and the inner container. In certain embodiments explosive elements fire from the bottom towards the top of inner container .

Heating elements in legs and may be temperature limited heaters. In certain embodiments heating elements are solid rod heaters. For example heating elements may be rods made of a single ferromagnetic conductor element or composite conductors that include ferromagnetic material. During initial heating when water is present in the formation being heated heating elements may leak current into hydrocarbon layer . The current leaked into hydrocarbon layer may resistively heat the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments for example in oil shale formations heating elements do not need support members. Heating elements may be partially or slightly bent curved made into an S shape or made into a helical shape to allow for expansion and or contraction of the heating elements. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements are placed in small diameter wellbores for example about 3 about 9.5 cm diameter wellbores . Small diameter wellbores may be less expensive to drill or form than larger diameter wellbores and there will be less cuttings to dispose of.

In certain embodiments portions of legs and in overburden have insulation for example polymer insulation to inhibit heating the overburden. Heating elements may be substantially vertical and substantially parallel to each other in hydrocarbon layer . At or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer leg may be directionally drilled towards leg to intercept leg in contacting section . Drilling two wellbores to intercept each other may be easier and less expensive than drilling three or more wellbores to intercept each other. The depth of contacting section depends on the length of bend in leg needed to intercept leg . For example for a 40 ft about 12 m spacing between vertical portions of legs and about 200 ft about 61 m is needed to allow the bend of leg to intercept leg . Coupling two legs may require a thinner contacting section than coupling three or more legs in the contacting section.

Coupling the diads to the secondaries of the delta three phase transformer isolates the diads from ground. Isolating the diads from ground inhibits leakage to the formation from the diads. Coupling the diads to different phases of the delta three phase transformer also inhibits leakage between the heating legs of the diads in the formation.

In some embodiments diads are used for treating formations using triangular or hexagonal heater patterns. depicts an embodiment of groups of diads in a hexagonal pattern. Heaters may be placed at the vertices of each of the hexagons in the hexagonal pattern. Each group of diads enclosed by dashed circles may be coupled to a separate three phase transformer.

In certain embodiments exposed metal heating elements are used in substantially horizontal sections of u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may be used in tar sands formations oil shale formation or other formations with relatively thin hydrocarbon layers. Tar sands or thin oil shale formations may have thin shallow layers that are more easily and uniformly heated using heaters placed in substantially u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also be used to process formations with thick hydrocarbon layers in formations. In some embodiments substantially u shaped wellbores are used to access rich layers in a thick hydrocarbon formation.

Heaters in substantially u shaped wellbores may have long lengths compared to heaters in vertical wellbores because horizontal heating sections do not have problems with creep or hanging stress encountered with vertical heating elements. Substantially u shaped wellbores may make use of natural seals in the formation and or the limited thickness of the hydrocarbon layer. For example the wellbores may be placed above or below natural seals in the formation without punching large numbers of holes in the natural seals as would be needed with vertically oriented wellbores. Using substantially u shaped wellbores instead of vertical wellbores may also reduce the number of wells needed to treat a surface footprint of the formation. Using less wells reduces capital costs for equipment and reduces the environmental impact of treating the formation by reducing the amount of wellbores on the surface and the amount of equipment on the surface. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also utilize a lower ratio of overburden section to heated section than vertical wellbores.

Substantially u shaped wellbores may allow for flexible placement of opening of the wellbores on the surface. Openings to the wellbores may be placed according to the surface topology of the formation. In certain embodiments the openings of wellbores are placed at geographically accessible locations such as topological highs for examples hills . For example the wellbore may have a first opening on a first topologic high and a second opening on a second topologic high and the wellbore crosses beneath a topologic low for example a valley with alluvial fill between the first and second topologic highs. This placement of the openings may avoid placing openings or equipment in topologic lows or other inaccessible locations. In addition the water level may not be artesian in topologically high areas. Wellbores may be drilled so that the openings are not located near environmentally sensitive areas such as but not limited to streams nesting areas or animal refuges.

In certain embodiments portions of heating elements are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal heating elements. In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal temperature limited heating elements. Heating elements may include ferromagnetic materials such as 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel like 410 stainless steel chromium stainless steels such as T P91 or T P92 409 stainless steel VM12 Vallourec and Mannesmann Tubes France or iron cobalt alloys for use as temperature limited heaters. In some embodiments heating elements are composite temperature limited heating elements such as 410 stainless steel and copper composite heating elements or 347H iron copper composite heating elements. Heating elements may have lengths of at least about 100 m at least about 500 m or at least about 1000 m up to lengths of about 6000 m.

Heating elements may be solid rods or tubulars. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements have diameters several times the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the solid rod heating elements may have diameters of 1.91 cm or larger for example 2.5 cm 3.2 cm 3.81 cm or 5.1 cm . In certain embodiments tubular heating elements have wall thicknesses of at least twice the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the tubular heating elements have outside diameters of between about 2.5 cm and about 15.2 cm and wall thickness in range between about 0.13 cm and about 1.01 cm.

In certain embodiments tubular heating elements allow fluids to be convected through the tubular heating elements. Fluid flowing through the tubular heating elements may be used to preheat the tubular heating elements to initially heat the formation and or to recover heat from the formation after heating is completed for the in situ heat treatment process. Fluids that may flow through the tubular heating elements include but are not limited to air water steam helium carbon dioxide or other fluids. In some embodiments a hot fluid such as carbon dioxide or helium flows through the tubular heating elements to provide heat to the formation. The hot fluid may be used to provide heat to the formation before electrical heating is used to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments the hot fluid is used to provide heat in addition to electrical heating. Using the hot fluid to provide heat to the formation in addition to providing electrical heating may be less expensive than using electrical heating alone to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments water and or steam flows through the tubular heating element to recover heat from the formation. The heated water and or steam may be used for solution mining and or other processes.

Transition sections may couple heating elements to sections . In certain embodiments transition sections include material that has a high electrical conductivity but is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over copper. In an embodiment transition sections include a composite of stainless steel clad over copper. Transition sections inhibit overheating of copper and or insulation in sections .

As depicted in cables may be coupled to transformer and one or more heater units such as the heater unit including heaters A B C. Cables may carry a large amount of power. In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. . Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer to the heaters. In some embodiments cables may be made of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes as conductors may have about 1000 times the conductivity of copper for the same diameter. Also carbon nanotubes may not require refrigeration during use.

In certain embodiments bus bar A is coupled to first end portions of heaters A L and bus bar B is coupled to second end portions of heaters A L. Bus bars A B electrically couple heaters A L to cables and transformer . Bus bars A B distribute power to heaters A L. In certain embodiments bus bars A B are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. In some embodiments bus bars A B are made of superconducting material such as the superconductor material used in cables . In some embodiments bus bars A B may include carbon nanotube conductors.

As shown in heaters A L are coupled to a single transformer . In certain embodiments transformer is a source of time varying current. In certain embodiments transformer is an electrically isolated single phase transformer. In certain embodiments transformer provides power to heaters A L from an isolated secondary phase of the transformer. First end portions of heaters A L may be coupled to one side of transformer while second end portions of the heaters are coupled to the opposite side of the transformer. Transformer provides a substantially common voltage to the first end portions of heaters A L and a substantially common voltage to the second end portions of heaters A L. In certain embodiments transformer applies a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A L that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. For example a 660 V potential may be applied to the first end portions of heaters A L and a 660 V potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters at a selected point on the wave of time varying current such as AC or modulated DC . Thus the voltages at the two end portion of the heaters may be equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity with an average voltage that is substantially at ground potential.

Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A L produces voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. depicts a cross sectional representation along a vertical plane such as the plane A A shown in of substantially u shaped heaters in a hydrocarbon layer. The voltage potential at the cross sectional point shown in along the length of heater A is substantially the same as the voltage potential at the corresponding cross sectional points on heaters A L shown in . At lines equidistant between heater wellheads the voltage potential is approximately zero. Other wells such as production wells or monitoring wells may be located along these zero voltage potential lines if desired. Production wells located close to the overburden may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a vapor phase to the surface. Production wells located close to a bottom of the heated portion of the formation may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a liquid phase to the surface.

In certain embodiments the voltage potential at the midpoint of heaters A L is about zero. Having similar voltage potentials along the lengths of heaters A L inhibits current leakage between the heaters. Thus there is little or no current flow in the formation and the heaters may have long lengths as described above. Having the opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials at the end portions of the heaters also halves the voltage applied at either end portion of the heater versus having one end portion of the heater grounded and one end portion at full potential. Reducing halving the voltage potential applied to an end portion of the heater generally reduces current leakage reduces insulator requirements and or reduces arcing distances because of the lower voltage potential to ground applied at the end portions of the heaters.

In certain embodiments substantially vertical heaters are used to provide heat to the formation. Opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials as described above may be applied to the end portions of the substantially vertical heaters. depicts a side view representation of substantially vertical heaters coupled to a substantially horizontal wellbore. Heaters A B C D E F are located substantially vertical in hydrocarbon layer . First end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar A on a surface of the formation. Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar B in contacting section .

Bus bar B may be a bus bar located in a substantially horizontal wellbore in contacting section . Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F may be coupled to bus bar B by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to bus bar B for example by welding or brazing the containers to the bus bar end portions of heaters A B C D E F are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the heaters to the bus bar. The containers may be coupled to bus bar B by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in bus bar B or coupled to the outside of the bus bar and then brazing or welding the containers to the bus bar.

Bus bar A and bus bar B may be coupled to transformer with cables as described above. Transformer may provide voltages to bar A and bus bar B as described above for the embodiments depicted in . For example transformer may apply a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A F that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may produce voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may inhibit current leakage between the heaters and or into the formation.

In certain embodiments it may be advantageous to allow some current leakage into the formation during early stages of heating to heat the formation at a faster rate. Current leakage from the heaters into the formation electrically heats the formation directly. The formation is heated by direct electrical heating in addition to conductive heat provided by the heaters. The formation the hydrocarbon layer may have an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m. Direct electrical heating is achieved by having opposite potentials applied to adjacent heaters in the hydrocarbon layer. Current may be allowed to leak into the formation until a selected temperature is reached in the heaters or in the formation. The selected temperature may be below or near the temperature that water proximate one or more heaters boils off. After water boils off the hydrocarbon layer is substantially electrically isolated from the heaters and direct heating of the formation is inefficient. After the selected temperature is reached the voltage potential is applied in the opposite polarity and substantially equal magnitude manner described above for so that adjacent heaters will have the same voltage potential along their lengths.

Current is allowed to leak into the formation by reversing the polarity of one or more heaters shown in so that a first group of heaters has a positive voltage potential at first location and a second group of heaters has a negative voltage potential at the first location. The first end portions at first location of a first group of heaters for example heaters A B D E G H J K depicted in are applied with a positive voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to a negative voltage potential applied to the second end portions at second location of the first group of heaters. The first end portions at first location of the second group of heaters for example heaters C F L are applied with a negative voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to the positive voltage potential applied to the first end portions of the first group of heaters. Similarly the second end portions at second location of the second group of heaters are applied with a positive voltage potential substantially equal in magnitude to the negative potential applied to the second end portions of the first group of heaters. After the selected temperature is reached the first end portions of both groups of heaters are applied with voltage potential that is opposite in polarity and substantially similar in magnitude to the voltage potential applied to the second end portions of both groups of heaters.

In some embodiments the heating elements have a thin electrically insulating layer described above to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. The thin electrically insulating layer may inhibit heating elements of a three phase heater from leaking current between the elements from leaking current into the formation and from leaking current to other heaters in the formation. Thus the three phase heater may have a longer heater length.

In certain embodiments a heater is electrically isolated from the formation because the heater has little or no voltage potential on the outside of the heater. depicts an embodiment of a substantially u shaped heater that electrically isolates itself from the formation. Heater has a first end portion at a first opening on surface and a second end portion at a second opening on the surface. In some embodiments heater has only the first end portion at the surface with the second end of the heater located in hydrocarbon layer the heater is a single ended heater . depict embodiments of single ended heaters that electrically isolate themselves from the formation. In certain embodiments single ended heater has an elongated portion that is substantially horizontal in hydrocarbon layer as shown in . In some embodiments single ended heater has an elongated portion with an orientation other than substantially horizontal in hydrocarbon layer . For example the single ended heater may have an elongated portion that is oriented 15 off horizontal in the hydrocarbon layer.

As shown in heater includes heating element located in hydrocarbon layer . Heating element may be a ferromagnetic conduit heating element or ferromagnetic tubular heating element. In certain embodiments heating element is a temperature limited heater tubular heating element. In certain embodiments heating element is a 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel tubular such as a 410 stainless steel tubular a T P91 stainless steel tubular or a T P92 stainless steel tubular. In certain embodiments heating element includes ferromagnetic material with a wall thickness of at least about one skin depth of the ferromagnetic material at 25 C. In some embodiments heating element includes ferromagnetic material with a wall thickness of at least about two times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material at 25 C. at least about three times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material at 25 C. or at least about four times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material at 25 C.

Heating element is coupled to one or more sections . Sections are located in overburden . Sections include higher electrical conductivity materials such as copper or aluminum. In certain embodiments sections are copper clad inside carbon steel.

Center conductor is positioned inside heating element . In some embodiments heating element and center conductor are placed or installed in the formation by unspooling the heating element and the center conductor from one or more spools while they are placed into the formation. In some embodiments heating element and center conductor are coupled together on a single spool and unspooled as a single system with the center conductor inside the heating element. In some embodiments heating element and center conductor are located on separate spools and the center conductor is positioned inside the heating element after the heating element is placed in the formation.

In certain embodiments center conductor is located at or near a center of heating element . Center conductor may be substantially electrically isolated from heating element along a length of the center conductor for example the length of the center conductor in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments center conductor is separated from heating element by one or more electrically insulating centralizers. The centralizers may include silicon nitride or another electrically insulating material. The centralizers may inhibit electrical contact between center conductor and heating element so that for example arcing or shorting between the center conductor and the heating element is inhibited. In some embodiments center conductor is a conductor for example a solid conductor or a tubular conductor so that the heater is in a conductor in conduit configuration.

In certain embodiments center conductor is a copper rod or copper tubular. In some embodiments center conductor and or heating element has a thin electrically insulating layer to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. The thin electrically insulating layer may inhibit heating elements of a three phase heater from leaking current between the elements from leaking current into the formation and from leaking current to other heaters in the formation. Thus the three phase heater may have a longer heater length.

In certain embodiments center conductor is an insulated conductor. The insulated conductor may include an electrically conductive core inside an electrically conductive sheath with electrical insulation between the core and the sheath. In certain embodiments the insulated conductor includes a copper core inside a non ferromagnetic stainless steel for example 347 stainless steel sheath with magnesium oxide insulation between the core and the sheath. The core may be used to conduct electrical current through the insulated conductor. In some embodiments the insulated conductor is placed inside heating element without centralizers or spacers between the insulated conductor and the heating element. The sheath and the electrical insulation of the insulated conductor may electrically insulate the core from heating element if the center conductor and the heating element touch. Thus the core and heating element are inhibited from electrically shorting to each other. The insulated conductor or another solid center conductor may be inhibited from being crushed or deformed by heating element . In certain embodiments one end portion of center conductor is electrically coupled to one end portion of heating element at surface using electrical coupling as shown in . In some embodiments the end of center conductor is electrically coupled to the end of heating element in hydrocarbon layer using electrical coupling as shown in . Thus center conductor is electrically coupled to heating element in a series configuration in the embodiments depicted in . In certain embodiments center conductor is the insulated conductor and the core of the insulated conductor is electrically coupled to heating element in the series configuration. Center conductor is a return electrical conductor for heating element so that current in the center conductor flows in an opposite direction from current in the heating element as represented by arrows . The electromagnetic field generated by current flow in center conductor substantially confines the flow of electrons and heat generation to the inside of heating element for example the inside wall of the heating element below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the heating element. Thus the outside of heating element is at substantially zero potential and the heating element is electrically isolated from the formation and any adjacent heater or heating element at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material for example at 25 C. . Having the outside of heating element at substantially zero potential and the heating element electrically isolated from the formation and any adjacent heater or heating element allows for long length heaters to be used in hydrocarbon layer without significant electrical current losses to the hydrocarbon layer. For example heaters with lengths of at least about 100 m at least about 500 m or at least about 1000 m may be used in hydrocarbon layer .

During application of electrical current to heating element and center conductor heat is generated by the heater. In certain embodiments heating element generates a majority or all of the heat output of the heater. For example when electrical current flows through ferromagnetic material in heating element and copper or another low resistivity material in center conductor the heating element generates a majority or all of the heat output of the heater. Generating a majority of the heat in the outer conductor heating element instead of center conductor may increase the efficiency of heat transfer to the formation by allowing direct heat transfer from the heat generating element heating element to the formation and may reduce heat losses across heater for example heat losses between the center conductor and the outer conductor if the center conductor is the heat generating element . Generating heat in heating element instead of center conductor also increases the heat generating surface area of heater . Thus for the same operating temperature of heater more heat can be provided to the formation using the outer conductor heating element as the heat generating element rather than center conductor .

In some embodiments a fluid flows through heater represented by arrows in to preheat the formation and or to recover heat from the heating element. In the embodiment depicted in fluid flows from one end of heater to the other end of the heater inside and through heating element and outside center conductor as shown by arrows . In the embodiment depicted in fluid flows into heater through center conductor which is a tubular conductor as shown by arrows . Center conductor includes openings at the end of the center conductor to allow fluid to exit the center conductor. Openings may be perforations or other orifices that allow fluid to flow into and or out of center conductor . Fluid then returns to the surface inside heating element and outside center conductor as shown by arrows .

Fluid flowing inside heater represented by arrows in may be used to preheat the heater to initially heat the formation and or to recover heat from the formation after heating is completed for the in situ heat treatment process. Fluids that may flow through the heater include but are not limited to air water steam helium carbon dioxide or other high heat capacity fluids. In some embodiments a hot fluid such as carbon dioxide helium or DOWTHERM The Dow Chemical Company Midland Mich. U.S.A. flows through the tubular heating elements to provide heat to the formation. The hot fluid may be used to provide heat to the formation before electrical heating is used to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments the hot fluid is used to provide heat in addition to electrical heating. Using the hot fluid to provide heat to or preheat the formation in addition to providing electrical heating may be less expensive than using electrical heating alone to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments water and or steam flows through the tubular heating element to recover heat from the formation after in situ heat treatment of the formation. The heated water and or steam may be used for solution mining and or other processes.

Heating element A is placed in opening A in hydrocarbon layer A. Overburden casing is placed along the relatively vertical walls of openings in hydrocarbon layer B. Overburden casing inhibits heat transfer to hydrocarbon layer B while heat is provided to hydrocarbon layer A by heating element A. Heating element A is used to provide heat to hydrocarbon layer A. Formation fluids such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from hydrocarbon layer A.

Heat may be provided to hydrocarbon layer A by heating element A for a selected length of time. The selected length of time may be based on a variety of factors including but not limited to formation characteristics present or future economic factors or capital costs. For example for an oil shale formation hydrocarbon layer A may have a richness of about 0.12 L kg 30.5 gals ton so the layer is heated for about 25 years. Production of formation fluids from hydrocarbon layer A may continue from the layer until production slows down to an uneconomical rate.

After hydrocarbon layer A is heated for the selected time heating element A is turned off. Heating element A may be pulled firmly for example yanked upwards so that the heating element breaks off at links . Links may be weak links designed to pull apart when a selected or sufficient amount of pulling force is applied to the links. The upper portions of heating element A are then pulled out of the formation and the substantially horizontal portion of heating element A is left in opening A as shown in . In some embodiments only one link may be broken so that the upper portion above the one link can be removed and the remaining portions of the heater can be removed by pulling on the opposite end of the heater. Thus the entire length of heating element A may be removed from the formation.

After upper portions of heating element A are removed from openings plugs may be placed into openings at a selected location in hydrocarbon layer B as depicted in . In certain embodiments plugs are placed into openings at or near impermeable zone . Packing may be placed into openings above plugs . In some embodiments packing is filled into openings without plugs in the openings.

After plugs and or packing is set into place in openings substantially horizontal opening B may be formed in hydrocarbon layer B through casing . Heating element B is placed into opening B. Heating element B is used to provide heat to hydrocarbon layer B. Formation fluids such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from hydrocarbon layer B.

Heating hydrocarbon layers A B in the time sequenced manner described above may be more economical than producing from only one layer or using vertical heaters to provide heat to the layers simultaneously. Using relatively vertical openings to access both hydrocarbon layers at different times may save on capital costs associated with forming openings in the formation and providing surface facilities to power the heating elements. Heating hydrocarbon layer A first before heating hydrocarbon layer B may improve the economics of treating the formation for example the net present value of a project to treat the formation . In addition impermeable zone and packing may provide a seal for hydrocarbon layer A after heating and production from the layer. This seal may be useful for abandonment of the hydrocarbon layer after treating the hydrocarbon layer.

In certain embodiments portions of the wellbore that extend through the overburden include casings. The casings may include materials that inhibit inductive effects in the casings Inhibiting inductive effects in the casings may inhibit induced currents in the casing and or reduce heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments the overburden casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated PVC CPVC high density polyethylene HDPE or other high temperature plastics. HDPEs with working temperatures in a usable range include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. . The overburden casings may be made of materials that are spoolable so that the overburden casings can be spooled into the wellbore. In some embodiments overburden casings may include non magnetic metals such as aluminum or non magnetic alloys such as manganese steels having at least 10 manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 aluminum or austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel. In some embodiments overburden casings may include carbon steel or other ferromagnetic material coupled on the inside diameter to a highly conductive non ferromagnetic metal for example copper or aluminum to inhibit inductive effects or skin effects. In some embodiments overburden casings are made of inexpensive materials that may left in the formation sacrificial casings .

In certain embodiments wellheads for the wellbores may be made of one or more non ferromagnetic materials. The wellheads may include fiberglass PVC CPVC HDPE and or non magnetic alloys or metals. Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead may inhibit undesired heating of components in the wellhead. Ferromagnetic materials used in the wellhead may be electrically and or thermally insulated from other components of the wellhead. In some embodiments an inert gas for example nitrogen or argon is purged inside the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In some embodiments ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead are electrically coupled to a non ferromagnetic material for example copper to inhibit skin effect heat generation in the ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead. The non ferromagnetic material is in electrical contact with the ferromagnetic material so that current flows through the non ferromagnetic material. For example copper may be plasma sprayed coated or lined on the inside and or outside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments a non ferromagnetic material such as copper is welded brazed clad or otherwise electrically coupled to the inside and or outside walls of the wellhead. For example copper may be swaged out to line the inside walls in the wellhead. Copper may be liquid nitrogen cooled and then allowed to expand to contact and swage against the inside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments the copper is hydraulically expanded to contact against the inside walls of the wellhead.

In some embodiments two or more substantially horizontal wellbores are branched off of a first substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from a first location on a surface of the formation. The substantially horizontal wellbores may be substantially parallel through a hydrocarbon layer. The substantially horizontal wellbores may reconnect at a second substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards at a second location on the surface of the formation. Having multiple wellbores branching off of a single substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from the surface reduces the number of openings made at the surface of the formation.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater is utilized for heavy oil applications for example treatment of relatively permeable formations or tar sands formations . A temperature limited heater may provide a relatively low Curie temperature so that a maximum average operating temperature of the heater is less than 350 C. 300 C. 250 C. 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. In an embodiment for example for a tar sands formation a maximum temperature of the heater is less than about 250 C. to inhibit olefin generation and production of other cracked products. In some embodiments a maximum temperature of the heater above about 250 C. is used to produce lighter hydrocarbon products. For example the maximum temperature of the heater may be at or less than about 500 C.

A heater may heat a volume of formation adjacent to a production wellbore a near production wellbore region so that the temperature of fluid in the production wellbore and in the volume adjacent to the production wellbore is less than the temperature that causes degradation of the fluid. The heat source may be located in the production wellbore or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments the heat source is a temperature limited heater. In some embodiments two or more heat sources may supply heat to the volume. Heat from the heat source may reduce the viscosity of crude oil in or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments heat from the heat source mobilizes fluids in or near the production wellbore and or enhances the radial flow of fluids to the production wellbore. In some embodiments reducing the viscosity of crude oil allows or enhances gas lifting of heavy oil approximately at most 10 API gravity oil or intermediate gravity oil approximately 12 to 20 API gravity oil from the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the initial API gravity of oil in the formation is at most 10 at most 20 at most 25 or at most 30 . In certain embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.05 Pa s 50 cp . In some embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.10 Pa s 100 cp at least 0.15 Pa s 150 cp or at least at least 0.20 Pa s 200 cp . Large amounts of natural gas may have to be utilized to provide gas lift of oil with viscosities above 0.05 Pa s. Reducing the viscosity of oil at or near the production wellbore in the formation to a viscosity of 0.05 Pa s 50 cp 0.03 Pa s 30 cp 0.02 Pa s 20 cp 0.01 Pa s 10 cp or less down to 0.001 Pa s 1 cp or lower lowers the amount of natural gas needed to lift oil from the formation. In some embodiments reduced viscosity oil is produced by other methods such as pumping.

The rate of production of oil from the formation may be increased by raising the temperature at or near a production wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the oil in the formation in and adjacent to the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the rate of production of oil from the formation is increased by 2 times 3 times 4 times or greater up to 20 times over standard cold production which has no external heating of formation during production. Certain formations may be more economically viable for enhanced oil production using the heating of the near production wellbore region. Formations that have a cold production rate approximately between 0.05 m day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m day per meter of wellbore length may have significant improvements in production rate using heating to reduce the viscosity in the near production wellbore region. In some formations production wells up to 775 m up to 1000 m or up to 1500 m in length are used. For example production wells between 450 m and 775 m in length are used between 550 m and 800 m are used or between 650 m and 900 m are used. Thus a significant increase in production is achievable in some formations. Heating the near production wellbore region may be used in formations where the cold production rate is not between 0.05 m day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m day per meter of wellbore length but heating such formations may not be as economically favorable. Higher cold production rates may not be significantly increased by heating the near wellbore region while lower production rates may not be increased to an economically useful value.

Using the temperature limited heater to reduce the viscosity of oil at or near the production well inhibits problems associated with non temperature limited heaters and heating the oil in the formation due to hot spots. One possible problem is that non temperature limited heaters can cause coking of oil at or near the production well if the heater overheats the oil because the heaters are at too high a temperature. Higher temperatures in the production well may also cause brine to boil in the well which may lead to scale formation in the well. Non temperature limited heaters that reach higher temperatures may also cause damage to other wellbore components for example screens used for sand control pumps or valves . Hot spots may be caused by portions of the formation expanding against or collapsing on the heater. In some embodiments the heater either the temperature limited heater or another type of non temperature limited heater has sections that are lower because of sagging over long heater distances. These lower sections may sit in heavy oil or bitumen that collects in lower portions of the wellbore. At these lower sections the heater may develop hot spots due to coking of the heavy oil or bitumen. A standard non temperature limited heater may overheat at these hot spots thus producing a non uniform amount of heat along the length of the heater. Using the temperature limited heater may inhibit overheating of the heater at hot spots or lower sections and provide more uniform heating along the length of the wellbore.

In some embodiments oil or bitumen cokes in a perforated liner or screen in a heater production wellbore for example coke may form between the heater and the liner or between the liner and the formation . Oil or bitumen may also coke in a toe section of a heel and toe heater production wellbore as shown in and described below for . A temperature limited heater may limit a temperature of a heater production wellbore below a coking temperature to inhibit coking in the well so that the wellbore does not plug up.

In certain embodiments fluids in the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons are produced with little or no pyrolyzation of hydrocarbons in the formation. In certain embodiments the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons is a tar sands formation. For example the formation may be a tar sands formation such as the Athabasca tar sands formation in Alberta Canada or a carbonate formation such as the Grosmont carbonate formation in Alberta Canada. The fluids produced from the formation are mobilized fluids. Producing mobilized fluids may be more economical than producing pyrolyzed fluids from the tar sands formation. Producing mobilized fluids may also increase the total amount of hydrocarbons produced from the tar sands formation.

In heaters are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In and heaters are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer that repeats vertically to encompass a majority or all of the hydrocarbon layer. In the alternating triangular pattern of heaters in hydrocarbon layer repeats uninterrupted across shale break . In heaters may be equidistantly spaced from each other. In the embodiments depicted in the number of vertical rows of heaters depends on factors such as but not limited to the desired spacing between the heaters the thickness of hydrocarbon layer and or the number and location of shale breaks . In some embodiments heaters are arranged in other patterns. For example heaters may be arranged in patterns such as but not limited to hexagonal patterns square patterns or rectangular patterns.

In the embodiments depicted in heaters provide heat that mobilizes hydrocarbons reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heaters provide heat that reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer below about 0.50 Pa s 500 cp below about 0.10 Pa s 100 cp or below about 0.05 Pa s 50 cp . The spacing between heaters and or the heat output of the heaters may be designed and or controlled to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer to desirable values. Heat provided by heaters may be controlled so that little or no pyrolyzation occurs in hydrocarbon layer . Superposition of heat between the heaters may create one or more drainage paths for example paths for flow of fluids between the heaters. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located proximate heaters so that heat from the heaters superimposes over the production wells. The superimposition of heat from heaters over production wells A and or production wells B creates one or more drainage paths from the heaters to the production wells. In certain embodiments one or more of the drainage paths converge. For example the drainage paths may converge at or near a bottommost heater and or the drainage paths may converge at or near production wells A and or production wells B. Fluids mobilized in hydrocarbon layer tend to flow towards the bottommost heaters production wells A and or production wells B in the hydrocarbon layer because of gravity and the heat and pressure gradients established by the heaters and or the production wells. The drainage paths and or the converged drainage paths allow production wells A and or production wells B to collect mobilized fluids in hydrocarbon layer .

In certain embodiments hydrocarbon layer has sufficient permeability to allow mobilized fluids to drain to production wells A and or production wells B. For example hydrocarbon layer may have a permeability of at least about 0.1 darcy at least about 1 darcy at least about 10 darcy or at least about 100 darcy. In some embodiments hydrocarbon layer has a relatively large vertical permeability to horizontal permeability ratio K K . For example hydrocarbon layer may have a K Kratio between about 0.01 and about 2 between about 0.1 and about 1 or between about 0.3 and about 0.7.

In certain embodiments fluids are produced through production wells A located near heaters in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments fluids are produced through production wells B located below and approximately midway between heaters in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . At least a portion of production wells A and or production wells B may be oriented substantially horizontal in hydrocarbon layer as shown in the production wells have horizontal portions that go into and out of the page . Production wells A and or B may be located proximate lower portion heaters or the bottommost heaters.

In some embodiments production wells A are positioned substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters in hydrocarbon layer . Production wells A may be located below heaters at the bottom vertex of a pattern of the heaters for example at the bottom vertex of the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in . Locating production wells A substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters may provide efficient collection of mobilized fluids in hydrocarbon layer .

In certain embodiments the bottommost heaters are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located at a distance from the bottommost heaters that allows heat from the heaters to superimpose over the production wells but at a distance from the heaters that inhibits coking at the production wells. Production wells A and or production wells B may be located a distance from the nearest heater for example the bottommost heater of at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters for example the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in . In some embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located a distance from the nearest heater of at most at most or at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters. Production wells A and or production wells B may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 1 m and about 5 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments at least some production wells A are located substantially vertically below heaters near shale break as depicted in . Production wells A may be located between heaters and shale break to produce fluids that flow and collect above the shale break. Shale break may be an impermeable barrier in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments shale break has a thickness between about 1 m and about 6 m between about 2 m and about 5 m or between about 3 m and about 4 m. Production wells A between heaters and shale break may produce fluids from the upper portion of hydrocarbon layer above the shale break and production wells A below the bottommost heaters in the hydrocarbon layer may produce fluids from the lower portion of the hydrocarbon layer below the shale break as depicted in . In some embodiments two or more shale breaks may exist in a hydrocarbon layer. In such an embodiment production wells are placed at or near each of the shale breaks to produce fluids flowing and collecting above the shale breaks.

In some embodiments shale break breaks down is desiccated as the shale break is heated by heaters on either side of the shale break. As shale break breaks down the permeability of the shale break increases and the shale break allows fluids to flow through the shale break. Once fluids are able to flow through shale break production wells above the shale break may not be needed for production as fluids can flow to production wells at or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer and be produced there.

In certain embodiments the bottommost heaters above shale break are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the shale break between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the shale break or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters above shale break between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from shale break between about 1 m and about 5 m from the shale break or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the shale break.

In some embodiments heat is provided in production wells A and or production wells B depicted in . Providing heat in production wells A and or production wells B may maintain and or enhance the mobility of the fluids in the production wells. Heat provided in production wells A and or production wells B may superpose with heat from heaters to create the flow path from the heaters to the production wells. In some embodiments production wells A and or production wells B include a pump to remove fluids to the surface of the formation. In some embodiments the viscosity of fluids oil in production wells A and or production wells B is lowered using heaters and or diluent injection for example using a conduit in the production wells for injecting the diluent .

In certain embodiments in situ heat treatment of the relatively permeable formation containing hydrocarbons for example the tar sands formation includes heating the formation to visbreaking temperatures. For example the formation may be heated to temperatures between about 100 C. and 260 C. between about 150 C. and about 250 C. or between about 200 C. and about 240 C. At visbreaking temperatures fluids in the formation have a reduced viscosity versus their initial viscosity at ambient formation temperature that allows fluids to flow in the formation. The visbroken fluids may have low API gravities for example at most about 10 about 12 or about 15 API gravity .

In some embodiments heaters in the formation are operated at full power output to heat the formation to visbreaking temperatures. Operating at full power may rapidly increase the pressure in the formation. In certain embodiments fluids are produced from the formation to maintain a pressure in the formation below a selected pressure as the temperature of the formation increases to visbreaking temperatures. In some embodiments the selected pressure is a fracture pressure of the formation. In certain embodiments the selected pressure is between about 1000 kPa and about 15000 kPa between about 2000 kPa and about 10000 kPa or between about 2500 kPa and about 5000 kPa. The fluids produced from the formation may be visbroken and or mobilized fluids. Maintaining the pressure as close to the fracture pressure as possible may minimize the number of production wells needed for producing fluids from the formation because fluids are more mobile at higher pressures.

In certain embodiments after the formation reaches visbreaking temperatures the pressure in the formation is reduced. The pressure may be reduced by producing fluids for example visbroken fluids and or mobilized fluids from the formation. In some embodiments the pressure is reduced below a pressure at which fluids coke in the formation to inhibit coking at pyrolysis temperatures. For example the pressure is reduced to a pressure below about 1000 kPa below about 800 kPa or below about 700 kPa. The pressure may be reduced to inhibit coking of asphaltenes or other large hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments the pressure may be maintained below a pressure at which water passes through a liquid phase at downhole formation temperatures to inhibit liquid water and dolomite reactions. After reducing the pressure in the formation the temperature may be increased to pyrolysis temperatures to begin pyrolyzation and or upgrading of fluids in the formation. The pyrolyzed and or upgraded fluids may be produced from the formation.

The amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures the amount of fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures and the amount of upgraded fluids produced may be varied to control the quality and amount of fluids produced from the formation and the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation. For example producing more fluid during the early stages of treatment for example producing at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures may increase the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation while reducing the overall quality lowering the overall API gravity of fluid produced from the formation. The overall quality is reduced because more heavy hydrocarbons are produced by producing more fluids at the lower temperatures. Producing less fluids at the lower temperatures may increase the overall quality of the fluids produced from the formation but may lower the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation.

In certain embodiments the formation is heated using isolated cells of heaters cells or sections of the formation that are not interconnected for fluid flow . The isolated cells may be created by using larger heater spacings in the formation. For example large heater spacings may be used in the embodiments depicted in . These isolated cells may be produced during early stages of heating for example at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures . Because the cells are isolated from other cells in the formation the pressures in the isolated cells are high and more liquids are producible from the isolated cells. Thus more liquids may be produced from the formation and a higher total recovery of hydrocarbons may be reached. During later stages of heating the heat gradient will interconnect the isolated cells and pressures in the formation will drop.

In certain embodiments the heat gradient in the formation is modified so that a gas cap is created at or near an upper portion of the hydrocarbon layer. For example the heat gradient made by heaters depicted in the embodiments depicted in may be modified to create the gas cap at or near overburden of hydrocarbon layer . The gas cap may push or drive liquids to the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer so that more liquids may be produced from the formation.

In certain embodiments fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures and or fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures are blended with diluent to produce fluids with lower viscosities. In some embodiments the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from another portion of the formation or another formation. In certain embodiments the amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures and or fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures that are blended with upgraded fluids from the formation is adjusted to create a fluid suitable for transportation and or use in a refinery. The amount of blending may be adjusted so that the fluid has chemical and physical stability. Maintaining the chemical and physical stability of the fluid may allow the fluid to be transported reduce pre treatment processes at a refinery and or reduce or eliminate the need for adjusting the refinery process to compensate for the fluid.

In certain embodiments formation conditions for example pressure and temperature and or fluid production are controlled to produce fluids with selected properties. For example formation conditions and or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with a selected API gravity and or a selected viscosity. The selected API gravity and or selected viscosity may be produced by combining fluids produced at different formation conditions for example combining fluids produced at different temperatures during the treatment as described above . As an example formation conditions and or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with an API gravity of about 19 and a viscosity of about 0.35 Pa s 350 cp at 19 C.

In some embodiments formation conditions and or fluid production is controlled so that water for example connate water is recondensed in the treatment area. Recondensing water in the treatment area keeps the heat of condensation in the formation. In addition having liquid water in the formation may increase mobility of liquid hydrocarbons oil in the formation. Liquid water may wet rock or other strata in the formation by occupying pores or corners in the strata and creating a slick surface that moves liquid hydrocarbons more readily through the formation.

In certain embodiments a drive process for example a steam injection process such as cyclic steam injection a steam assisted gravity drainage process SAGD a solvent injection process or a carbon dioxide injection process is used to treat the tar sands formation in addition to the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments heaters are used to create high permeability zones or injection zones in the formation for the drive process. Heaters may be used to create a mobilization geometry or production network in the formation to allow fluids to flow through the formation during the drive process. For example heaters may be used to create drainage paths between the heaters and production wells for the drive process. In some embodiments the heaters are used to provide heat during the drive process. The amount of heat provided by the heaters may be small compared to the heat input from the drive process for example the heat input from steam injection .

In some embodiments the in situ heat treatment process may provide less heat to the formation for example use a wider heat spacing if the in situ heat treatment process is followed by the drive process. The drive process may be used to increase the amount of heat provided to the formation to compensate for the loss of heat injection.

In some embodiments the drive process is used to treat the formation and produce hydrocarbons from the formation. The drive process may recover a low amount of oil in place from the formation for example less than 20 recovery of oil in place from the formation . The in situ heat treatment process may be used following the drive process to increase the recovery of oil in place from the formation. In some embodiments the drive process preheats the formation for the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process a significant time after the formation has been treated using the drive process. For example the in situ heat treatment process is used 1 year 2 years or 3 years after a formation has been treated using the drive process. The in situ heat treatment process may be used on formations that have been left dormant after the drive process treatment because further hydrocarbon production using the drive process is not possible and or not economically feasible on the formation. In some embodiments the formation remains at least somewhat preheated from the drive process even after the significant time.

In some embodiments heaters are used to preheat the formation for the drive process. For example heaters may be used to create injectivity in the formation for a drive fluid. The heaters may create high permeability zones or injection zones in the formation for the drive process. In certain embodiments heaters are used to create injectivity in formations with little or no initial injectivity for example karsted formations such as the Grosmont formation in Alberta Canada . Heating the formation may create a mobilization geometry or production network in the formation to allow fluids to flow through the formation for the drive process. For example heaters may be used to create a fluid production network between a horizontal heater and a vertical production well. The heaters used to preheat the formation for the drive process may also be used to provide heat during the drive process.

The vertical location of heaters with respect to injection wells and production wells depends on for example the vertical permeability of the formation. In formations with at least some vertical permeability injected steam will rise to the top of the permeable layer in the formation. In such formations heaters may be located near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer as shown in . In formations with very low vertical permeabilities more than one horizontal heater may be used with the heaters stacked substantially vertically or with heaters at varying depths in the hydrocarbon layer for example heater patterns as shown in . The vertical spacing between the horizontal heaters in such formations may correspond to the distance between the heaters and the injection wells. Heaters are located in the vicinity of injection wells and or production wells so that sufficient energy is delivered by the heaters to provide flow rates for the drive process that are economically viable. The spacing between heaters and injection wells or production wells may be varied to provide an economically viable drive process. The amount of preheating may also be varied to provide an economically viable process.

Some embodiments of formations with little or no initial injectivity such as karsted formations or karsted layers in formations may have tight vugs in one or more layers of the formations. The tight vugs may be vugs filled with viscous fluids such as bitumen or heavy oil. In some embodiments the vugs have a porosity of at least about 20 porosity units at least about 30 porosity units or at least about 35 porosity units. The formation may have a porosity of at most about 15 porosity units at most about 10 porosity units or at most about 5 porosity units. The tight vugs inhibit steam or other fluids from being injected into the formation or the layers with tight vugs. In certain embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process. Heating of these formations or layers may decrease the viscosity of the fluids in the tight vugs and allow the fluids to drain for example mobilize the fluids .

In certain embodiments only the karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process. Other non karsted layers of the formation may be used as seals for the in situ heat treatment process. For example in the Grosmont formation the Grosmont 3 layer may be used as a bottom seal for in situ heat treatment of the Nisku and upper Ireton layers.

In some embodiments the drive process is used after the in situ heat treatment of the karsted formation or karsted layers. In some embodiments heaters are used to preheat the karsted formation or karsted layers to create infectivity in the formation.

In certain embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures below the decomposition temperature of rock for example dolomite in the formation for example temperatures at most about 407 C. . In some embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures above the decomposition temperature of dolomite in the formation. At temperatures above the dolomite decomposition temperature the dolomite may decompose to produce carbon dioxide. The decomposition of the dolomite and the carbon dioxide production may create permeability in the formation and mobilize viscous fluids in the formation. In some embodiments the produced carbon dioxide is maintained in the formation to produce a gas cap in the formation. The carbon dioxide may be allowed to rise to the upper portions of the karsted layers to produce the gas cap.

In some embodiments heaters are used to produce and or maintain the gas cap in the formation for the in situ heat treatment process and or the drive process. The gas cap may drive fluids from upper portions to lower portions of the formation and or from portions of the formation towards portions of the formation at lower pressures for example portions with production wells . In some embodiments little or no heating is provided in the portions of the formation with the gas cap. In some embodiments heaters in the gas cap are turned down and or off after formation of the gas cap. Using less heating in the gas cap may reduce the energy input into the formation and increase the efficiency of the in situ heat treatment process and or the drive process. In some embodiments production wells and or heater wells that are located in the gas cap portion of the formation may be used for injection of fluid for example steam to maintain the gas cap.

In some embodiments the production front of the drive process follows behind the heat front of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments areas behind the production front are further heated to produce more fluids from the formation. Further heating behind the production front may also maintain the gas cap behind the production front and or maintain quality in the production front of the drive process.

In certain embodiments the drive process is used before the in situ heat treatment of the formation. In some embodiments the drive process is used to mobilize fluids in a first section of the formation. The mobilized fluids may then be pushed into a second section by heating the first section with heaters. Fluids may be produced from the second section. In some embodiments the fluids in the second section are pyrolyzed and or upgraded using the heaters.

In some embodiments the drive process is used to create a gas cushion or pressure sink before the in situ heat treatment process in formations with low permeabilities. The gas cushion may be created by fracturing the formation during the drive process. The gas cushion may inhibit pressures from increasing to quickly to fracture pressure during the in situ heat treatment process. The gas cushion may provide a path for gases to escape or travel during early stages of heating during the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments the drive process for example the steam injection process is used to mobilize fluids before the in situ heat treatment process. Steam injection may be used to get hydrocarbons oil away from rock or other strata in the formation. The steam injection may mobilize the oil without heating the rock.

In some embodiments injection of a fluid for example steam or carbon dioxide may consume heat in the formation and cool the formation depending on the pressure in the formation. In some embodiments the injected fluid is used to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used in surface processing of fluids and or to preheat other portions of the formation using the drive process.

Heaters are used to heat the second portion of hydrocarbon layer to mobilization visbreaking and or pyrolysis temperatures. Second hydrocarbons are produced from the second portion through production well B. In some embodiments the second hydrocarbons include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments the second hydrocarbons have an API gravity of at least 15 at least 20 or at least 25 .

In some embodiments the first portion of hydrocarbon layer is treated using heaters after the steam injection process. Heaters may be used to increase the temperature of the first portion and or treat the first portion using an in situ heat treatment process. Second hydrocarbons including at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from the first portion through production well A.

In some embodiments the second portion of hydrocarbon layer is treated using the steam injection process before using heaters to treat the second portion. The steam injection process may be used to produce some fluids for example first hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons mobilized by the steam injection through production well B from the second portion and or preheat the second portion before using heaters . In some embodiments the steam injection process may be used after using heaters to treat the first portion and or the second portion.

Producing hydrocarbons through both processes increases the total recovery of hydrocarbons from hydrocarbon layer and may be more economical than using either process alone. In some embodiments the first portion is treated with the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process is completed. For example after the steam injection process no longer produces viable amounts of hydrocarbon from the first portion the in situ heat treatment process may be used on the first portion.

Steam is provided to injection well from facility . Facility is a steam and electricity cogeneration facility. Facility may burn hydrocarbons in generators to make electricity. Facility may burn gaseous and or liquid hydrocarbons to make electricity. The electricity generated is used to provide electrical power for heaters . Waste heat from the generators is used to make steam. In some embodiments some of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation are used to provide gas for heaters if the heaters utilize gas to provide heat to the formation. The amount of electricity and steam generated by facility may be controlled to vary the production rate and or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and or the second portion of hydrocarbon layer . The production rate and or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and or the second portion may be varied to produce a selected API gravity in a mixture made by blending the first hydrocarbons with the second hydrocarbons. The first hydrocarbon and the second hydrocarbons may be blended after production to produce the selected API gravity. The production from the first portion and or the second portion may be varied in response to changes in the marketplace for either first hydrocarbons second hydrocarbons and or a mixture of the first and second hydrocarbons.

First hydrocarbons produced from production well A and or second hydrocarbons produced from production well B may be used as fuel for facility . In some embodiments first hydrocarbons and or second hydrocarbons are treated for example removing undesirable products before being used as fuel for facility . The amount of first hydrocarbons and second hydrocarbons used as fuel for facility may be determined for example by economics for the overall process the marketplace for either first or second hydrocarbons availability of treatment facilities for either first or second hydrocarbons and or transportation facilities available for either first or second hydrocarbons. In some embodiments most or all the hydrocarbon gas produced from hydrocarbon layer is used as fuel for facility . Burning all the hydrocarbon gas in facility eliminates the need for treatment and or transportation of gases produced from hydrocarbon layer .

The produced first hydrocarbons and the second hydrocarbons may be treated and or blended in facility . In some embodiments the first and second hydrocarbons are blended to make a mixture that is transportable through a pipeline. In some embodiments the first and second hydrocarbons are blended to make a mixture that is useable as a feedstock for a refinery. The amount of first and second hydrocarbons produced may be varied based on changes in the requirements for treatment and or blending of the hydrocarbons. In some embodiments treated hydrocarbons are used in facility .

Conduit may be made from carbon steel or more corrosion resistant materials such as stainless steel. Conduit may include apparatus and mechanisms for gas lifting or pumping produced oil to the surface. For example conduit includes gas lift valves used in a gas lift process. Examples of gas lift control systems and valves are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 715 550 to Vinegar et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0036085 to Bass et al. and 2003 0038734 to Hirsch et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Conduit may include one or more openings perforations to allow fluid to flow into the production conduit. In certain embodiments the openings in conduit are in a portion of the conduit that remains below the liquid level in wellbore . For example the openings are in a horizontal portion of conduit .

Heater is located in conduit as shown in . In some embodiments heater is located outside conduit as shown in . The heater located outside the production conduit may be coupled strapped to the production conduit. In some embodiments more than one heater for example two three or four heaters are placed about conduit . The use of more than one heater may reduce bowing or flexing of the production conduit caused by heating on only one side of the production conduit. In an embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater. Heater provides heat to reduce the viscosity of fluid such as oil or hydrocarbons in and near wellbore . In certain embodiments heater raises the temperature of the fluid in wellbore up to a temperature of 250 C. or less for example 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. . Heater may be at higher temperatures for example 275 C. 300 C. or 325 C. because the heater provides heat to conduit and there is some temperature differential between the heater and the conduit. Thus heat produced from the heater does not raise the temperature of fluids in the wellbore above 250 C.

In certain embodiments heater includes ferromagnetic materials such as Carpenter Temperature Compensator 32 Alloy 42 6 Alloy 52 Invar 36 or other iron nickel or iron nickel chromium alloys. In certain embodiments nickel or nickel chromium alloys are used in heater . In some embodiments heater includes a composite conductor with a more highly conductive material such as copper on the inside of the heater to improve the turndown ratio of the heater. Heat from heater heats fluids in or near wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the fluids and increase a production rate through conduit .

In certain embodiments portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore such as the vertical portion of the wellbore depicted in have a lower maximum temperature than portions of the heater located below the liquid level. For example portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore may have a maximum temperature of 100 C. while portions of the heater located below the liquid level have a maximum temperature of 250 C. In certain embodiments such a heater includes two or more ferromagnetic sections with different Curie temperatures to achieve the desired heating pattern. Providing less heat to portions of wellbore above the liquid level and closer to the surface may save energy.

In certain embodiments heater is electrically isolated on the heater s outside surface and allowed to move freely in conduit . In some embodiments electrically insulating centralizers are placed on the outside of heater to maintain a gap between conduit and the heater.

In some embodiments heater is cycled turned on and off so that fluids produced through conduit are not overheated. In an embodiment heater is turned on for a specified amount of time until a temperature of fluids in or near wellbore reaches a desired temperature for example the maximum temperature of the heater . During the heating time for example 10 days 20 days or 30 days production through conduit may be stopped to allow fluids in the formation to soak and obtain a reduced viscosity. After heating is turned off or reduced production through conduit is started and fluids from the formation are produced without excess heat being provided to the fluids. During production fluids in or near wellbore will cool down without heat from heater being provided. When the fluids reach a temperature at which production significantly slows down production is stopped and heater is turned back on to reheat the fluids. This process may be repeated until a desired amount of production is reached. In some embodiments some heat at a lower temperature is provided to maintain a flow of the produced fluids. For example low temperature heat for example 100 C. 125 C. or 150 C. may be provided in the upper portions of wellbore to keep fluids from cooling to a lower temperature.

Opening is located at or near a junction of heater and conduit . In some embodiments opening is a slot or a slit in conduit . In some embodiments opening includes more than one opening in conduit . Opening allows production fluids to flow into conduit from a wellbore. Perforated casing allows fluids to flow into the heating production assembly . In certain embodiments perforated casing is a wire wrapped screen. In one embodiment perforated casing is a 9 cm diameter wire wrapped screen.

Perforated casing may be coupled to casing with packing material . Packing material inhibits fluids from flowing into casing from outside perforated casing . Packing material may also be placed inside casing to inhibit fluids from flowing up the annulus between the casing and conduit . Seal assembly is used to seal conduit to packing material . Seal assembly may fix a position of conduit along a length of a wellbore. In some embodiments seal assembly allows for unsealing of conduit so that the production conduit and heater may be removed from the wellbore.

Feedthrough is used to pass lead in cable to supply power to heater . Lead in cable may be secured to conduit with clamp . In some embodiments lead in cable passes through packing material using a separate feedthrough.

A lifting gas for example natural gas methane carbon dioxide propane and or nitrogen may be provided to the annulus between conduit and casing . Valves are located along a length of conduit to allow gas to enter the production conduit and provide for gas lifting of fluids in the production conduit. The lifting gas may mix with fluids in conduit to lower the density of the fluids and allow for gas lifting of the fluids out of the formation. In certain embodiments valves are located in or near the overburden section of the formation so that gas lifting is provided in the overburden section. In some embodiments fluids are produced through the annulus between conduit and casing and the lifting gas is supplied through valves .

In an embodiment fluids are produced using a pump coupled to conduit . The pump may be a submersible pump for example an electric or gas powered submersible pump . In some embodiments a heater is coupled to conduit to maintain the reduced viscosity of fluids in the conduit and or the pump.

In certain embodiments an additional conduit such as an additional coiled tubing conduit is placed in the formation. Sensors may be placed in the additional conduit. For example a production logging tool may be placed in the additional conduit to identify locations of producing zones and or to assess flow rates. In some embodiments a temperature sensor for example a distributed temperature sensor a fiber optic sensor and or an array of thermocouples is placed in the additional conduit to determine a subsurface temperature profile.

Some embodiments of the heating production assembly are used in a well that preexists for example the heating production assembly is retrofitted for a preexisting production well heater well or monitoring well . An example of the heating production assembly that may be used in the preexisting well is depicted in . Some preexisting wells include a pump. The pump in the preexisting well may be left in the heating production well retrofitted with the heating production assembly.

In some embodiments heat is inhibited from transferring into conduit . depicts an embodiment of conduit and heaters that inhibit heat transfer into the conduit. Heaters are coupled to conduit . Heaters include ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections . Ferromagnetic sections provide heat at a temperature that reduces the viscosity of fluids in or near a wellbore. Non ferromagnetic sections provide little or no heat. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections are 6 m in length. In some embodiments ferromagnetic sections and non ferromagnetic sections are between 3 m and 12 m in length between 4 m and 11 m in length or between 5 m and 10 m in length. In certain embodiments non ferromagnetic sections include perforations to allow fluids to flow to conduit . In some embodiments heater is positioned so that perforations are not needed to allow fluids to flow to conduit .

Conduit may have perforations to allow fluid to enter the conduit. Perforations coincide with non ferromagnetic sections of heater . Sections of conduit that coincide with ferromagnetic sections include insulation conduit . Conduit may be a vacuum insulated tubular. For example conduit may be a vacuum insulated production tubular available from Oil Tech Services Inc. Houston Tex. U.S.A. . Conduit inhibits heat transfer into conduit from ferromagnetic sections . Limiting the heat transfer into conduit reduces heat loss and or inhibits overheating of fluids in the conduit. In an embodiment heater provides heat along an entire length of the heater and conduit includes conduit along an entire length of the production conduit.

In certain embodiments more than one wellbore is used to produce heavy oils from a formation using the temperature limited heater. depicts an end view of an embodiment with wellbores located in hydrocarbon layer . Portions of wellbores are placed substantially horizontally in a triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments wellbores have a spacing of 30 m to 60 m 35 m to 55 m or 40 m to 50 m. Wellbores may include production conduits and heaters previously described. Fluids may be heated and produced through wellbores at an increased production rate above a cold production rate for the formation. Production may continue for a selected time for example 5 years to 10 years 6 years to 9 years or 7 years to 8 years until heat produced from each of wellbores begins to overlap superposition of heat begins . At such a time heat from lower wellbores such as wellbores near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer is continued reduced or turned off while production is continued. Production in upper wellbores such as wellbores near the top of hydrocarbon layer may be stopped so that fluids in the hydrocarbon layer drain towards the lower wellbores. In some embodiments power is increased to the upper wellbores and the temperature raised above the Curie temperature to increase the heat injection rate. Draining fluids in the formation in such a process increases total hydrocarbon recovery from the formation.

In an embodiment a temperature limited heater is used in a horizontal heater production well. The temperature limited heater may provide selected amounts of heat to the toe and the heel of the horizontal portion of the well. More heat may be provided to the formation through the toe than through the heel creating a hot portion at the toe and a warm portion at the heel. Formation fluids may be formed in the hot portion and produced through the warm portion as shown in .

In an embodiment heat source includes warm portion . Warm portion is a portion of heat source that operates at lower heat outputs than hot portion . For example warm portion may output between 30 W m and 1000 W m 30 W m and 750 W m or 100 W m and 750 W m. Warm portion may be located closer to the heel of heat source . In certain embodiments warm portion is a transition portion for example a transition conductor between hot portion and overburden portion . Overburden portion is located in overburden . Overburden portion provides a lower heat output than warm portion . For example overburden portion may output between 10 W m and 90 W m 15 W m and 80 W m or 25 W m and 75 W m. In some embodiments overburden portion provides as close to no heat 0 W m as possible to overburden . Some heat however may be used to maintain fluids produced through opening in a vapor phase or at elevated temperature in overburden .

In certain embodiments hot portion of heat source heats hydrocarbons to high enough temperatures to result in coke forming in hydrocarbon layer . Coke may occur in an area surrounding opening . Warm portion may be operated at lower heat outputs so that coke does not form at or near the warm portion of heat source . Coke may extend radially from opening as heat from heat source transfers outward from the opening. At a certain distance however coke no longer forms because temperatures in hydrocarbon layer at the certain distance will not reach coking temperatures. The distance at which no coke forms is a function of heat output W m from heat source type of formation hydrocarbon content in the formation and or other conditions in the formation.

The formation of coke inhibits fluid flow into opening through the coking. Fluids in the formation may however be produced through opening at the heel of heat source for example at warm portion of the heat source where there is little or no coke formation. The lower temperatures at the heel of heat source reduce the possibility of increased cracking of formation fluids produced through the heel. Fluids may flow in a horizontal direction through the formation more easily than in a vertical direction. Typically horizontal permeability in a relatively permeable formation is approximately 5 to 10 times greater than vertical permeability. Thus fluids flow along the length of heat source in a substantially horizontal direction. Producing formation fluids through opening is possible at earlier times than producing fluids through production wells in hydrocarbon layer . The earlier production times through opening is possible because temperatures near the opening increase faster than temperatures further away due to conduction of heat from heat source through hydrocarbon layer . Early production of formation fluids may be used to maintain lower pressures in hydrocarbon layer during start up heating of the formation. Start up heating of the formation is the time of heating before production begins at production wells in the formation. Lower pressures in the formation may increase liquid production from the formation. In addition producing formation fluids through opening may reduce the number of production wells needed in the formation.

In some embodiments a temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore heats steam that is provided to the wellbore. The heated steam may be introduced into a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments the heated steam may be used as a heat transfer fluid to heat a portion of the formation. In some embodiments the steam is used to solution mine desired minerals from the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater positioned in the wellbore heats liquid water that is introduced into a portion of the formation.

In an embodiment the temperature limited heater includes ferromagnetic material with a selected Curie temperature. The use of a temperature limited heater may inhibit a temperature of the heater from increasing beyond a maximum selected temperature for example at or about the Curie temperature . Limiting the temperature of the heater may inhibit potential burnout of the heater. The maximum selected temperature may be a temperature selected to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions superheated conditions or supercritical conditions. Using a temperature limited heater to heat the steam may inhibit overheating of the steam in the wellbore. Steam introduced into a formation may be used for synthesis gas production to heat the hydrocarbon containing formation to carry chemicals into the formation to extract chemicals or minerals from the formation and or to control heating of the formation.

A portion of the formation where steam is introduced or that is heated with steam may be at significant depths below the surface for example greater than about 1000 m about 2500 or about 5000 m below the surface . If steam is heated at the surface of the formation and introduced to the formation through a wellbore a quality of the heated steam provided to the wellbore at the surface may have to be relatively high to accommodate heat losses to the wellbore casing and or the overburden as the steam travels down the wellbore. Heating the steam in the wellbore may allow the quality of the steam to be significantly improved before the steam is provided to the formation. A temperature limited heater positioned in a lower section of the overburden and or adjacent to a target zone of the formation may be used to controllably heat steam to improve the quality of the steam injected into the formation and or inhibit condensation along the length of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater improves the quality of the steam injected and or inhibits condensation in the wellbore for long steam injection wellbores especially for long horizontal steam injection wellbores .

A temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore may be used to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions or superheated conditions. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater may heat the steam so that the steam is above or near supercritical conditions. The static head of fluid above the temperature limited heater may facilitate producing 100 saturation superheated and or supercritical conditions in the steam. Supercritical or near supercritical steam may be used to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation. In certain embodiments steam introduced into the formation may have a high density for example a specific gravity of about 0.8 or above . Increasing the density of the steam may improve the ability of the steam to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation.

Improved iron chromium and nickel alloys containing manganese copper and tungsten in combination with niobium carbon and nitrogen may maintain a finer grain size despite high temperature solution annealing or processing. Such behavior may be beneficial in reducing a heat affected zone in welded material. Higher solution annealing temperatures are particularly important for achieving the best metal carbide MC nanocarbide. For example niobium carbide NbC nanocarbide strengthening during high temperature creep service and such effects are amplified finer nanocarbide structures that are stable by compositions of the improved alloys. Tubing and canister applications that include the composition of the improved alloys and are wrought processed result in stainless steels that may be able to age harden during service at about 700 C. to about 800 C. Improved alloys may be able to age harden even more if the alloys are cold strained prior to high temperature service but such cold prestraining is not necessary for good high temperature properties or age hardening. Some prior art alloys such as NF709 require cold prestraining to achieve good high temperature creep properties and this is a disadvantage in particular because after such alloys are welded the advantages of the cold prestraining in the weld heat effected zone are lost. Cold prestraining may degrade rather than enhance high temperature strength and long term durability and therefore may be limited or not permitted by for example construction codes. The improved alloys described herein are suitable for low temperature applications for example cryogenic applications. The improved alloys which have strength and sufficient ductility at temperatures of for example 50 C. to 200 C. also retain strength at higher temperatures than many alloys often used in cryogenic applications such as 201 LN and YUS130 thus for services such as liquefied natural gas where a failure may result in a fire the improved alloy would retain strength in the vicinity of the fire longer than other materials.

An improved alloy composition may include by weight about 18 to about 22 chromium about 12 to about 13 nickel above about 0 to about 4.5 copper and in some embodiments above 3.0 to about 4.5 copper about 1 to about 10 manganese about 0.3 to about 1 silicon about 0.5 to about 1 niobium about 0.3 to about 1 molybdenum about 0.08 to about 0.2 carbon about 0.2 to about 0.5 nitrogen above 0 to about 2 tungsten and with the balance being essentially iron for example about 47.8 to about 68.12 iron and optionally other components . Such an improved alloy may be useful when processed by hot deformation cold deformation and or welding into for example casings canisters or strength members for heaters. In some embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 20 chromium about 3 copper about 4 manganese about 0.3 molybdenum about 0.77 niobium about 13 nickel about 0.5 silicon about 1 tungsten about 0.09 carbon and about 0.26 nitrogen with the balance being essentially iron. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 19 chromium about 4.2 manganese about 0.3 molybdenum about 0.8 niobium about 12.5 nickel about 0.5 silicon about 0.09 carbon about 0.24 nitrogen by weight with the balance being iron. In some embodiments improved alloys may vary an amount of manganese amount of nickel and or a Mn Ni ratio to enhance resistance to high temperature sulfidation increase high temperature strength and or reduce cost.

Improved wrought alloy compositions may include the compositions described in the preceding paragraphs compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0056860 to Maziasz et al. which is incorporated by reference herein or similar compositions. The improved wrought alloy composition may include at least 3.25 by weight precipitates at 800 C. The improved wrought alloy composition may have been processed by aging or hot working and or by cold working. As a result of such aging or hot working and or cold working the improved wrought alloy compositions for example NbC Cr rich MC may contain nanocarbonitrides precipitates. Such nanocarbonitride precipitates are not known to be present in cast compositions such as those disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003 0056860 and are believed to formed upon hot working and or cold working of the compositions. The nanocarbonitride precipitates may include particles having dimensions from about 5 nanometers to about 100 nanometers from about 10 nanometers to about 90 nanometers or from about 20 to about 80 nanometers. These wrought alloys may have microstructures consisting of at least but not limited to nanocarbides NbC Cr rich MC which form during aging stress free or creep stress

The improved wrought alloy may include nanonitrides for example NbCrN in the matrix together with nanocarbides after for example being aged for 1000 hours at 800 C. The NbCr nitrides have been identified using analytical electron microscopy AEM as rich in Nb and Cr and as the tetragonal nitride phase by electron diffraction both carbides are cubic phases . X ray energy dispersive quantitative analysis has shown that for the improved alloy compositions these nanoscale nitride particles may have a composition by weight of about 63 Nb 28 Cr and 6 Fe with other components being less than 1.5 each. Such NbCr nitrides were not observed in aged cast stainless steels with similar compositions and appear to be a direct consequence of the wrought processing. The mixed microstructures of nanocarbides and nanonitrides may be responsible for the improved strength of these alloy compositions at elevated temperatures such as for example 900 1000 C.

In some embodiments the improved alloys are processed to produce a wrought material. A 6 inside diameter centrifugal cast pipe having a wall thickness of 1.5 may be cast from the improved alloy. A section may be removed from the casting and heat treated at a temperature of least 1250 C. for for example about three hours. The heat treated section may be hot rolled at a temperature of least 1200 C. to a 0.75 thickness annealed at a temperature of least 1200 C. for fifteen minutes and then sandblasted. The sandblasted section may be cold rolled to a thickness of about 0.55 . The cold rolled section may be annealed at a temperature of least 1250 C. for about an hour in for example air with an argon cover and then given a final additional heat treatment for about one hour at a temperature of least 1250 C. in air with an argon blanket. An alternative process may include any of the following initially homogenizing the cast plate at a temperature of at least 1200 C. for about 1 hours hot rolling at least 1200 C. to a 1 thickness and annealing the cold rolled plate for about one hour at a temperature of least 1200 C. The improved alloys may be extruded at for example about 1200 C. with for example a mandrel diameter of 0.9 and a die diameter of 1.35 to produce good quality tubes. The wrought material may be welded by for example laser welding or tungsten gas arc welding. Thus tubes may be produced by rolling plates and welding seams.

Annealing the improved alloys at higher temperatures such as 1250 C. may improve properties of the alloys. At a higher temperature more of the phases go into solution and upon cooling precipitate into phases that contribute positively to the properties such as high temperature creep and tensile strength. Annealing at temperatures higher than 1250 C. such as 1300 C. may be beneficial. For example calculated phase present in the improved alloys may decrease by 0.08 at 1300 C. as opposed to the phase present in the improved alloys at 1200 C. Thus upon cooling more useful precipitates may form by 0.08 . Improved alloys may have high temperature creep strengths and tensile strengths that are superior to conventional alloys. For example niobium stabilized stainless steel alloys that include manganese nitrogen copper and tungsten may have high temperature creep strengths and tensile strengths that are improved or substantially improved relative to conventional alloys such as 347H.

Improved alloys may have increased strength relative to standard stainless steel alloys such as Super 304H at high temperatures for example about 700 C. about 800 C. or above 1000 C. . Superior high temperature creep rupture strength for example creep rupture strength at about 800 C. about 900 C. or about 1250 C. may be improved as a result of a composition b stable fine grain microstructures induced by high temperature processing and c age induced precipitation structures in the improved alloys. Precipitation structures include for example micro carbides that strengthen grain boundaries and stable nanocarbides that strengthen inside the grains. Presence of phases other than sigma laves G and chi phases contribute to high temperature properties. Stable microstructures may be achieved by proper selection of components. High temperature aging induced or creep induced microstructures may have minimal or no intermetallic sigma laves and chi phases. Intermetallic sigma lava and chi phases may weaken the strength properties of alloys.

At about 800 C. the improved alloys may include at least 3 or at least 3.25 by weight of microcarbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. At about 900 C. the improved alloys may include by weight at least 1.5 at least 2 at least 3 at least 3.5 or at least 5 microcarbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. These values may be higher than the corresponding values in 347H or Super 304H stainless steel alloys at about 900 C. At about 1250 C. improved alloys may include at least 0.5 by weight micro carbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure that produce strength. The resulting higher weight percent of microcarbides other phases and or stable fine grain microstructure and the exclusion of sigma and laves phases may account for superior high temperature performance of the improved alloys.

Alloys having similar or superior high temperature performance to the improved alloys may be derived by modeling phase behavior at elevated temperatures and selecting compositions that retain at least 1.5 at least 2 or at least 2.5 by weight of phases other than sigma or laves phases at for example about 900 C. For example a stable microstructure may include an amount by weight of niobium that is nearly ten times the amount of carbon from about 1 to about 12 manganese and from about 0.15 to about 0.5 of nitrogen. Copper and tungsten may be included in the composition to increase the amount of stable microstructures. The choice of elements for the improved alloys allows processing by various methods and results in a stable fine grain size even after heat treatments of at least 1250 C. Many prior art alloys tend to grain coarsen significantly when annealed at such high temperatures whereas the improved alloy can be improved by such high temperature treatment. In some embodiments grain size is controlled to achieve desirable high temperature tensile and creep properties. Stable grain structure in the improved alloys reduces grain boundary sliding and may be a contributing factor for the better strength relative to commercially available alloys at temperatures above for example about 650 C.

A downhole heater assembly may include 5 10 20 40 or more heaters coupled together. For example a heater assembly may include between 10 and 40 heaters. Heaters in a downhole heater assembly may be coupled in series. In some embodiments heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced from about 7.6 m to about 30.5 m apart. For example heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced about 15 m apart. Spacing between heaters in a heater assembly may be a function of heat transfer from the heaters to the formation. For example a spacing between heaters may be chosen to limit temperature variation along a length of a heater assembly to acceptable limits. A heater assembly may advantageously provide substantially uniform heating over a relatively long length of an opening in a formation. Heaters in a heater assembly may include but are not limited to electrical heaters for example insulated conductor heaters conductor in conduit heaters pipe in pipe heaters flameless distributed combustors natural distributed combustors and or oxidizers. In some embodiments heaters in a downhole heater assembly may include only oxidizers.

Fuel may be supplied to oxidizers through fuel conduit . In some embodiments the fuel for the oxidizers may be hydrogen or a high hydrogen content hydrocarbon mixture. Using hydrogen as the fuel has several advantages over hydrocarbon fuels. For example hydrogen is easy to ignite oxidizing hydrogen does not result in the generation of carbon dioxide or other undesired reaction products and coking of the fuel line is eliminated.

In some embodiments the fuel may be methane or natural gas. In some embodiments the fuel may be a mixture of hydrocarbons produced from an in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments fuel used to initiate combustion may be enriched to decrease the temperature required for ignition. In some embodiments hydrogen H or other hydrogen rich fluids may be used to enrich fuel initially supplied to the oxidizers. After ignition of the oxidizers enrichment of the fuel may be stopped. In some embodiments a portion or portions of fuel conduit may include a catalytic surface for example a catalytic outer surface to decrease an ignition temperature of fuel .

Portions of the fuel conduit subjected to high temperatures may include heat shielding. The heat shielding may include an insulative underlayer and a thermally conductive overlayer. The overlayer may be a ceramic layer. The underlayer may be a low thermal conductivity ceramic sleeve or coating. The overlayer may be a high thermal conductivity coating. In some embodiments the fuel line may be positioned in a conduit. A cooling flow may be circulated through the space between the fuel line and the conduit.

Oxidizing fluid may be supplied to oxidizer assembly through oxidizer conduit . In some embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidizers may be positioned concentrically or substantially concentrically in oxidizer conduit . In some embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidizers may be arranged other than concentrically with respect to oxidizer conduit . In certain branched opening embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidizer conduit may have a weld or coupling to allow placement of oxidizer assemblies in branches of the opening.

An ignition source may be positioned in or proximate oxidizers to initiate combustion. In some embodiments an ignition source may heat the fuel and or the oxidizing fluid supplied to a particular heater to a temperature sufficient to support ignition of the fuel. The fuel may be oxidized with the oxidizing fluid in oxidizers to generate heat. Oxidation products may mix with oxidizing fluid downstream of the first oxidizer in oxidizer conduit . Exhaust gas may include unreacted oxidizing fluid and unreacted fuel as well as oxidation products. In some embodiments a portion of exhaust gas from a first oxidizer may be provided to oxidizers downstream of the first oxidizer. In some embodiments a portion of exhaust gas may return to the surface through outer conduit . As the exhaust gas returns to the surface through outer conduit heat from exhaust gas may be transferred to the formation. Returning exhaust gas through outer conduit may provide substantially uniform heating along oxidizer assembly due to heat from the exhaust gas integrating with the heat provided from individual oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly. In some embodiments oxidizing fluid may be introduced through outer conduit and exhaust gas may be returned through oxidizer conduit . In certain embodiments heat integration may occur along an extended vertical portion of an opening.

In some embodiments the oxidizer assembly may be a heat source used to heat water or steam. Steam produced by heat from the oxidizer assembly may be introduced into the formation. The oxidizer assembly may be placed in a conduit. The conduit may include critical flow orifices. The oxidizer assembly may be started. Heat produced by the oxidizer assembly may be used to heat water introduced into the space between the oxidizer assembly and the conduit. Steam produced from the heat may pass through the critical flow orifices in the conduit into the formation.

Oxidizing fluid supplied to an oxidizer assembly may include but is not limited to air oxygen enriched air and or hydrogen peroxide. Depletion of oxygen in oxidizing fluid may occur toward a terminal end of an oxidizer assembly. In an embodiment a flow of oxidizing fluid may be increased for example by using compression to provide excess oxidizing fluid such that sufficient oxygen is present for operation of the terminal oxidizer. In some embodiments oxidizing fluid may be enriched by increasing an oxygen content of the oxidizing fluid prior to introduction of the oxidizing fluid to the oxidizers. Oxidizing fluid may be enriched by methods including but not limited to adding oxygen to the oxidizing fluid adding an additional oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide to the oxidizing fluid for example air and or flowing oxidizing fluid through a membrane that allows preferential diffusion of oxygen.

For oxidizers that use hydrocarbon fuel steps may be taken to reduce coking of fuel in the fuel conduit after ignition of the oxidizers. For example steam may be added to the fuel to inhibit coking in the fuel conduit. In some embodiments the fuel may be methane that is mixed with steam in a molar ratio of up to 1 1. In some embodiments coking may be inhibited by decreasing a residence time of fuel in the fuel conduit. In some embodiments coking may be inhibited by insulating portions of the fuel conduit that pass through high temperature zones proximate oxidizers.

If steam is to be added to the fuel the steam needs to be added at the right point. If steam is added to the fuel at the surface the steam may condense in the fuel line on the way down to the first oxidizer. The resulting water may slug into the first oxidizer and flameout the oxidizer. In some embodiments a separate water line is used to introduce water into the fuel line. In an embodiment the water line is tubing that transports softened water to the fuel line near the first oxidizer. When the oxidizers are first initialized coking prevention may not be needed so water is not sent through the water line. When the first oxidizer is hot water may be sent through the water line to the fuel line. The water may be introduced into the fuel conduit at a location where the temperature is about 65 C. The entrance nozzle the heat from the first oxidizer and the velocity of the fuel in the fuel line may atomize or vaporize the water supplied to the fuel conduit.

During operation there is enough flow through the oxidizer system to protect the fuel line from overheating and to minimize the flame temperature. The openings of the oxidizers are designed to allow a certain flowrate through the system that increases as the bypass flow increases. At lower bypass flows the amount of gas is restricted and temperatures may become elevated. At the design bypass flow the maximum temperatures are lower which may result in no or low amounts of oxides of nitrogen and a low fuel line temperature.

In some embodiments opening sizes in the oxidizers and the fuel line pressure relative to the oxidant line pressure may be controlled to create a flammable mixture in each oxidizer. The composition of the fuel may be controlled to minimize flame temperatures. The composition of the fuel may be changed by adding diluent such as but not limited to steam and or nitrogen. Opening sizes fuel line pressure and fuel composition allow the flame region of each oxidizer to remain hot stable and protected from the bypass flow around the oxidizers so that the oxidizers burn out the fuel supplied to the individual oxidizers.

In some embodiments the igniters for the oxidizers include temperature limited heater elements. When the oxidizer is operating the temperature of the oxidizer heats the igniter element above the Curie temperature of the igniter element so that skin effect heating goes away and electricity flows through all or substantially all of the heater element. If the igniter element temperature is below the Curie temperature of the igniter element the electricity flowing through the igniter element is confined to a certain depth so the effective resistance of the igniter element increases. The increase in effective resistance causes resistive heating that raises the temperature of the igniter element above the ignition temperature of the fuel and gas mixture for the oxidizer.

In some embodiments catalytic igniters may be used. The catalytic igniters may have long operation life at high temperatures. Catalytic igniters may enable hot restarts without having to shut down all flames in the remaining burners when one or more burners flame out. The amount of hydrogen can be varied in the fuel supply to the catalytic igniters so that fluid flow through the oxidizer system does not have to be lowered to hit ignition conditions for a particular oxidizer. Under certain operating conditions one or more of the catalytic igniters could be supplied with fuel so that the igniter is hot to assist combustion in case an oxidizer becomes weak or troublesome due to manufacturing or long term degradation of the oxidizer. Use of catalytic igniters may allow for relatively simple startups.

In some embodiments flame stabilizers may be added to the oxidizers. The flame stabilizers may attach the flame to the heat shield. The high bypass flow around the oxidizer cools the heat shield and protects the internals of the oxidizer from damage. depict various embodiments of heat shields with flame stabilizers . Flame stabilizer depicted in is a ring. Flame stabilizer depicted in is an angled ring. The rings may amount to up to about 25 annular area blockage. The rings may establish a recirculation zone near heat shield and away from the fuel line passing through the center of the heat shield.

One of more of the oxidizers in an oxidizer assembly may be a catalytic burner. The catalytic burners may include a catalytic portion followed by a homogenous portion. Catalytic burners may be started late in an ignition sequence and may ignite without igniters. Oxidant for the catalytic burners would be sufficiently hot from upstream burners for example the oxidant may be at a temperature of about 370 C. if the fuel is primarily methane so that a primary mixture would react over the catalyst in the catalyst portion and produce enough heat so that exiting products ignite a secondary mixture in the homogenous portion of the oxidizer. In some embodiments the fuel may include enough hydrogen to allow the needed temperature of the oxidant to be lower. The catalytic portion of the catalytic burner may use significantly less fuel than the homogenous portion so that a significant portion of the heat of the catalytic burner is produced in the homogenous portion of the burner.

In some embodiments a catalytic burner may include an igniter to simplify startup procedures. depicts catalytic burner that includes igniter . Igniter is positioned in mix chamber . Oxidant enters mix chamber through openings A. Fuel enters the mix chamber from fuel line through fuel openings A. The fuel input into mixture chamber may be only a small fraction of the fuel input for catalytic burner . Inputs into mixture chamber may be critical flow orifices to maintain tight control of the mixture under a wide range of operating conditions. Igniter raises the temperature of the fuel and oxidant to combustion temperatures in pre heat zone . Flame stabilizer may be positioned in mixing chamber . Heat from pre heat zone and or combustion products may heat additional fuel that enters mixing chamber through fuel openings B and additional oxidant that enters the mixing chamber through openings B. Openings B and openings B may be upstream of flame stabilizer . The additional fuel and oxidant are heated to a temperature sufficient to support reaction on catalyst .

Heated fuel and oxidant from mixing chamber pass to catalyst . The fuel and oxidant react on catalyst to form hot reaction products. The hot reaction products may be directed to heat shield . Additional fuel enters heat shield through openings C in fuel conduit . Additional oxidant enters heat shield through openings . The hot reaction products generated by catalyst may ignite fuel and oxidant in autoignition zone . Autoignition zone may allow fuel and oxidant to form main combustion zone .

In some embodiments all of the oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly are catalytic burners. In some embodiments the first or the first several oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly are catalytic burners. The oxidant supplied to these burners may be at a lower temperature than subsequent burners. Using catalytic burners with igniters may stabilize the performance of the first several oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly. Catalytic burners may be used in line with other burners to reduce emissions by allowing lower flame temperatures while still having substantially complete combustion.

In some embodiments a catalytic converter may be positioned at the end of the oxidizer assembly or in the exhaust gas return. The catalytic converter may remove unburned hydrocarbons and or remaining oxides of nitrogen or other pollutants. The catalytic converter may benefit from the relatively high temperature of the exhaust gas. In some embodiments catalytic burners in series may be integrated with coupled catalytic converters to limit undesired emissions from the oxidizer assembly. In some embodiments a selectively permeable material may be used to allow carbon dioxide or other fluids to be separated from the exhaust gas. The carbon dioxide may be sequestered in a spent portion of the formation to sequester the carbon dioxide.

In some embodiments a flameless distributed combustor may be the front and or back burner. Having a flameless distributed combustor as the front burner may stabilize the front burner and provide heated oxidant to the next oxidizer. Having a flameless distributed combustor as the back burner may ensure that the exhaust is depleted in case one or more of the oxidizers flame out.

In some embodiments the igniters may be removable or retractable from the flame after ignition. The igniter may be placed in a sheath or pulled back from the flame. Having the ability to remove or retract the igniters may extend the life of the igniters and provide for a more reliable system should one or more of the oxidizers need to be restarted.

The spacing of the oxidizers in an oxidizer assembly may be varied. The spacing may be varied to accommodate rich and lean portions of the formation. In some embodiments the heat duty of selected oxidizers may be increased by using ceramic parts inside the oxidizers. Increasing the heat duty may simplify the overall design and or permit a system with fewer burners.

In some embodiments the fuel line may be located adjacent to the oxidizers. A separate line would need to be routed from the fuel line to each oxidizer. Air shields would be needed to shield and stabilize the flame due to the high gas flow requirements. Also shielding may be needed to protect oxidizer components.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments a downhole gas turbine is used to provide a portion of the electricity for an electric heater. The exhaust from the gas turbine may heat the formation. The heater may be a temperature limited heater in a horizontal section of a U shaped well. In some embodiments the substantially horizontal section of the U shaped well is over 1000 m long over 1300 m long over 1600 m long or over 1900 m long.

Electricity provided by electrical generator is directed to temperature limited heater through lead in conductors . Lead in conductors may be insulated conductors. If electrical generator is not able to supply enough electricity to temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbon layer to a desired temperature additional electricity may be supplied to the temperature limited heater through a conductor placed in inlet leg and electrically coupled to the temperature limited heater.

Exhaust gas from gas turbine passes through tubular to outlet . In an embodiment the tubular is 4 stainless steel pipe placed in a 6 wellbore. The exhaust gases heat an initial section of hydrocarbon layer before the gases become too cool to heat the hydrocarbon layer to the desired temperature. Temperature limited heater begins a selected distance from gas turbine . The distance may be 200 m 150 m 100 m or less. Heat provided to the portion of the formation from gas turbine to temperature limited heater may come from the exhaust gases passing through tubular . Temperature limited heater which is at least partially supplied with electricity generated by gas turbine heats hydrocarbon layer and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine. Temperature limited heater may be an insulated conductor heater with a self limiting temperature of about 760 C. In some embodiments temperature limited heater is placed in tubular . In other embodiments the temperature limited heater is on the outside of the tubular. Temperature limited heater may end at a selected horizontal distance from the outlet of the temperature limited heater. The distance may be 200 m 150 m 100 m or less. The exhaust gases heated by temperature limited heater transfer heat to hydrocarbon layer before passing through overburden to outlet .

Inlets and outlets of the U shaped wells for heating a portion of the formation may be placed in alternating directions in adjacent wells. Alternating inlets and outlets of the U shaped wells may allow for uniform heating of the hydrocarbon layer of the formation.

In some embodiments a portion of oxidant for gas turbine is routed to the gas turbine from outlet of an adjacent U shaped well. The portion of oxidant may be sent to the gas turbine through a separate line. Using oxidant from the exit of the adjacent well may allow some of the oxidant and or heat from the exiting exhaust gases to be recovered and utilized. The separate exhaust gas line to the gas turbine may transfer heat to the main oxidant line and or fuel line to the gas turbine.

Compressors and partial expanders may be located at the surface. Compressed fuel lines and oxidant lines extend to gas turbine . Generators burners and expanders of the gas turbine may be located at or near the transition between the overburden and the hydrocarbon layer that is to be heated. Locating equipment in this manner may reduce the complexity of the downhole equipment and reduce pressure drops for the oxidant going down the wellbore and the combustion gases going through the heater sections and back to the surface. The surface expander for a first well can expand gases from an adjacent well outlet since the adjacent well outlet is physically closer to the inlet of the first well than is the outlet of the first well. Moving compressed fuel and compressed oxidant down to the gas turbine may result in less pressure drop as compared to having cool fuel and oxidant travel down to the gas turbine. Placing gas turbine at or near the transition between overburden and hydrocarbon layer allows exhaust gas from the gas turbine to heat portions of the formation that are to be pyrolyzed. Placing the gas turbine at or near the transition between overburden and hydrocarbon layer may eliminate or reduce the amount of insulation needed between the overburden and inlet leg . In some embodiments tapered insulation may be applied at the exit of gas turbine to reduce excess heating of the formation near the gas turbine.

In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments a circulation system is used to heat the formation. The circulation system may be a closed loop circulation system. depicts a schematic representation of a system for heating a formation using a circulation system. The system may be used to heat hydrocarbons that are relatively deep in the ground and that are in formations that are relatively large in extent. In some embodiments the hydrocarbons may be 100 m 200 m 300 m or more below the surface. The circulation system may also be used to heat hydrocarbons that are not as deep in the ground. The hydrocarbons may be in formations that extend lengthwise up to 500 m 750 m 1000 m or more. The circulation system may become economically viable in formations where the length of the hydrocarbon containing formation to be treated is long compared to the thickness of the overburden. The ratio of the hydrocarbon formation extent to be heated by heaters to the overburden thickness may be at least 3 at least 5 or at least 10. The heaters of the circulation system may be positioned relative to adjacent heaters so that superposition of heat between heaters of the circulation system allows the temperature of the formation to be raised at least above the boiling point of aqueous formation fluid in the formation.

In some embodiments heaters may be formed in the formation by drilling a first wellbore and then drilling a second wellbore that connects with the first wellbore. Piping may be positioned in the U shaped wellbore to form U shaped heater . Heaters are connected to heat transfer fluid circulation system by piping. Gas at high pressure may be used as the heat transfer fluid in the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is chemically stable at the required temperatures and pressures and has a relatively high molecular weight that results in a high volumetric heat capacity. Other fluids such as steam air helium and or nitrogen may also be used. The pressure of the heat transfer fluid entering the formation may be 3000 kPa or higher. The use of high pressure heat transfer fluid allows the heat transfer fluid to have a greater density and therefore a greater capacity to transfer heat. Also the pressure drop across the heaters is less for a system where the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a first pressure for a given mass flow rate than when the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a second pressure at the same mass flow rate when the first pressure is greater than the second pressure. In some embodiments a liquid heat transfer fluid may be used. The liquid heat transfer fluid may be a natural or synthetic oil or other type of high temperature heat transfer fluid.

Heat transfer fluid circulation system may include heat supply first heat exchanger second heat exchanger and compressor . Heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a high temperature. Heat supply may be a furnace solar collector chemical reactor nuclear reactor fuel cell exhaust heat or other high temperature source able to supply heat to the heat transfer fluid. In the embodiment depicted in heat supply is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature in a range from about 700 C. to about 920 C. from about 770 C. to about 870 C. or from about 800 C. to about 850 C. In an embodiment heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 820 C. The heat transfer fluid flows from heat supply to heaters . Heat transfers from heaters to formation adjacent to the heaters. The temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation may be in a range from about 350 C. to about 580 C. from about 400 C. to about 530 C. or from about 450 C. to about 500 C. In an embodiment the temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation is about 480 C. The metallurgy of the piping used to form heat transfer fluid circulation system may be varied to significantly reduce costs of the piping. High temperature steel may be used from heat supply to a point where the temperature is sufficiently low so that less expensive steel can be used from that point to first heat exchanger . Several different steel grades may be used to form the piping of heat transfer fluid circulation system .

Heat transfer fluid from heat supply of heat transfer fluid circulation system passes through overburden of formation to hydrocarbon layer . Portions of heaters extending through overburden may be insulated. In some embodiments the insulation or part of the insulation is a polyimide insulating material. Inlet portions of heaters in hydrocarbon layer may have tapering insulation to reduce overheating of the hydrocarbon layer near the inlet of the heater into the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments the diameter of the pipe in overburden may be smaller than the diameter of pipe through hydrocarbon layer . The smaller diameter pipe through overburden may allow for less heat transfer to the overburden. Reducing the amount of heat transfer to overburden reduces the amount of cooling of the heat transfer fluid supplied to pipe adjacent to hydrocarbon layer . The increased heat transfer in the smaller diameter pipe due to increased velocity of heat transfer fluid through the small diameter pipe is offset by the smaller surface area of the smaller diameter pipe and the decrease in residence time of the heat transfer fluid in the smaller diameter pipe.

After exiting formation the heat transfer fluid passes through first heat exchanger and second heat exchanger to compressor . First heat exchanger transfers heat between heat transfer fluid exiting formation and heat transfer fluid exiting compressor to raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid that enters heat supply and reduce the temperature of the fluid exiting formation . Second heat exchanger further reduces the temperature of the heat transfer fluid before the heat transfer fluid enters compressor .

In some embodiments piping for the circulation system may allow the direction of heat transfer fluid flow through the formation to be changed. Changing the direction of heat transfer fluid flow through the formation allows each end of a u shaped wellbore to initially receive the heat transfer fluid at the heat transfer fluid s hottest temperature for a period of time which may result in more uniform heating of the formation. The direction of heat transfer fluid may be changed at desired time intervals. The desired time interval may be about a year about six months about three months about two months or any other desired time interval.

In some embodiments nuclear energy may be used to heat the heat transfer fluid used in the circulation system to heat a portion of the formation. Heat supply in may be a pebble bed reactor or other type of nuclear reactor such as a light water reactor. The use of nuclear energy provides a heat source with no carbon dioxide emissions. Also the use of nuclear energy can be more efficient because energy losses resulting from the conversion of heat to electricity and electricity to heat are avoided by directly utilizing the heat produced from the nuclear reactions without producing electricity.

In some embodiments a nuclear reactor may heat helium. For example helium flows through a pebble bed reactor and heat transfers to the helium. The helium may be used as the heat transfer fluid to heat the formation. In some embodiments the nuclear reactor may heat helium and the helium may be passed through a heat exchanger to provide heat to the heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation. The pebble bed reactor may include a pressure vessel that contains encapsulated enriched uranium dioxide fuel. Helium may be used as a heat transfer fluid to remove heat from the pebble bed reactor. Heat may be transferred in a heat exchanger from the helium to the heat transfer fluid used in the circulation system. The heat transfer fluid used in the circulation system may be carbon dioxide a molten salt or other fluid. Pebble bed reactor systems are available from PBMR Ltd Centurion South Africa .

In some embodiments the system may include auxiliary power unit . In some embodiments auxiliary power unit generates power by passing the helium from heat exchanger units through a generator to make electricity. The helium may be sent to one or more compressors and or heat exchangers to adjust the pressure and temperature of the helium before the helium is sent to nuclear reactor . In some embodiments auxiliary power unit generates power using a heat transfer fluid for example ammonia or aqua ammonia . Helium from heat exchanger units is sent to additional heat exchanger units to transfer heat to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is taken through a power cycle such as a Kalina cycle to generate electricity. In an embodiment nuclear reactor is a 400 MW reactor and auxiliary power unit generates about 30 MW of electricity.

Circulation systems may be used to heat portions of the formation. Production wells in the formation are used to remove produced fluids. After production from the formation has ended the circulation system may be used to recover heat from the formation. depicts an embodiment of a circulation system. Heat transfer fluid may be circulated through heaters after heat supply is disconnected from the circulation system. The heat transfer fluid may be a different heat transfer fluid than the heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation. Heat transfers from the heated formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may be used to heat another portion of the formation or the heat transfer fluid may be used for other purposes. In some embodiments water is introduced into heaters to produce steam. In some embodiments low temperature steam is introduced into heaters so that the passage of the steam through the heaters increases the temperature of the steam. Other heat transfer fluids including natural or synthetic oils such as Syltherm oil Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. U.S.A. may be used instead of steam or water.

In some embodiments the circulation system may be used in conjunction with electrical heating. In some embodiments at least a portion of the pipe in the U shaped wellbores adjacent to portions of the formation that are to be heated is made of a ferromagnetic material. For example the piping adjacent to a layer or layers of the formation to be heated is made of a 9 to 13 chromium steel such as 410 stainless steel. The pipe may be a temperature limited heater when time varying electric current is applied to the piping. The time varying electric current may resistively heat the piping which heats the formation. In some embodiments direct electric current may be used to resistively heat the piping which heats the formation.

In some embodiments the circulation system is used to heat the formation to a first temperature and electrical energy is used to maintain the temperature of the formation and or heat the formation to higher temperatures. The first temperature may be sufficient to vaporize aqueous formation fluid in the formation. The first temperature may be at most about 200 C. at most about 300 C. at most about 350 C. or at most about 400 C. Using the circulation system to heat the formation to the first temperature allows the formation to be dry when electricity is used to heat the formation. Heating the dry formation may minimize electrical current leakage into the formation.

In some embodiments the circulation system and electrical heating may be used to heat the formation to a first temperature. The formation may be maintained or the temperature of the formation may be increased from the first temperature using the circulation system and or electrical heating. In some embodiments the formation may be raised to the first temperature using electrical heating and the temperature may be maintained and or increased using the circulation system. Economic factors available electricity availability of fuel for heating the heat transfer fluid and other factors may be used to determine when electrical heating and or circulation system heating are to be used.

In certain embodiments the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer is coupled to lead in conductors. Lead in conductors may be located in overburden . Lead in conductors may electrically couple the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer to one or more wellheads at the surface. Electrical isolators may be located at a junction of the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer with portions of heater in overburden so that the portions of the heater in the overburden are electrically isolated from the portion of the heater in the hydrocarbon layer. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are placed inside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are positioned outside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the lead in conductors are insulated conductors with mineral insulation such as magnesium oxide. The lead in conductors may include highly electrically conductive materials such as copper or aluminum to reduce heat losses in overburden during electrical heating.

In certain embodiments the portions of heater in overburden may be used as lead in conductors. The portions of heater in overburden may be electrically coupled to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments one or more electrically conducting materials such as copper or aluminum are coupled for example cladded or welded to the portions of heater in overburden to reduce the electrical resistance of the portions of the heater in the overburden. Reducing the electrical resistance of the portions of heater in overburden reduces heat losses in the overburden during electrical heating.

In some embodiments the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer is a temperature limited heater with a self limiting temperature between about 600 C. and about 1000 C. The portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be a 9 to 13 chromium stainless steel. For example portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be 410 stainless steel. Time varying current may be applied to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer so that the heater operates as a temperature limited heater.

Electrical power supply system may include transformer and cables . In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers.

In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. . Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and or reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer to the heaters. In some embodiments cables may be made of carbon nanotubes.

In some embodiments geothermal energy may be used to heat or preheat a treatment area of an in situ heat treatment process or a treatment area to be solution mined Geothermal energy may have little or no carbon dioxide emissions. In some embodiments hot fluid may be produced from a layer or layers located below or near the treatment area. The hot fluid may be steam water and or brine. One or more of the layers may be geothermally pressurized geysers. Hot fluid may be pumped from one or more of the layers. The layer or layers may be 2 km 4 km 8 km or more below the surface. The hot fluid may be at a temperature of over 100 C. over 200 C. or over 300 C.

The hot fluid may be produced and circulated through piping in the treatment area to raise the temperature of the treatment area. In some embodiments the hot fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area. In some embodiments the hot fluid is circulated through the treatment area or piping in the treatment area without being produced to the surface and re introduced into the treatment area. In some embodiments the hot fluid may be produced from a location near the treatment area. The hot fluid may be transported to the treatment area. Once transported to the treatment area the hot fluid is circulated through piping in the treatment area or the hot fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area.

In some embodiments hot fluid produced from a layer or layers is used to solution mine minerals from the formation. The hot fluid may be used to raise the temperature of the formation to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the minerals but to a temperature high enough to increase the amount of mineral going into solution in a first fluid introduced into the formation. The hot fluid may be introduced directly into the formation as all or a portion of the first fluid or the hot fluid may be circulated through piping in the formation.

In some embodiments hot fluid produced from a layer or layers may be used to heat the treatment area before using electrical energy or other types of heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. The hot fluid may not be at a temperature sufficient to raise the temperature of the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. Using the hot fluid to heat the treatment area before using electrical heaters or other heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures may reduce energy costs for the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments hot dry rock technology may be used to produce steam or other hot heat transfer fluid from a deep portion of the formation. Injection wells may be drilled to a depth where the formation is hot. The injection wells may be over 2 km over 4 km or over 8 km deep. Sections of the formation adjacent to the bottom portions of the injection wells may be hydraulically or otherwise fractured to provide large contact area with the formation and or to provide flow paths to heated fluid production wells. Water steam and or other heat transfer fluid may be introduced into the formation through the injection wells. Heat transfers to the introduced fluid from the formation. Steam and or hot heat transfer fluid may be produced from the heated fluid production wells. In some embodiments the steam and or hot heat transfer fluid is directed into the treatment area from the production wells without first producing the steam and or hot heat transfer fluid to the surface. The steam and or hot heat transfer fluid may be used to heat a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation above the deep hot portion of the formation.

In some embodiments steam produced from heated fluid production wells may be used as the steam for a drive process for example a steam flood process or steam assisted gravity drainage process . In some embodiments steam or other hot heat transfer fluid produced through heated fluid production wells is passed through U shaped wellbores or other types of wellbores to provide initial heating to the formation. In some embodiments cooled steam or water or cooled heat transfer fluid resulting from the use of the steam and or heat transfer fluid from the hot portion of the formation may be collected and sent to the hot portion of the formation to be reheated.

In certain embodiments a controlled or staged in situ heating and production process is used to in situ heat treat a hydrocarbon containing formation for example an oil shale formation . The staged in situ heating and production process may use less energy input to produce hydrocarbons from the formation than a continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the staged in situ heating and production process is about 30 more efficient in treating the formation than the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. The staged in situ heating and production process may also produce less carbon dioxide emissions than a continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments the staged in situ heating and production process is used to treat rich layers in the oil shale formation. Treating only the rich layers may be more economical than treating both rich layers and lean layers because heat may be wasted heating the lean layers.

In certain embodiments heaters in one of the sections are turned on while the heaters in other sections remain turned off. For example heaters in section may be turned on while the heaters in the other sections are left turned off. Heat from heaters in section may create permeability mobilize fluids and or pyrolysis fluids in section . While heat is being provided by heaters in section production well in section may be opened to produce fluids from the formation. Some heat from heaters in section may transfer to section and pre heat section . The pre heating of section may create permeability in section mobilize fluids in section and allow fluids to be produced from the section through production well . As fluids are produced from section the movement of fluids from section to section transfers heat between the sections. The movement of the hot fluids through the formation increases heat transfer within the formation. Allowing hot fluids to flow between the sections uses the energy of the hot fluids for heating of unheated sections rather than removing the heat from the formation by producing the hot fluids directly from section . Thus the movement of the hot fluids allows for less energy input to get production from the formation than is required if heat is provided from heaters in both sections to get production from the sections.

In some embodiments section and or section may be treated prior to turning on heaters to increase the permeability in the sections. For example the sections may be dewatered to increase the permeability in the sections. In some embodiments steam injection or other fluid injection may be used to increase the permeability in the sections.

In certain embodiments after a selected time heaters in section are turned on. Turning on heaters in section may provide additional heat to sections and to increase the permeability mobility and or pyrolysis of fluids in these sections. In some embodiments as heaters in section are turned on production in section is turned off shut down and production well in section is opened to produce fluids from the formation. Thus fluid flow in the formation towards production well in section and section is heated by the flow of hot fluids as described above for section . In some embodiments production well in section may be left open after the heaters are turned on in the section if desired. This process may be repeated for subsequent sections in the formation. For example after a selected time heaters in section may be turned on and fluids produced from production well in section and so on through the formation.

In some embodiments heat is provided by heaters in alternating sections for example sections and while fluids are produced from the sections in between the heated sections for example sections and . After a selected time heaters in the unheated sections sections and are turned on and fluids are produced from one or more of the sections as desired.

In certain embodiments a smaller heater spacing is used in the staged in situ heating and producing process than in the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment processes. For example the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process may use a heater spacing of about 12 m while the in situ staged heating and producing process uses a heater spacing of about 10 m. The staged in situ heating and producing process may use the smaller heater spacing because the staged process allows for relatively rapid heating of the formation and expansion of the formation.

In some embodiments the sequence of heated sections begins with the outermost sections and moves inwards. For example for a selected time heat may be provided by heaters in sections and as fluids are produced from sections and . After the selected time heaters in sections and may be turned on and fluids are produced from section . After another selected amount of time heaters in section may be turned on if needed.

In certain embodiments sections are substantially equal sized sections. The size and or location of sections may vary based on desired heating and or production from the formation. For example simulation of the staged in situ heating and production process treatment of the formation may be used to determine the number of heaters in each section the optimum pattern of sections and or the sequence for heater power up and production well startup for the staged in situ heating and production process. The simulation may account for properties such as but not limited to formation properties and desired properties and or quality in the produced fluids. In some embodiments heaters at the edges of the treated portions of the formation for example heaters at the left edge of section or the right edge of section may have tailored or adjusted heat outputs to produce desired heat treatment of the formation.

In some embodiments the formation is sectioned into a checkerboard pattern for the staged in situ heating and production process. depicts a top view of rectangular checkerboard pattern embodiment for the staged in situ heating and production process. In some embodiments heaters in the A sections sections A A A A and A may be turned on and fluids are produced from the B sections sections B B B B and B . After the selected time heaters in the B sections may be turned on. The size and or number of A and B sections in rectangular checkerboard pattern may be varied depending on factors such as but not limited to heater spacing desired heating rate of the formation desired production rate size of treatment area subsurface geomechanical properties subsurface composition and or other formation properties.

In some embodiments heaters in sections A are turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or sections B. After the selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. After another selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. After another selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. In some embodiments heaters in a B section that has been produced from may be turned on when heaters in the subsequent A section are turned on. For example heaters in section B may be turned on when the heaters in section A are turned on. Other alternating heater startup and production sequences may also be contemplated for the in situ staged heating and production process embodiment depicted in .

In some embodiments the formation is divided into a circular ring or spiral pattern for the staged in situ heating and production process. depicts a top view of the ring pattern embodiment for the staged in situ heating and production process. Sections and may be treated with heater startup and production sequences similar to the sequences described above for the embodiments depicted in . The heater startup and production sequences for the embodiment depicted in may start with section going inwards towards the center or with section going outwards from the center . Starting with section may allow expansion of the formation as heating moves towards the center of the ring pattern. Shearing of the formation may be minimized or inhibited because the formation is allowed to expand into heated and or pyrolyzed portions of the formation. In some embodiments the center section section is cooled after treatment.

In some embodiments fluids are injected to drive fluids between sections of the formation. Injecting fluids such as steam or carbon dioxide may increase the mobility of hydrocarbons and may increase the efficiency of the staged in situ heating and production process. In some embodiments fluids are injected into the formation after the in situ heat treatment process to recover heat from the formation. In some embodiments the fluids injected into the formation for heat recovery include some fluids produced from the formation for example carbon dioxide water and or hydrocarbons produced from the formation . In some embodiments the embodiments depicted in are used for in situ solution mining of the formation. Hot water or another fluid may be used to get permeability in the formation at low temperatures for solution mining.

In certain embodiments several rectangular checkerboard patterns for example rectangular checkerboard pattern depicted in are used to treat a treatment area of the formation. depicts a top view of a plurality of rectangular checkerboard patterns in treatment area for the staged in situ heating and production process. Treatment area may be enclosed by barrier . Each of rectangular checkerboard patterns may individually be treated according to embodiments described above for the rectangular checkerboard patterns.

In certain embodiments the startup of treatment of rectangular checkerboard patterns proceeds in a sequential process. The sequential process may include starting the treatment of each of the rectangular checkerboard patterns one by one sequentially. For example treatment of a second rectangular checkerboard pattern for example the onset of heating of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be started after treatment of a first rectangular checkerboard pattern and so on. The startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be at any point in time after the treatment of the first rectangular checkerboard pattern has begun. The time selected for startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be varied depending on factors such as but not limited to desired heating rate of the formation desired production rate subsurface geomechanical properties subsurface composition and or other formation properties. In some embodiments the startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern begins after a selected amount of fluids have been produced from the first rectangular checkerboard pattern area or after the production rate from the first rectangular checkerboard pattern increases above a selected value or falls below a selected value.

In some embodiments the startup sequence for rectangular checkerboard patterns is arranged to minimize or inhibit expansion stresses in the formation. In an embodiment the startup sequence of the rectangular checkerboard patterns proceeds in an outward spiral sequence as shown by the arrows in . The outward spiral sequence proceeds sequentially beginning with treatment of rectangular checkerboard pattern followed by treatment of rectangular checkerboard pattern rectangular checkerboard pattern rectangular checkerboard pattern and continuing the sequence up to rectangular checkerboard pattern . Sequentially starting the rectangular checkerboard patterns in the outwards spiral sequence may minimize or inhibit expansion stresses in the formation.

Starting treatment in rectangular checkerboard patterns at or near the center of treatment area and moving outwards maximizes the starting distance from barrier . Barrier may be most likely to fail when heat is provided at or near the barrier. Starting treatment heating at or near the center of treatment area delays heating of rectangular checkerboard patterns near barrier until later times of heating in treatment area or at or near the end of production from the treatment area. Thus if barrier does fail the failure of the barrier occurs after a significant portion of treatment area has been treated.

Starting treatment in rectangular checkerboard patterns at or near the center of treatment area and moving outwards also creates open pore space in the inner portions of the outward moving startup pattern. The open pore space allows portions of the formation being started at later times to expand inwards into the open pore space and for example minimize shearing in the formation.

In some embodiments support sections are left between one or more of rectangular checkerboard patterns . The support sections may be unheated sections that provide support against geomechanical shifting shearing and or expansion stress in the formation. In some embodiments some heat may be provided in the support sections. The heat provided in the support sections may be less than heat provided inside rectangular checkerboard patterns . In some embodiments each of the support sections may include alternating heated and unheated sections. In some embodiments fluids are produced from one or more of the unheated support sections.

In some embodiments one or more of rectangular checkerboard patterns have varying sizes. For example the outer rectangular checkerboard patterns such as rectangular checkerboard patterns and rectangular checkerboard patterns may have smaller areas and or numbers of checkerboards. Reducing the area and or the number of checkerboards in the outer rectangular checkerboard patterns may reduce expansion stresses and or geomechanical shifting in the outer portions of treatment area . Reducing the expansion stresses and or geomechanical shifting in the outer portions of treatment area may minimize or inhibit expansion stress and or shifting stress on barrier .

During an in situ heat treatment process some formation fluid may migrate outwards from the treatment area. The formation fluid may include benzene and other contaminants. Some portions of the formation that contaminants migrate to will be subsequently treated when a new treatment area is defined and processed using the in situ heat treatment process. Such contaminants may be removed or destroyed by the subsequent in situ heat treatment process. Some areas of the formation to which contaminants migrate may not become part of a new treatment area subjected to in situ heat treatment. Migration inhibition systems may be implemented to inhibit contaminants from migrating to areas in the formation that are not to be subjected to in situ heat treatment.

In some embodiments a barrier for example a low temperature zone or freeze barrier surrounds at least a portion of the perimeter of a treatment area. The barrier may be 20 m to 100 m from the closest heaters in the treatment area used in the in situ heat treatment process to heat the formation. Some contaminants may migrate outwards toward the barrier through fractures or highly permeable zones and condense in the formation.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments a migration inhibition system may be used to minimize or eliminate migration of formation fluid from the treatment area of the in situ heat treatment process. depicts a representation of a fluid migration inhibition system. Barrier may surround treatment area . Migration inhibition wells may be placed in the formation between barrier and treatment area . Migration inhibition wells may be offset from wells used to heat the formation and or from production wells used to produce fluid from the formation. Migration inhibition wells may be placed in formation that is below pyrolysis and or dissociation temperatures of minerals in the formation.

In some embodiments one or more of the migration inhibition wells include heaters. The heaters may be used to heat portions of the formation adjacent to the wells to a relatively low temperature. The relatively low temperature may be a temperature below a dissociation temperature of minerals in the formation adjacent to the well or below a pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The temperature that the low temperature heater wells raise the formation to may be less than 260 C. less than 230 C. or less than 200 C. In some embodiments heating elements in low temperature wells may be tailored so that the heating elements only heat portions of the formation that have permeability sufficient to allow for the migration of fluid for example fracture systems .

Some or all migration inhibition wells may be injector wells that allow for the introduction of a sweep fluid into the formation. The injector wells may include smart well technology. Sweep fluid may be introduced into the formation through critical orifices perforations or other types of openings in the injector wells. In some embodiments the sweep fluid is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide may be carbon dioxide produced from an in situ heat treatment process. The sweep fluid may be or include other fluids such as nitrogen methane or other non condensable hydrocarbons exhaust gases air and or steam. The sweep fluid may provide positive pressure in the formation outside of treatment area . The positive pressure may inhibit migration of formation fluid from treatment area towards barrier . The sweep fluid may move through fractures in the formation toward or into treatment area . The sweep fluid may carry fluids that have migrated away from treatment area back to the treatment area. The pressure of the fluid introduced through migration inhibition wells may be maintained below the fracture pressure of the formation.

Alternative energy sources may be used to supply electricity for subsurface electric heaters. Alternative energy sources include but are not limited to wind off peak power hydroelectric power geothermal solar and tidal wave action. Some of these alternative energy sources provide intermittent time variable power or power variable power. To provide power for subsurface electric heaters power provided by these alternative energy sources may be conditioned to produce power with appropriate operating parameters for example voltage frequency and or current for the subsurface heaters.

In some embodiments gas turbine is used to generate electricity to power heaters . Windmill and or gas turbine may be coupled to transformer . Transformer may convert power from windmill and or gas turbine into electrical power with appropriate operating parameters for heaters for example AC or DC power with appropriate voltage current and or frequency may be generated by the transformer .

In certain embodiments tap controller is coupled to transformer control system and heaters . Tap controller may monitor and control transformer to maintain a constant voltage to heaters regardless of the load of the heaters. Tap controller may control power output in a range from 5 MVA megavolt amps to 500 MVA from 10 MVA to 400 MVA or from 20 MVA to 300 MVA. As an example during operation an overload of voltage may be sent from transformer . Tap controller may distribute the excess load to other heaters and or other equipment in need of power. In some embodiments tap controller may store the excess load for future use.

Control system may control tap controller . Control system may be for example a computer controller or an analog logic system. Control system may use data supplied from power sensors to generate predictive algorithms and or control tap controller . For example data may be an amount of power generated from windmill gas turbine and or transformer . Data may also include an amount of resistive load of heaters .

Automatic voltage regulation for resistive load of a heater maintains the life of the heaters and or allows constant heat output from the heaters to a subsurface formation. Adjusting the load demands instead of adjusting the power source allows enhanced control of power supplied to heaters and or other equipment that requires electricity. Power supplied to heaters may be controlled within selected limits for example a power supplied and or controlled to a heater within 1 5 10 or 20 of power required by the heater . Control of power supplied from alternative energy sources may allow output of prime power at its rating allow energy produced for example from an intermittent source a subsurface formation or a hydroelectric source to be stored and used later and or allow use of power generated by intermittent power sources to be used as a constant source of energy.

Some hydrocarbon containing formations such as oil shale formations may include nahcolite trona dawsonite and or other minerals within the formation. In some embodiments nahcolite is contained in partially unleached or unleached portions of the formation. Unleached portions of the formation are parts of the formation where minerals have not been removed by groundwater in the formation. For example in the Piceance basin in Colorado U.S.A. unleached oil shale is found below a depth of about 500 m below grade. Deep unleached oil shale formations in the Piceance basin center tend to be relatively rich in hydrocarbons. For example about 0.10 liters to about 0.15 liters of oil per kilogram L kg of oil shale may be producible from an unleached oil shale formation.

Nahcolite is a mineral that includes sodium bicarbonate NaHCO . Nahcolite may be found in formations in the Green River lakebeds in Colorado U.S.A. In some embodiments at least about 5 weight at least about 10 weight or at least about 20 weight nahcolite may be present in the formation. Dawsonite is a mineral that includes sodium aluminum carbonate NaAl CO OH . Dawsonite is typically present in the formation at weight percents greater than about 2 weight or in some embodiments greater than about 5 weight . Nahcolite and or dawsonite may dissociate at temperatures used in an in situ heat treatment process. The dissociation is strongly endothermic and may produce large amounts of carbon dioxide.

Nahcolite and or dawsonite may be solution mined prior to during and or following treatment of the formation in situ to avoid dissociation reactions and or to obtain desired chemical compounds. In certain embodiments hot water or steam is used to dissolve nahcolite in situ to form an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution before the in situ heat treatment process is used to process hydrocarbons in the formation. Nahcolite may form sodium ions Na and bicarbonate ions HCO in aqueous solution. The solution may be produced from the formation through production wells thus avoiding dissociation reactions during the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments dawsonite is thermally decomposed to alumina during the in situ heat treatment process for treating hydrocarbons in the formation. The alumina is solution mined after completion of the in situ heat treatment process.

Production wells and or injection wells used for solution mining and or for in situ heat treatment processes may include smart well technology. The smart well technology allows the first fluid to be introduced at a desired zone in the formation. The smart well technology allows the second fluid to be removed from a desired zone of the formation.

Formations that include nahcolite and or dawsonite may be treated using the in situ heat treatment process. A perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of water into the treatment area. During solution mining and or the in situ heat treatment process the perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of dissolved minerals and formation fluid from the treatment area. During initial heating a portion of the formation to be treated may be raised to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite. The temperature may be at most about 90 C. or in some embodiments at most about 80 C. The temperature may be any temperature that increases the solvation rate of nahcolite in water but is also below a temperature at which nahcolite dissociates above about 95 C. at atmospheric pressure .

A first fluid may be injected into the heated portion. The first fluid may include water brine steam or other fluids that form a solution with nahcolite and or dawsonite. The first fluid may be at an increased temperature for example about 90 C. about 95 C. or about 100 C. The increased temperature may be similar to the temperature of the portion of the formation.

In some embodiments the first fluid is injected at an increased temperature into a portion of the formation that has not been heated by heat sources. The increased temperature may be a temperature below a boiling point of the first fluid for example about 90 C. for water. Providing the first fluid at an increased temperature increases a temperature of a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments additional heat may be provided from one or more heat sources in the formation during and or after injection of the first fluid.

In other embodiments the first fluid is or includes steam. The steam may be produced by forming steam in a previously heated portion of the formation for example by passing water through u shaped wellbores that have been used to heat the formation by heat exchange with fluids produced from the formation and or by generating steam in standard steam production facilities. In some embodiments the first fluid may be fluid introduced directly into a hot portion of the portion and produced from the hot portion of the formation. The first fluid may then be used as the first fluid for solution mining.

In some embodiments heat from a hot previously treated portion of the formation is used to heat water brine and or steam used for solution mining a new portion of the formation. Heat transfer fluid may be introduced into the hot previously treated portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be water steam carbon dioxide and or other fluids. Heat may transfer from the hot formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is produced from the formation through production wells. The heat transfer fluid is sent to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger may heat water brine and or steam used as the first fluid to solution mine the new portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be reintroduced into the heated portion of the formation to produce additional hot heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments heat transfer fluid produced from the formation is treated to remove hydrocarbons or other materials before being reintroduced into the formation as part of a remediation process for the heated portion of the formation.

Steam injected for solution mining may have a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. Injected steam may be at a temperature below 250 C. below 300 C. or below 400 C. The injected steam may be at a temperature of at least 150 C. at least 135 C. or at least 125 C. Injecting steam at pyrolysis temperatures may cause problems as hydrocarbons pyrolyze and hydrocarbon fines mix with the steam. The mixture of fines and steam may reduce permeability and or cause plugging of production wells and the formation. Thus the injected steam temperature is selected to inhibit plugging of the formation and or wells in the formation.

The temperature of the first fluid may be varied during the solution mining process. As the solution mining progresses and the nahcolite being solution mined is farther away from the injection point the first fluid temperature may be increased so that steam and or water that reaches the nahcolite to be solution mined is at an elevated temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite. The steam and or water that reaches the nahcolite is also at a temperature below a temperature that promotes plugging of the formation and or wells in the formation for example the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation .

A second fluid may be produced from the formation following injection of the first fluid into the formation. The second fluid may include material dissolved in the first fluid. For example the second fluid may include carbonic acid or other hydrated carbonate compounds formed from the dissolution of nahcolite in the first fluid. The second fluid may also include minerals and or metals. The minerals and or metals may include sodium aluminum phosphorus and other elements.

Solution mining the formation before the in situ heat treatment process allows initial heating of the formation to be provided by heat transfer from the first fluid used during solution mining Solution mining nahcolite or other minerals that decompose or dissociate by means of endothermic reactions before the in situ heat treatment process avoids having energy supplied to heat the formation being used to support these endothermic reactions. Solution mining allows for production of minerals with commercial value. Removing nahcolite or other minerals before the in situ heat treatment process removes mass from the formation. Thus less mass is present in the formation that needs to be heated to higher temperatures and heating the formation to higher temperatures may be achieved more quickly and or more efficiently. Removing mass from the formation also may increase the permeability of the formation. Increasing the permeability may reduce the number of production wells needed for the in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments solution mining before the in situ heat treatment process reduces the time delay between startup of heating of the formation and production of hydrocarbons by two years or more.

In some formations a portion of the formation with unleached minerals may be below a leached portion of the formation. The unleached portion may be thick and substantially impermeable. A treatment area may be formed in the unleached portion. Unleached portion of the formation to the sides above and or below the treatment area may be used as barriers to fluid flow into and out of the treatment area. A first treatment area may be solution mined to remove minerals increase permeability in the treatment area and or increase the richness of the hydrocarbons in the treatment area. After solution mining the first treatment area in situ heat treatment may be used to treat a second treatment area. In some embodiments the second treatment area is the same as the first treatment area. In some embodiments the second treatment has a smaller volume than the first treatment area so that heat provided by outermost heat sources to the formation do not raise the temperature of unleached portions of the formation to the dissociation temperature of the minerals in the unleached portions.

In some embodiments a leached or partially leached portion of the formation above an unleached portion of the formation may include significant amounts of hydrocarbon materials. An in situ heating process may be used to produce hydrocarbon fluids from the unleached portions and the leached or partially leached portions of the formation. depicts a representation of a formation with unleached zone below leached zone . Unleached zone may have an initial permeability before solution mining of less than 0.1 millidarcy. Solution mining wells may be placed in the formation. Solution mining wells may include smart well technology that allows the position of first fluid entrance into the formation and second flow entrance into the solution mining wells to be changed. Solution mining wells may be used to form first treatment area in unleached zone . Unleached zone may initially be substantially impermeable. Unleached portions of the formation may form a top barrier and side barriers around first treatment area . After solution mining first treatment area the portions of solution mining wells adjacent to the first treatment area may be converted to production wells and or heater wells.

Heat sources in first treatment area may be used to heat the first treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. In some embodiments one or more heat sources are placed in the formation before first treatment area is solution mined. The heat sources may be used to provide initial heating to the formation to raise the temperature of the formation and or to test the functionality of the heat sources. In some embodiments one or more heat sources are installed during solution mining of the first treatment area or after solution mining is completed. After solution mining heat sources may be used to raise the temperature of at least a portion of first treatment area above the pyrolysis and or mobilization temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation to result in the generation of mobile hydrocarbons in the first treatment area.

Barrier wells may be introduced into the formation. Ends of barrier wells may extend into and terminate in unleached zone . Unleached zone may be impermeable. In some embodiments barrier wells are freeze wells. Barrier wells may be used to form a barrier to fluid flow into or out of unleached zone . Barrier wells overburden and the unleached material above first treatment area may define second treatment area . In some embodiments a first fluid may be introduced into second treatment area through solution mining wells to raise the initial temperature of the formation in second treatment area and remove any residual soluble minerals from the second treatment area. In some embodiments the top barrier above first treatment area may be solution mined to remove minerals and combine first treatment area and second treatment area into one treatment area. After solution mining heat sources may be activated to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures.

Water inside treatment area may be pumped out of the treatment area through injection wells and or production wells . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as production wells and vice versa the wells are used as both injection wells and production wells . Water may be pumped out until a production rate of water is low or stops.

Heat may be provided to treatment area from heat sources . Heat sources may be operated at temperatures that do not result in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. In some embodiments treatment area is heated to a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In certain embodiments heat is provided to treatment area from the first fluid injected into the formation. The first fluid may be injected at a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In some embodiments heat sources are installed in treatment area after the treatment area is solution mined. In some embodiments some heat is provided from heaters placed in injection wells and or production wells . A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heat sources .

The first fluid is injected through one or more injection wells . In some embodiments the first fluid is hot water. The first fluid may mix and or combine with non hydrocarbon material that is soluble in the first fluid such as nahcolite to produce a second fluid. The second fluid may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heat sources . Injection wells production wells and or heat sources may be heated during removal of the second fluid. Heating one or more wells during removal of the second fluid may maintain the temperature of the fluid during removal of the fluid from the treatment area above a desired value. After producing a desired amount of the soluble non hydrocarbon material from treatment area solution remaining within the treatment area may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heat sources . The desired amount of the soluble non hydrocarbon material may be less than half of the soluble non hydrocarbon material a majority of the soluble non hydrocarbon material substantially all of the soluble non hydrocarbon material or all of the soluble non hydrocarbon material. Removing soluble non hydrocarbon material may produce a relatively high permeability treatment area .

Hydrocarbons within treatment area may be pyrolyzed and or produced using the in situ heat treatment process following removal of soluble non hydrocarbon materials. The relatively high permeability treatment area allows for easy movement of hydrocarbon fluids in the formation during in situ heat treatment processing. The relatively high permeability treatment area provides an enhanced collection area for pyrolyzed and mobilized fluids in the formation. During the in situ heat treatment process heat may be provided to treatment area from heat sources . A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation through production wells and or heat sources . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as either production wells and or heater wells during the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided to treatment area at or near heat sources when a temperature in the formation is above a temperature sufficient to support oxidation of hydrocarbons. At such a temperature the oxidant reacts with the hydrocarbons to provide heat in addition to heat provided by electrical heaters in heat sources . The controlled amount of oxidant may facilitate oxidation of hydrocarbons in the formation to provide additional heat for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons in the formation. The oxidant may more easily flow through treatment area because of the increased permeability of the treatment area after removal of the non hydrocarbon materials. The oxidant may be provided in a controlled manner to control the heating of the formation. The amount of oxidant provided is controlled so that uncontrolled heating of the formation is avoided. Excess oxidant and combustion products may flow to production wells in treatment area .

Following the in situ heat treatment process treatment area may be cooled by introducing water to produce steam from the hot portion of the formation. Introduction of water to produce steam may vaporize some hydrocarbons remaining in the formation. Water may be injected through injection wells . The injected water may cool the formation. The remaining hydrocarbons and generated steam may be produced through production wells and or heat sources . Treatment area may be cooled to a temperature near the boiling point of water. The steam produced from the formation may be used to heat a first fluid used to solution mine another portion of the formation.

Treatment area may be further cooled to a temperature at which water will condense in the formation. Water and or solvent may be introduced into and be removed from the treatment area. Removing the condensed water and or solvent from treatment area may remove any additional soluble material remaining in the treatment area. The water and or solvent may entrain non soluble fluid present in the formation. Fluid may be pumped out of treatment area through production well and or heat sources . The injection and removal of water and or solvent may be repeated until a desired water quality within treatment area is achieved. Water quality may be measured at injection wells heat sources and or production wells . The water quality may substantially match or exceed the water quality of treatment area prior to treatment.

In some embodiments treatment area may include a leached zone located above an unleached zone. The leached zone may have been leached naturally and or by a separate leaching process. In certain embodiments the unleached zone may be at a depth of at least about 500 m. A thickness of the unleached zone may be between about 100 m and about 500 m. However the depth and thickness of the unleached zone may vary depending on for example a location of treatment area and or the type of formation. In certain embodiments the first fluid is injected into the unleached zone below the leached zone. Heat may also be provided into the unleached zone.

In certain embodiments a section of a formation may be left untreated by solution mining and or unleached. The unleached section may be proximate a selected section of the formation that has been leached and or solution mined by providing the first fluid as described above. The unleached section may inhibit the flow of water into the selected section. In some embodiments more than one unleached section may be proximate a selected section.

Nahcolite may be present in the formation in layers or beds. Prior to solution mining such layers may have little or no permeability. In certain embodiments solution mining layered or bedded nahcolite from the formation causes vertical shifting in the formation. depicts an embodiment of a formation with nahcolite layers in the formation below overburden and before solution mining nahcolite from the formation. Hydrocarbon layers A have substantially no nahcolite and hydrocarbon layers B have nahcolite. depicts the formation of after the nahcolite has been solution mined. Layers B have collapsed due to the removal of the nahcolite from the layers. The collapsing of layers B causes compaction of the layers and vertical shifting of the formation. The hydrocarbon richness of layers B is increased after compaction of the layers. In addition the permeability of layers B may remain relatively high after compaction due to removal of the nahcolite. The permeability may be more than 5 darcy more than 1 darcy or more than 0.5 darcy after vertical shifting. The permeability may provide fluid flow paths to production wells when the formation is treated using an in situ heat treatment process. The increased permeability may allow for a large spacing between production wells. Distances between production wells for the in situ heat treatment system after solution mining may be greater than 10 m greater than 20 m or greater than 30 meters. Heater wells may be placed in the formation after removal of nahcolite and the subsequent vertical shifting. Forming heater wellbores and or installing heaters in the formation after the vertical shifting protects the heaters from being damaged due to the vertical shifting.

In certain embodiments removing nahcolite from the formation interconnects two or more wells in the formation. Removing nahcolite from zones in the formation may increase the permeability in the zones. Some zones may have more nahcolite than others and become more permeable as the nahcolite is removed. At a certain time zones with the increased permeability may interconnect two or more wells for example injection wells or production wells in the formation.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate may be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries in leather tanning in fire retardation in wastewater treatment and in flue gas treatment flue gas desulphurization and hydrogen chloride reduction . The second fluid may be kept pressurized and at an elevated temperature when removed from the formation. The second fluid may be cooled in a crystallizer to precipitate sodium bicarbonate.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium carbonate which is also referred to as soda ash. Sodium carbonate may be used in the manufacture of glass in the manufacture of detergents in water purification polymer production tanning paper manufacturing effluent neutralization metal refining sugar extraction and or cement manufacturing. The second fluid removed from the formation may be heated in a treatment facility to form sodium carbonate soda ash and or sodium carbonate brine. Heating sodium bicarbonate will form sodium carbonate according to the equation 2NaHCO NaCO CO HO. 7 

In certain embodiments the heat for heating the sodium bicarbonate is provided using heat from the formation. For example a heat exchanger that uses steam produced from the water introduced into the hot formation may be used to heat the second fluid to dissociation temperatures of the sodium bicarbonate. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through the formation to utilize heat in the formation for further reaction. Steam and or hot water may also be added to facilitate circulation. The second fluid may be circulated through a heated portion of the formation that has been subjected to the in situ heat treatment process to produce hydrocarbons from the formation. At least a portion of the carbon dioxide generated during sodium carbonate dissociation may be adsorbed on carbon that remains in the formation after the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through conduits previously used to heat the formation.

In some embodiments higher temperatures are used in the formation for example above about 120 C. above about 130 C. above about 150 C. or below about 250 C. during solution mining of nahcolite. The first fluid is introduced into the formation under pressure sufficient to inhibit sodium bicarbonate from dissociating to produce carbon dioxide. The pressure in the formation may be maintained at sufficiently high pressures to inhibit such nahcolite dissociation but below pressures that would result in fracturing the formation. In addition the pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to inhibit steam formation if hot water is being introduced in the formation. In some embodiments a portion of the nahcolite may begin to decompose in situ. In such cases nahcolite is removed from the formation as soda ash. If soda ash is produced from solution mining of nahcolite the soda ash may be transported to a separate facility for treatment. The soda ash may be transported through a pipeline to the separate facility.

As described above in certain embodiments following removal of nahcolite from the formation the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process to produce formation fluids from the formation. If dawsonite is present in the formation dawsonite within the heated portion of the formation decomposes during heating of the formation to pyrolysis temperature. Dawsonite typically decomposes at temperatures above 270 C. according to the reaction 2NaAl OH CO NaCO AlO 2HO CO. 8 

Sodium carbonate may be removed from the formation by solution mining the formation with water or other fluid into which sodium carbonate is soluble. In certain embodiments alumina formed by dawsonite decomposition is solution mined using a chelating agent. The chelating agent may be injected through injection wells production wells and or heater wells used for solution mining nahcolite and or the in situ heat treatment process for example injection wells production wells and or heat sources depicted in . The chelating agent may be an aqueous acid. In certain embodiments the chelating agent is EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid . Other examples of possible chelating agents include but are not limited to ethylenediamine porphyrins dimercaprol nitrilotriacetic acid diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid phosphoric acids acetic acid acetoxy benzoic acids nicotinic acid pyruvic acid citric acid tartaric acid malonic acid imidizole ascorbic acid phenols hydroxy ketones sebacic acid and boric acid. The mixture of chelating agent and alumina may be produced through production wells or other wells used for solution mining and or the in situ heat treatment process for example injection wells production wells and or heat sources which are depicted in . The alumina may be separated from the chelating agent in a treatment facility. The recovered chelating agent may be recirculated back to the formation to solution mine more alumina.

In some embodiments alumina within the formation may be solution mined using a basic fluid after the in situ heat treatment process. Basic fluids include but are not limited to sodium hydroxide ammonia magnesium hydroxide magnesium carbonate sodium carbonate potassium carbonate pyridine and amines. In an embodiment sodium carbonate brine such as 0.5 Normal NaCO is used to solution mine alumina Sodium carbonate brine may be obtained from solution mining nahcolite from the formation. Obtaining the basic fluid by solution mining the nahcolite may significantly reduce costs associated with obtaining the basic fluid. The basic fluid may be injected into the formation through a heater well and or an injection well. The basic fluid may combine with alumina to form an alumina solution that is removed from the formation. The alumina solution may be removed through a heater well injection well or production well.

Alumina may be extracted from the alumina solution in a treatment facility. In an embodiment carbon dioxide is bubbled through the alumina solution to precipitate the alumina from the basic fluid. Carbon dioxide may be obtained from dissociation of nahcolite from the in situ heat treatment process or from decomposition of the dawsonite during the in situ heat treatment process.

In certain embodiments a formation may include portions that are significantly rich in either nahcolite or dawsonite only. For example a formation may contain significant amounts of nahcolite for example at least about 20 weight at least about 30 weight or at least about 40 weight in a depocenter of the formation. The depocenter may contain only about 5 weight or less dawsonite on average. However in bottom layers of the formation a weight percent of dawsonite may be about 10 weight or even as high as about 25 weight . In such formations it may be advantageous to solution mine for nahcolite only in nahcolite rich areas such as the depocenter and solution mine for dawsonite only in the dawsonite rich areas such as the bottom layers. This selective solution mining may significantly reduce fluid costs heating costs and or equipment costs associated with operating the solution mining process.

In certain formations dawsonite composition varies between layers in the formation. For example some layers of the formation may have dawsonite and some layers may not. In certain embodiments more heat is provided to layers with more dawsonite than to layers with less dawsonite. Tailoring heat input to provide more heat to certain dawsonite layers more uniformly heats the formation as the reaction to decompose dawsonite absorbs some of the heat intended for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. depicts an embodiment for heating a formation with dawsonite in the formation. Hydrocarbon layer may be cored to assess the dawsonite composition of the hydrocarbon layer. The mineral composition may be assessed using for example FTIR Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or x ray diffraction. Assessing the core composition may also assess the nahcolite composition of the core. After assessing the dawsonite composition heater may be placed in wellbore . Heater includes sections to provide more heat to hydrocarbon layers with more dawsonite in the layers hydrocarbon layers D . Hydrocarbon layers with less dawsonite hydrocarbon layers C are provided with less heat by heater . Heat output of heater may be tailored by for example adjusting the resistance of the heater along the length of the heater. In one embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater described herein that has a higher temperature limit for example higher Curie temperature in sections proximate layers D as compared to the temperature limit Curie temperature of sections proximate layers C. The resistance of heater may also be adjusted by altering the resistive conducting materials along the length of the heater to supply a higher energy input watts per meter adjacent to dawsonite rich layers.

Solution mining dawsonite and nahcolite may be relatively simple processes that produce alumina and soda ash from the formation. In some embodiments hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ heat treatment process may be fuel for a power plant that produces direct current DC electricity at or near the site of the in situ heat treatment process. The produced DC electricity may be used on the site to produce aluminum metal from the alumina using the Hall process. Aluminum metal may be produced from the alumina by melting the alumina in a treatment facility on the site. Generating the DC electricity at the site may save on costs associated with using hydrotreaters pipelines or other treatment facilities associated with transporting and or treating hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments acid may be introduced into the formation through selected wells to increase the porosity adjacent to the wells. For example acid may be injected if the formation comprises limestone or dolomite. The acid used to treat the selected wells may be acid produced during in situ heat treatment of a section of the formation for example hydrochloric acid or acid produced from byproducts of the in situ heat treatment process for example sulfuric acid produced from hydrogen sulfide or sulfur .

In some embodiments a perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be a frozen barrier and or a grout barrier. After formation of the perimeter barrier the treatment area may be processed to produce desired products.

Formations that include non hydrocarbon materials may be treated to remove and or dissolve a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials from a section of the formation before hydrocarbons are produced from the section. In some embodiments the non hydrocarbon materials are removed by solution mining. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may reduce the carbon dioxide generation sources present in the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may increase the porosity and or permeability of the section of the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may result in a raised temperature in the section of the formation.

After solution mining some of the wells in the treatment may be converted to heater wells injection wells and or production wells. In some embodiments additional wells are formed in the treatment area. The wells may be heater wells injection wells and or production wells. Logging techniques may be employed to assess the physical characteristics including any vertical shifting resulting from the solution mining and or the composition of material in the formation. Packing baffles or other techniques may be used to inhibit formation fluid from entering the heater wells. The heater wells may be activated to heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to support combustion.

One or more production wells may be positioned in permeable sections of the treatment area. Production wells may be horizontally and or vertically oriented. For example production wells may be positioned in areas of the formation that have a permeability of greater than 5 darcy or 10 darcy. In some embodiments production wells may be positioned near a perimeter barrier. A production well may allow water and production fluids to be removed from the formation. Positioning the production well near a perimeter barrier enhances the flow of fluids from the warmer zones of the formation to the cooler zones.

Heat may be provided to treatment area through heaters positioned in injection wells . In some embodiments the heaters in injection wells heat formation adjacent to the injections wells to temperatures sufficient to support combustion. Heaters in injection wells may raise the formation near the injection wells to temperatures from about 90 C. to about 120 C. or higher for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. .

Injection wells may be used to introduce a combustion fuel an oxidant steam and or a heat transfer fluid into treatment area either before during or after heat is provided to the treatment area from heaters. In some embodiments injection wells are in communication with each other to allow the introduced fluid to flow from one well to another. Injection wells may be located at positions that are relatively far away from perimeter barrier . Introduced fluid may cause combustion of hydrocarbons in treatment area . Heat from the combustion may heat treatment area and mobilize fluids toward production wells .

A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heater wells.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided in injection wells to advance a heat front towards production wells . In some embodiments the controlled amount of oxidant is introduced into the formation after solution mining has established permeable interconnectivity between at least two injection wells. The amount of oxidant is controlled to limit the advancement rate of the heat front and to limit the temperature of the heat front. The advancing heat front may pyrolyze hydrocarbons. The high permeability in the formation allows the pyrolyzed hydrocarbons to spread in the formation towards production wells without being overtaken by the advancing heat front.

Vaporized formation fluid and or gas formed during the combustion process may be removed through gas wells and or injection well . Venting of gases through the gas wells and or the injection well may force the combustion front in a desired direction.

In some embodiments the formation may be heated to a temperature sufficient to cause pyrolysis of the formation fluid by the steam and or heat transfer fluid. The steam and or heat transfer fluid may be heated to temperatures of about 300 C. about 400 C. about 500 C. or about 600 C. In certain embodiments the steam and or heat transfer fluid may be co injected with the fuel and or oxidant.

Carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be produced during in situ heat treatment processes and during many conventional production processes. Removal of hydrogen sulfide from produced formation fluid may reduce the toxicity and or strong odor in the produced formation fluid thus making the formation fluid more acceptable for transportation and or processing. Removing carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide from produced formation fluids may reduce capital costs associated with removing the fluids and reduce or eliminate the need for certain surface facilities for example a Claus plant or Scot gas treater . Since carbon dioxide has a low heating value removal of carbon dioxide from formation fluids may increase the heat capacity of a gas stream separated from the formation fluid.

Net release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and or hydrogen sulfide conversion to sulfur from an in situ heat treatment process for hydrocarbons may be reduced by utilizing the produced carbon dioxide and or by storing carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide within the formation or within another formation. Carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be introduced into a portion of the formation below treatment areas subjected to in situ heat treatment processes. In some embodiments the carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be transported to another formation.

In certain embodiments carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be stored in spent portions of formations that have previously been subjected to in situ heat treatment processes or other hydrocarbon recovery processes. Carbon dioxide may absorb on or into remaining carbon containing material in such formations.

In certain embodiments carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide is stored in a porous deep saline aquifer. The carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may promote mineralization within the aquifer. For example the introduction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into a saline aquifer may result in the production of carbonates in the aquifer. In certain embodiments carbon dioxide is stored at a depth in the formation such that the carbon dioxide is introduced in the formation in a supercritical state. Supercritical carbon dioxide injection may maximize the density of the fluid introduced into the formation. The depths of outlets of insertion wells used to introduce carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide in the formation may be 900 m or more below the surface. The injection wells may be vertical slanted or directionally steered wells with a significant horizontal or near horizontal portion. The carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide may be introduced into the formation near the bottom of the saline aquifer.

During production of formation fluids from a subsurface formation carbonic acid may be produced from the reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Portions of wells made of certain materials such as carbon steel may start to deteriorate or corrode in the presence of the carbonic acid. To inhibit corrosion due to carbonic acid basic solutions and or solvents may be introduced in the wellbore to neutralize and or dissolve the carbonic acid.

In some embodiments hydrogen sulfide is introduced into one or more wellbores in a subsurface formation. Introduction of the hydrogen sulfide may be performed at pressures below the lithostatic pressure of the subsurface formation to inhibit fracturing the formation. The injected hydrogen sulfide may form a sulfide layer on metal surfaces of the well. Formation of a sulfide layer may inhibit corrosion of the metal surfaces of the well by carbonic acid.

In certain embodiments an electrical insulator for example a centralizer an insulating layer the electrical insulator in an insulated conductor heater or any other electrical insulator described herein includes a material that is fired or cured when heated in the subsurface. The material may develop desired dielectric or other electrical properties and or physical properties after the material is fired or cured in a wellbore in the formation. The material may be fired or cured when a heater is turned on in the wellbore and the heater heats the material to its firing or curing temperature.

An example of such a material is a ceramic tape available from Composite Development Technology Inc. Lafayette Colo. U.S.A. . The ceramic tape is flexible before it is fired. The ceramic tape obtains its dielectric properties after firing. After firing the ceramic tape is a hard ceramic with good dielectric properties suitable for subsurface electrical heating.

In an embodiment the ceramic tape is wrapped around an electrical conductor for example the conductor of a temperature limited heater . Electrical current may be applied to the electrical conductor to heat the heater and fire the ceramic tape. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is pre fired before installation of a heater. The ceramic tape may be pre fired using for example a hot gas gun.

Before firing the ceramic tape is flexible and easy to install in a variety of applications. In certain embodiments the ceramic tape is used between centralizers in a conductor in conduit heater. The ceramic tape may inhibit shorting of the conductor and conduit if the centralizers fail for example if the centralizers buckle and fail . In certain embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the centralizers in a conductor in conduit heater. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the electrical insulator in an insulated conductor heater. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used as the electrical insulator in splices between sections of heaters. In some embodiments the ceramic tape is used to electrically insulate the legs of a three phase heater. The three legs of the three phase heater may be enclosed in one sheath with the ceramic tape separating the legs of the heater.

A 6 foot temperature limited heater element was placed in a 6 foot 347H stainless steel canister. The heater element was connected to the canister in a series configuration. The heater element and canister were placed in an oven. The oven was used to raise the temperature of the heater element and the canister. At varying temperatures a series of electrical currents were passed through the heater element and returned through the canister. The resistance of the heater element and the power factor of the heater element were determined from measurements during passing of the electrical currents.

Data depicts electrical resistance versus temperature for 300 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 500 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC applied current. The resistance versus temperature data indicates that the AC resistance of the temperature limited heater linearly increased up to a temperature near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Near the Curie temperature the AC resistance decreased rapidly until the AC resistance equaled the DC resistance above the Curie temperature. The linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature at least partially reflects the linear dependence of the AC resistance of 347H at these temperatures. Thus the linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures.

Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 100 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC. The AC resistance of this temperature limited heater turned down at a higher temperature than the previous temperature limited heater. This was due to the added cobalt increasing the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The AC resistance was substantially the same as the AC resistance of a tube of 347H steel having the dimensions of the support member. This indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures. The resistance curves in are generally the same shape as the resistance curves in .

From the data in the experiments for the temperature limited heater with the copper core the iron cobalt ferromagnetic conductor and the 347H stainless steel support member the turndown ratio y axis was calculated as a function of the maximum power W m delivered by the temperature limited heater. The results of these calculations are depicted in . The curve in shows that the turndown ratio y axis remains above 2 for heater powers up to approximately 2000 W m. This curve is used to determine the ability of a heater to effectively provide heat output in a sustainable manner. A temperature limited heater with the curve similar to the curve in would be able to provide sufficient heat output while maintaining temperature limiting properties that inhibit the heater from overheating or malfunctioning.

A theoretical model has been used to predict the experimental results. The theoretical model is based on an analytical solution for the AC resistance of a composite conductor. The composite conductor has a thin layer of ferromagnetic material with a relative magnetic permeability 1 sandwiched between two non ferromagnetic materials whose relative magnetic permeabilities and are close to unity and within which skin effects are negligible. An assumption in the model is that the ferromagnetic material is treated as linear. In addition the way in which the relative magnetic permeability is extracted from magnetic data for use in the model is far from rigorous.

Magnetic data was obtained for carbon steel as a ferromagnetic material. B versus H curves and hence relative permeabilities were obtained from the magnetic data at various temperatures up to 1100 F. and magnetic fields up to 2000e oersteds . A correlation was found that fitted the data well through the maximum permeability and beyond. depicts examples of relative magnetic permeability y axis versus magnetic field Oe for both the found correlations and raw data for carbon steel. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 400 F. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 1000 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 400 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 1000 F.

For the dimensions and materials of the copper carbon steel 347H heater element in the experiments above theoretical calculations were carried out to calculate magnetic field at the outer surface of the carbon steel as a function of skin depth. Results of the theoretical calculations were presented on the same plot as skin depth versus magnetic field from the correlations applied to the magnetic data from . The theoretical calculations and correlations were made for four temperatures 200 F. 500 F. 800 F. and 1100 F. and five total root mean square RMS currents 100 A 200 A 300 A 400 A and 500 A .

The skin depths obtained from the intersections of the same temperature curves in were input into equations based on theory and the AC resistance per unit length was calculated. The total AC resistance of the entire heater including that of the canister was subsequently calculated. A comparison between the experimental and numerical calculated results is shown in for currents of 300 A experimental data and numerical curve 400 A experimental data and numerical curve and 500 A experimental data and numerical curve . Though the numerical results exhibit a steeper trend than the experimental results the theoretical model captures the close bunching of the experimental data and the overall values are quite reasonable given the assumptions involved in the theoretical model. For example one assumption involved the use of a permeability derived from a quasistatic B H curve to treat a dynamic system.

One feature of the theoretical model describing the flow of alternating current in the three part temperature limited heater is that the AC resistance does not fall off monotonically with increasing skin depth. shows the AC resistance m per foot of the heater element as a function of skin depth in. at 1100 F. calculated from the theoretical model. The AC resistance may be maximized by selecting the skin depth that is at the peak of the non monotonical portion of the resistance versus skin depth profile for example at about 0.23 in. in .

A numerical simulation FLUENT available from Fluent USA Lebanon N.H. U.S.A. was used to compare operation of temperature limited heaters with three turndown ratios. The simulation was done for heaters in an oil shale formation Green River oil shale . Simulation conditions were 

Simulations have been performed to compare the use of temperature limited heaters and non temperature limited heaters in an oil shale formation. Simulation data was produced for conductor in conduit heaters placed in 16.5 cm 6.5 inch diameter wellbores with 12.2 m 40 feet spacing between heaters using a formation simulator for example STARS and a near wellbore simulator for example ABAQUS from ABAQUS Inc. Providence R.I. U.S.A. . Standard conductor in conduit heaters included 304 stainless steel conductors and conduits. Temperature limited conductor in conduit heaters included a metal with a Curie temperature of 760 C. for conductors and conduits. Results from the simulations are depicted in .

Calculations for the Curie temperature T and the phase transformation behavior were done for various mixtures of cobalt carbon manganese silicon vanadium and titanium using computational thermodynamic software ThermoCalc and JMatPro obtained from Thermo Calc Software Inc. McMurray Pa. U.S.A to predict the effect of additional elements on Curie Temperature T for selected compositions the temperature A at which ferrite transforms to paramagnetic austenite and the phases present at those temperatures. An equilibrium calculation temperature of 700 C. was used in all calculations. As shown in TABLE 2 as the weight percentage of cobalt in the composition increased Tand Aincreased however Tremained above A. An increase in the Atemperature may be predicted upon sufficient addition of carbide formers vanadium titanium niobium tantalum and tungsten. For example about 0.5 by weight of carbide formers may be used in an alloy that includes about 0.1 by weight of carbon. Addition of carbide formers allows replacement of the FeC carbide phase with a MC carbide phase. From the calculations excess amounts of vanadium appeared to not have an impact on T while excess amounts of other carbide formers reduced the T.

Several iron cobalt alloys were prepared and their compositions are given in TABLE 3. These cast alloys were processed into rod and wire and the measured and calculated Tfor the rods is listed. Averages of cooling and heating Tmeasurements were used since no irreversible hysteresis effect was observed during heating and cooling. As shown in TABLE 3 the agreement between calculated Tand the measured Twas acceptable.

The measured Twere performed by inserting rods into a furnace and the Ttemperature was measured during heating. A thermocouple was attached midway along the length. The torus technique involves winding a torus with the sample material.

Calculations for the Curie temperature and the phase transformation behavior were done for various mixtures of cobalt carbon manganese silicon vanadium and titanium using the computational thermodynamic software ThermoCalc and JmatPro to predict the effect of additional elements on Curie Temperature T for selected compositions and the temperature A at which ferrite transforms to paramagnetic austenite. An equilibrium calculation temperature of 700 C. was used in all calculations. As shown in TABLE 4 as the weight percentage of cobalt in the composition increased Tand Adecreased. As shown in TABLE 4 addition of vanadium and or titanium increased A. The addition of vanadium may allow increased amounts of chromium to be used in Curie heaters.

Several iron chromium alloys were prepared and their compositions are given in TABLE 5. These cast alloys were processed into rod and torus and the calculated and measured Tfor the torus and rods is listed.

Modeling of phase behavior for different improved alloy compositions to determine compositions that contain increased amounts of phases that contribute positively to physical properties was performed. Compositions such as Cu Z M C N M C N and MC and may minimize the amount of phases that are embritting phases such as G sigma laves and chi. There may be other reasons to include certain components. For example silicon is typically included in stainless steel alloys to improve processing properties and nickel and chromium are typically included in the alloys to impart corrosion resistance. When two components may be included to accomplish the same result then the less expensive component may be beneficially included. For example to the extent manganese may be substituted for nickel without sacrificing performance such a substitution may reduce the cost of the alloy at current component prices.

The effect of total phase content of the alloys similar to those described above has been found to be approximated by the equation 1.0235 5.5603 10 

Where is the creep rupture strength for one thousand hours at 800 C. in kilo pound per square inch ksi and TPC is the total phase content calculated for the composition. This estimate was further improved by only including in the TPC term the amount of Cu phase Z phase M C N phase M C N phase and MCphase the desirable phases and calculating the constants on this basis. Another improvement to this estimate may be to use only the difference between the desirable phases present at the annealing temperature and at 800 C. Thus the components that do not go into solution in the annealing process were not considered because they do not add significantly to the strength of the alloys at elevated temperatures. For example the difference between the amount of Cu phase Z phase M C N phase M C N phase and MCphase present based on equilibrium calculations at annealing temperatures less the amount calculated to be present at 800 C. may be about 1 by weight of the alloy or it could be about 1.5 by weight of the alloy or about 2 by weight of the alloy to result in an alloy with good high temperature strength. Further the annealing temperature may be about 1200 C. or it may be about 1250 C. or it may be about 1300 C.

The improved alloys of the present invention may be further understood by modelling the addition or reduction of different metals to determine the effect of changing amounts of that metal on the phase content of the alloy. For example with a starting composition by weight of 20 Cr 3 Cu 4 Mn 0.3 Mo 0.8 Nb 12.5 Ni 0.5 Si 1 W 0.1 C and 0.25 N modeling with varying amounts of Cr results in included phases of MC M C N M C N Z Cu chi laves G and sigma at 800 C. according to . The amount of these phases plotted in each of is the calculated amount of these phases at 800 C. In curve refers to MC curve refers to M C N phase curve refers to Z phase curve refers to Cu phase curve refers to sigma phase curve refers to chi phase curve refers to G phase curve refers to laves phase and curve refers to M C N phase.

Alloys A through N were prepared according to TABLE 6. Measured compositions are included in the table when such measurements are available. The total phase content of the alloys are calculated for the composition listed.

To determine the capability for alloys to be hot worked samples of alloys C D E F K and L in TABLE 6 were prepared by arc melting one pound samples into ingots of about 25.4 millimeter 24.4 millimeter 101.6 millimeter 1 inch 1 inch 4 inch . After cutting hot tops and removing some shrinkage underneath each sample was homogenized at 1200 C. for one hour and then hot rolled to a thickness of about 12.7 millimeter 0.5 inch at 1200 C. with intermediate heat. The samples were then cold rolled to a 6.34 millimeter 0.25 inch thick plate and vacuum annealed at 1200 C. for one hour. The compositions of the samples are included in TABLE 7 below with the balance of the compositions being iron.

When alloy D was hot rolled it cracked and the rolling to 12.7 millimeter 0.5 inch thickness could not be accomplished. Alloy L could be hot rolled but developed cracks from the edge of the samples progressing toward the center of the sample and would not be a useful material after such hot rolling. The other samples were processed using the above described procedure without any problems resulting in 6.35 millimeter 0.25 inch plates that were free of cracks. It has been found that even 0.07 by weight niobium in the alloy composition may significantly reduce the tendency of the alloy to develop cracks during hot working and about 0.5 by weight to about 1.2 by weight niobium can be incorporated in wrought alloys to improve properties such as hot workability.

Samples of alloys A and B from TABLE 6 were processed by two different methods. Process A included a heat treating and an annealing step which were at 1200 C. Process B included a heat treating and an annealing step which were at 1250 C. With the higher heat treating and annealing temperatures measurable improvements in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were observed for the two alloys when processed at the higher temperature.

The process with 1200 C. processing was accomplished as follows sections of six inch ID by 1.5 inches thick centrifugally cast pipe were homogenized at 1200 C. for one and a half hours a section was then hot rolled at 1200 C. to a one inch thickness for alloy A and a three quarter inch thickness for alloy B after cooling to room temperature the plates were given a fifteen minute anneal at 1200 C. the plates were then cold rolled to a thickness of 13.97 millimeter 0.55 inches the cold rolled plates were given an anneal for one hour at 1200 C. in air with an argon blanket and the plates were then given a final anneal for one hour at 1250 C. in air with an argon blanket. This process is referred to herein as process A.

The process with higher heat treating and annealing temperatures varied from the above procedure by homogenization of the cast plates at 1250 C. for three hours instead of one and a half hours hot rolling was carried out at 1200 C. from a one and a 12.7 millimeter 0.5 inch thickness to a 19.05 millimeter 0.75 inch thickness and the resulting plate was annealed for fifteen minute at 1200 C. followed by cold rolling to 13.97 millimeter 0.55 inch thickness. This process is referred to herein as process B.

Samples of Alloy B treated by process A and by process B were subjected to stress rupture tests and the results are tabulated in TABLE 7. It can be seen from Table 7 that process B with a higher annealing temperature resulted in about 47 to about 474 improvement in time to rupture.

A sample of alloy B processed by process B was aged at 750 C. for 1000 hours after being cold worked by 2.5 5 and 10 and without cold working. After aging each was tested for tensile strength and yield strength at about 750 C. Results are tabulated in TABLE 8. It can be seen from TABLE 8 that the yield strength increased significantly as a result of cold work and high temperature aging. The ultimate tensile strength at about 750 C. decreased only slightly as a result of the high temperature aging and cold working. The annealed only sample and the aged only sample were also tested at room temperature for yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. The yield strength at room temperature increased from 307 MPa to 318 MPa as a result of the aging. The ultimate tensile strength decreased from 720 MPa to 710 MPa as a result of the high temperature aging.

These characteristics may be compared to competing alloys such as 347H which significantly lose high temperature properties as a result of only for example 10 cold work. Because fabrication of tubulars and heaters useful in an in situ heat treatment process often require cold work for their fabrication improvement of some high temperature properties or at least lack of significant loss of high temperature properties may be a significant advantage for alloys having these characteristics. It may be particularly advantageous when these properties are improved or at least not significantly decreased by high temperature aging.

Samples of alloys were subjected to 100 MPa stress at 800 C. in a nitrogen with about 0.1 oxygen test environment. Each of the samples were first annealed for one hour at 1200 C. TABLE 9 shows the time to rupture elongation at rupture and total phase content where the total phase content is known.

A sample of the improved alloy B was rolled processed and rolled into a tube. The seam was welded to form a 31.75 millimeter 1.25 inch OD pipe. The pipe was then cut and welded back together in order to test the strength of the weld. The filler metal was ERNiCrMo 3 and the weld was completed with argon shielding gas and three passes with a preheat minimum temperature of about 50 C. and an interpass maximum temperature of about 350 C. Creep failure was tested for the segment of welded pipe at 44.8 MPa and 900 C. A rupture time of 41 hours was measured with failure at a strain of 5.5 . This demonstrated that the weld including the heat affected zone around the weld was not significantly weaker than the base alloy.

In some embodiments cobalt is added to 410 stainless steel to decrease the rate of corrosion at elevated temperatures for example temperatures greater than 1200 F. relative to untreated 410 stainless steel. Addition of cobalt to 410 stainless steel may enhance the strength of the stainless steel at high temperatures for example temperatures greater than 1200 F. greater than 1400 F. greater than 1500 F. or greater than 1600 F. and or change the magnetic characteristics of the metal. depicts projected corrosion rates metal loss per year for 410 stainless steel and 410 stainless steel containing various amounts of cobalt in a sulfidation atmosphere. The metals were exposed to the same conditions as the metals in . Bars depict data for 410 stainless steel. Bar depicts data for 410 stainless steel with 2.5 cobalt by weight. Bar depicts data for 410 stainless steel with 5 cobalt by weight. Bar depicts data for 410 stainless steel with 10 cobalt by weight. As shown in as the amount of cobalt in the 410 stainless steel increases the corrosion rate in a sulfidation atmosphere decreases relative to non cobalt containing 410 stainless steel in a temperature range of about 800 C. to about 880 C.

A STARS simulation determined heating properties using temperature limited heaters with varying power outputs. depicts an example of richness of an oil shale formation gal ton versus depth ft . Upper portions of the formation above about 1210 feet tend to have a leaner richness lower water filled porosity and or less dawsonite than deeper portions of the formation. For the simulation a heater similar to the heater depicted in was used. Portion had a length of 368 feet above the dashed line shown in and portion had a length of 587 feet below the dashed line.

In the first example the temperature limited heater had constant thermal properties along the entire length of the heater. The heater included a 14.34 millimeter 0.565 inch diameter copper core with a carbon steel conductor Curie temperature of 1418 F. pure iron with outside diameter of 20.955 millimeter 0.825 inch surrounding the copper core. The outer conductor was 347H stainless steel surrounding the carbon steel conductor with an outside diameter of 31.75 millimeter 1.2 inch . The resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. profile of the heater is shown in . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the first example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the entire formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation lagged behind the average temperature in the top portion of the formation and the entire formation. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1584 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1922 days. Thus the bottom portion lagged behind the top portion by almost a year to reach an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature.

In the second example portion of the temperature limited heater had the same properties used in the first example. Portion of the heater was altered to have a Curie temperature of 843 C. 1550 F. by the addition of cobalt to the iron conductor. depicts resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. for the second heater example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the top portion portion . Curve depicts the resistance profile for the bottom portion portion . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the second example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the entire formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation lagged behind the average temperature in the top portion of the formation and the entire formation. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1574 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1701 days. Thus the bottom portion still lagged behind the top portion to reach an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature but the time lag was less than the time lag in the first example.

In the third example dimensions of the top portion portion were altered to provide less power output. Portion was adjusted to have a copper core with an outside diameter of 13.84 millimeter 0.545 inch a carbon steel conductor with an outside diameter of 17.78 millimeter 0.700 inch surrounding the copper core and an outer conductor of 347H stainless steel with an outside diameter of 30.48 millimeter 1.2 inch surrounding the carbon steel conductor. The bottom portion portion had the same properties as the heater in the second example. depicts resistance per foot m ft versus temperature F. for the third heater example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the top portion portion . Curve depicts the resistance profile of the top portion in the second example. Curve depicts the resistance profile for the bottom portion portion . depicts average temperature in the formation F. versus time days as determined by the simulation for the third example. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the top portion of the formation. Curve depicts average temperature versus time for the bottom portion of the formation. As shown the average temperature in the bottom portion of the formation was approximately the same as the average temperature in the top portion of the formation especially after a time of about 1000 days. The top portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1642 days. The bottom portion of the formation reached an average temperature of 340 C. 644 F. in 1649 days. Thus the bottom portion reached an average temperature near a pyrolysis temperature only 5 days later than the top portion.

As a fourth example the STARS simulation was used to determine heating properties of temperature limited heaters with varying power outputs when using the temperature limited heaters in the heater configuration and pattern depicted in . The heater pattern had a 30 foot heater spacing. Portion had a length of 368 feet and portion had a length of 587 feet as in the previous examples. Portion included a solid 410 stainless steel conductor with an outside diameter of 31.75 millimeter 1.25 inch . Portion included a solid 410 stainless steel conductor with 9 by weight cobalt added. The Curie temperature of portion is 110 C. 230 F. higher than the Curie temperature of portion .

A STARS simulation was used to simulate heating of a tar sands formation using the heater well pattern depicted in . The heaters had a horizontal length in the tar sands formation of 600 m. The heating rate of the heaters was about 750 W m. Production well B depicted in was used at the production well in the simulation. The bottom hole pressure in the horizontal production well was maintained at about 690 kPa. The tar sands formation properties were based on Athabasca tar sands. Input properties for the tar sands formation simulation included initial porosity equals 0.28 initial oil saturation equals 0.8 initial water saturation equals 0.2 initial gas saturation equals 0.0 initial vertical permeability equals 250 millidarcy initial horizontal permeability equals 500 millidarcy initial K Kequals 0.5 hydrocarbon layer thickness equals 28 m depth of hydrocarbon layer equals 587 m initial reservoir pressure equals 3771 kPa distance between production well and lower boundary of hydrocarbon layer equals 2.5 meter distance of topmost heaters and overburden equals 9 meter spacing between heaters equals 9.5 meter initial hydrocarbon layer temperature equals 18.6 C. viscosity at initial temperature equals 53 Pa s 53000 cp and gas to oil ratio GOR in the tar equals 50 standard cubic feet standard barrel. The heaters were constant wattage heaters with a highest temperature of 538 C. at the sand face and a heater power of 755 W m. The heater wells had a diameter of 15.2 cm.

From the STARS simulation the ratio of energy out produced oil and gas energy content versus energy in heater input into the formation was calculated to be about 12 to 1 after about 5 years. The total recovery percentage of oil in place was calculated to be about 60 after about 5 years. Thus producing oil from a tar sands formation using an embodiment of the heater and production well pattern depicted in may produce high oil recoveries and high energy out to energy in ratios.

A liquid sample 500 mL 398.68 grams was obtained from an in situ heat treatment process. The liquid sample contained 0.0069 grams of sulfur and 0.0118 grams of nitrogen per gram of liquid sample. The final boiling point of the liquid sample was 481 C. and the liquid sample had a density of 0.8474 g mL. The membrane separation unit used to filter the sample was a laboratory flat sheet membrane installation type P28 as obtained from CM Celfa Membrantechnik A.G. Switzerland . A single 2 micron thick poly di methyl siloxane membrane GKSS Forschungszentrum GmbH Geesthact Germany was used as the filtration medium. The filtration system was operated at 50 C. and a pressure difference over the membrane was 10 bar. The pressure at the permeate side was nearly atmospheric. The permeate was collected and recycled through the filtration system to simulate a continuous process. The permeate was blanketed with nitrogen to prevent contact with ambient air. The retentate was also collected for analysis. During filtration the average flux of 2 kg m bar hr did not measurably decline from an initial flux during the filtration. The filtered liquid 298.15 grams 74.7 recovery contained 0.007 grams of sulfur and 0.0124 grams of nitrogen per gram of filtered liquid and the filtered liquid had a density of 0.8459 g mL and a final boiling point of 486 C. The retentate 56.46 grams 14.16 recovery contained 0.0076 grams of sulfur and 0.0158 grams of nitrogen per gram of retentate and the retentate had a density of 0.8714 g mL and a final boiling point of 543 C.

The unfiltered and filtered liquid samples from previous the Example were tested for fouling behavior. Fouling behavior was determined using an Alcor thermal fouling tester. The Alcor thermal fouling tester is a miniature shell and tube heat exchanger made of 1018 steel which was grated with Norton R222 sandpaper before use. During the test the sample outlet temperature T was monitored while the heat exchanger temperature T was kept at a constant value. If fouling occurs and material is deposited on the tube surface the heat resistance of the sample increases and consequently the outlet temperature decreases. Hence the decrease in outlet temperature after a given period of time is a measure of fouling severity. The temperature decrease after two hours of operation is used as fouling severity indicator. T T T. Tis defined as the maximum stable outlet temperature obtained at the start of the test Tis recorded 2 hours after the first noted decrease of the outlet temperature or when the outlet temperature has been stable for at least 2 hours.

During each test the liquid sample was continuously circulated through the heat exchanger at approximately 3 mL min. The residence time in the heat exchanger was about 10 seconds. The operating conditions were as follows 40 bar of pressure Twas about 50 C. Twas 350 C. test time was 4.41 hours. The T for the unfiltered liquid stream sample was 15 C. The T for the filtered sample was zero.

This example demonstrates that nanofiltration of a liquid stream produced from an in situ heat treatment process removes at least a portion of clogging compositions.

An experimental pilot system was used to conduct the experiments. The pilot system included a feed supply system a catalyst loading and transfer system a fast fluidized riser reactor a stripper a product separation and collecting system and a regenerator. The riser reactor was an adiabatic riser having an inner diameter of from 11 mm to 19 mm and a length of about 3.2 m. The riser reactor outlet was in fluid communication with the stripper that was operated at the same temperature as the riser reactor outlet flow and in a manner to provide essentially 100 percent stripping efficiency. The regenerator was a multi stage continuous regenerator used for regenerating the spent catalyst. The spent catalyst was fed to the regenerator at a controlled rate and the regenerated catalyst was collected in a vessel. Material balances were obtained during each of the experimental runs at 30 minute intervals. Composite gas samples were analyzed by use of an on line gas chromatograph and the liquid product samples were collected and analyzed overnight. The coke yield was measured by measuring the catalyst flow and by measuring the delta coke on the catalyst as determined by measuring the coke on the spent and regenerated catalyst samples taken for each run when the unit was operating at steady state.
