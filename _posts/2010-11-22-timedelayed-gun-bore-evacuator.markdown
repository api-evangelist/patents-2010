The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to large caliber gun tubes such as cannons.

Bore evacuators may be used on large caliber cannons. Bore evacuators may be used to remove propellant gases from the gun bore of the cannon after firing. The gun may be attached to a vehicle that may be manned. The rear of the gun may include a breech. The breech may be located inside a crew compartment. Flash back in the crew compartment may be a hazard. Exposure of the crew to toxic propellant gases may be a hazard.

Some bore evacuator systems may use a reservoir to store high pressure propellant gases. Ports or nozzles may be located in the gun tube to charge and discharge the reservoir. The gun may include a means to quickly open the breech of the gun. The breech may be opened shortly after firing the gun on return of the gun to battery.

A bore evacuator may use an ejector principle. The reservoir may be charged with high pressure gas as soon as the projectile passes the ports in the gun tube. When pressure in the gun tube falls below the pressure in the reservoir the high pressure gas may begin to exit the reservoir through the ports in the gun tube. Gas may begin exiting the reservoir about 20 to 50 milliseconds after firing of the gun. As the gas flow begins to exit the ports the breech of the gun may not be open.

At approximately 500 milliseconds after firing the gun the breech may be opened. The breech may be opened by an automatic action as the gun returns to battery. As a result of the breech not opening for about 400 500 milliseconds after gas begins to flow out of the reservoir no fresh air may be drawn into the gun tube. As a result no propellant gases may be expended from the gun tube. The ports between the gun tube and the reservoir may not provide an ejector action to the propellant gases. The lack of ejector action may be because the pressure difference or suction provided by the ports may not be equalized by drawing fresh air in the gun tube.

When the breech does open most of the gas may have been exhausted from the reservoir. What little gas pressure remains in the reservoir may then be used to provide ejector action to the gases in the gun tube. As the gas stored in the reservoir flows from the reservoir through the ports and into the gun tube the stored gas may entrain the propellant gas inside the gun tube and push the propellant gas out of the muzzle end of the tube. As a result fresh air may be drawn into the gun tube through the open breech. A known ejector system used in a bore evacuator may draw about 10 to 15 times as much gas through the gun tube as the amount of stored gas that may be injected from the reservoir through the ports in the side of the gun tube. Because of the ejector mechanism bore evacuators may be an efficient mechanism to evacuate propellant gases from a gun bore.

Because of the long delay of about 400 500 milliseconds between when the stored gas begins to flow from the reservoir and when the breech opens various methods for improving the performance of bore evacuators have been tried. One method may be to increase the reservoir size such that a sufficient amount of stored gas remains in the reservoir when the breech is opened. Using this method bore evacuators may be significantly oversized.

Another method may be to provide a larger intake port cross sectional area into the reservoir compared to the discharge port cross sectional area out of the reservoir. Intake port cross sectional area may be increased by adding more charging ports that contain check valves.

Another approach may be to use a small high pressure chamber that has a check valve connected to a low pressure chamber. The intake charging ports may be connected to the high pressure chamber and the discharge ports may be connected to the low pressure chamber. As a result a higher charge volume and or mass may be obtained for a given discharge port charge area. The higher charge volume or mass may provide a higher pressure at the discharge ports during discharge of the evacuator.

An important factor may be the ratio of the total cross sectional area of the charge ports to the total cross sectional area of the discharge ports. As that ratio increases the amount of discharge time may also increase. Simply increasing the volume of the stored gas may not be effective if the total cross sectional discharge area is large.

Large caliber guns may operate with vastly differing propellant charges. A single artillery weapon may use different charge configurations. As a result the bore evacuator may need to function properly over a wide range of charge pressures. Typically the bore evacuator may be significantly over designed to properly function at both low and high charge pressures. Thus bore evacuators may be rather large and heavy devices.

A need exists for a bore evacuator that may be of a small volume while providing effective bore evacuation of the gun.

It is an object of the invention to provide a bore evacuator that may be of a small volume and may provide effective bore evacuation of a gun.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for evacuating a gun tube wherein discharge of gas from the bore evacuator may be delayed beyond the time when the pressure in the gun tube is less than the pressure in the bore evacuator.

One aspect of the invention is a bore evacuator for a gun tube having a bore. The bore evacuator may include a reservoir and at least one intake port between the reservoir and the bore of the gun tube. A one way valve may be disposed in the intake port. The one way valve may allow flow only from the bore of the gun tube to the reservoir. The bore evacuator may include at least one discharge port between the reservoir and the bore of the gun tube. A one way time delayed valve may be disposed in the discharge port. The one way time delayed valve may allow gas flow only from the reservoir to the bore of the gun tube. The one way time delayed valve may open substantially simultaneously as a breech of the gun tube opens.

The time delay of the one way time delayed valve may be activated by gas pressure in the reservoir. The bore evacuator may also include a pressure regulating valve fluidly connected to the reservoir for regulating a maximum pressure in the reservoir.

In another aspect of the invention a bore evacuator for a gun tube may include a three chambered reservoir having a high pressure chamber a low pressure chamber and a discharge plenum. At least one intake port may be disposed between the high pressure chamber and the bore of the gun tube. The bore evacuator may include a one way valve that only allows gas flow from the high pressure chamber to the low pressure chamber. At least one discharge port may be disposed between the discharge plenum and the bore of the gun tube. The bore evacuator may include a one way time delayed valve that only allows gas flow from the low pressure chamber to the discharge plenum. The one way time delayed valve may open substantially simultaneously as a breech of the gun tube opens.

A further aspect of the invention is a method. The method may include providing a bore evacuator having a time delayed discharge valve for a gun tube. The time delayed discharge valve may be opened substantially simultaneously with opening a breech of the gun tube. The method may include activating a time delay of the time delayed discharge valve with gas pressure in the bore evacuator.

Before opening the time delayed discharge valve the method may include regulating a maximum pressure in the bore evacuator. After opening the time delayed discharge valve the method may include evacuating the gun tube using gas from the bore evacuator.

The method may also include drawing fresh air into the breech of the gun tube via ejector flow action created by gas flow from the bore evacuator.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

At least one discharge port may be provided between reservoir and bore of gun tube . Discharge port s may be angled toward a muzzle end of gun tube . In that way gas flow from port s may entrain gas in bore and may exit the muzzle end of the gun tube . A one way time delayed valve may be disposed in each discharge port . One way time delayed valve may allow gas flow only from reservoir to bore of gun tube . A plurality of discharge ports and respective valves may be used. By way of example only discharge ports may have diameters of about 4.5 mm.

 Time delayed refers to the time difference between when a conventional bore evacuator begins discharging gas into the bore of a gun tube and when the inventive bore evacuator begins discharging gas into a gun tube. In a conventional bore evacuator discharge from the bore evacuator may begin when the pressure in the bore drops below the pressure in the bore evacuator. In the inventive bore evacuator discharge from the bore evacuator may begin some time after the pressure in the bore drops below the pressure in the bore evacuator.

In one embodiment bore evacuator may begin discharging gas into the bore when a breech of gun tube is opened. In this embodiment one way time delayed valve may open substantially simultaneously with the opening of breech of gun tube . Substantially simultaneously means the two events may be within a range of about 0 to about 300 milliseconds of each other.

Breech may open when gun tube returns to battery. The recoil of gun tube may activate the opening of breech in a known manner. In some embodiments one way time delayed valve may receive a signal to open from a sensor not shown that may sense when breech opens. In other embodiments time delayed valve may be a mechanical time delay apparatus such as for example the adjustable time delay apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 416 030 issued on Aug. 26 2008 to Lupien et al. The entire content of U.S. Pat. No. 7 416 030 is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

If one way time delayed valve is a mechanical time delay apparatus its time delay may be activated the time delay period begins by gas pressure in reservoir . In one embodiment the time delay of one way valve may be for example about 500 milliseconds. The time delay may be adjusted to coincide with the opening of breech .

Bore evacuator may include a pressure regulating valve . Pressure regulating valve may be fluidly connected to reservoir . Pressure regulating valve may regulate the maximum pressure in reservoir . Pressure regulating valve may relieve excess pressure in reservoir by bleeding gas to the ambient environment. By way of example only the maximum pressure in reservoir may be about 100 200 psi.

In general the volume of reservoir may be much less than that of conventional bore evacuators. The volume of reservoir may depend on the caliber of gun tube and the type of ammunition or rounds being fired in tube . In one embodiment the volume of reservoir may be in a range of about 300 cubic inches to about 700 cubic inches. Conventional reservoirs by contrast may be four or five times as large as reservoir .

When a round is fired in gun tube reservoir may be filled with propellant gases through intake port s and one way intake valve s . When the gas pressure in reservoir becomes higher than the gas pressure in bore one way valve s may close thereby trapping the gas in reservoir . Reservoir may store the propellant gases until breech opens.

As pressure rises in reservoir the maximum pressure in reservoir may be limited by pressure regulating valve . Valve may communicate between reservoir and the outside atmosphere. As pressure in reservoir begins to rise the time delay mechanism in one way time delayed discharge valve may be activated. After approximately 500 milliseconds for example one way time delayed discharge valve may open thereby porting gases from reservoir to discharge port s . Ports may communicate directly with bore . At substantially the same time as one way time delay valve opens breech may open. The gas from discharge ports may then entrain flow through bore and draw fresh air into the bore . Most of the propellant gases from bore may then be evacuated.

One or more intake ports may be provided between high pressure chamber and bore of gun tube . One or more one way valves may be disposed between high pressure chamber and low pressure chamber . One way valves may only allow gas flow from high pressure chamber to low pressure chamber . One or more discharge ports may be provided between discharge plenum and bore of gun tube .

One or more one way time delayed valves may be disposed between low pressure chamber and discharge plenum . One way time delayed valves may only allow gas flow from low pressure chamber to discharge plenum . One way time delayed valves may open substantially simultaneously with the opening of breech of gun tube .

One way time delayed valves may operate similar to one way time delay valves of the embodiment of . That is operation of valves may be controlled by a breech open sensor or valves may be mechanically time delayed. The time delay of one way time delayed valves may be activated by gas pressure in low pressure chamber . In one embodiment the time delay of one way valves may be about 500 milliseconds.

Bore evacuator may include a pressure regulating valve . Pressure regulating valve may be fluidly connected to low pressure chamber . Pressure regulating valve may regulate the maximum pressure in low pressure chamber . Pressure regulating valve may relieve excess pressure in chamber by bleeding gas to the ambient environment of gun tube .

In general the volume of reservoir may be much less than that of conventional bore evacuators. The volume of reservoir may depend on the caliber of gun tube and the type of ammunition or rounds being fired in tube . In one embodiment the volume of reservoir may be in a range of about 300 cubic inches to about 700 cubic inches for a typical large caliber direct fire weapon. Conventional reservoirs by contrast may be four or five times as large as reservoir .

The volume of low pressure chamber may be at least as large as the sum of the volumes of high pressure chamber and discharge plenum . In one embodiment low pressure chamber may be about 80 of the volume of reservoir and each of high pressure chamber and discharge plenum may be about 10 of the volume of reservoir .

An advantage of a multi chambered reservoir such as reservoir may be that the valves and are not directly exposed to the harsh environment of bore . The harsh environment of bore may include high temperatures high pressures and erosive gases. So valves and may be less costly to manufacture.

In bore evacuator high pressure chamber may be filled with propellant gas through ports . High pressure chamber may communicate with larger low pressure chamber through one way charge check valve s . One way time delay valves may be disposed between low pressure chamber and discharge plenum . Discharge plenum may include discharge ports . After about a 500 millisecond time delay valves may open and communicate flow between low pressure chamber and discharge plenum . The flow may then exit discharge plenum and enter bore through discharge port s .

Bore evacuators and may use substantially smaller volumes of gas at lower pressures than conventional bore evacuators. Thus the overall volume of evacuators and may be less than conventional bore evacuators. Also the lower pressures of evacuators and may reduce the required wall thickness of reservoirs and .

As can be seen in the discharge of the time delayed evacuator may be delayed by about 500 milliseconds compared to the conventional bore evacuator. For both the high and low pressure ammunition the initial pressure of the time delayed evacuator at the time the breech of the gun opens around 500 700 milliseconds is significantly higher than the initial pressure of the conventional evacuator. The higher pressure may improve ejector performance. Also the time delayed evacuator may provide more than one full tube of air exchange for both ammunition types while the conventional evacuator may do so for only the high pressure ammunition. Because the pressure regulator limits the maximum pressure for the high pressure ammunition and the low pressure ammunition both the high pressure ammunition and the low pressure ammunition may have similar bore evacuation performance. The combination of the pressure regulator and the time delay mechanism may provide a consistently high initial pressure when the breech opens.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
