This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011 09 3 0002 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Raman spectroscopy has been utilized for a number of years to identify single molecules from various types of samples. Raman spectroscopy more particularly has been utilized to identify the vibrational modes of molecules to distinguish between different molecular species. The probability however of a Raman interaction occurring between an excitatory beam of light and an individual molecule in a sample is very low for instance 10cmfor CN. As such the use of Raman spectroscopy to identify individual molecules has been relatively limited.

One approach to enhancing the Raman spectroscopy effect is to place the molecules near roughened silver surfaces. The surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS effect is related to the phenomenon of plasmon resonance in which metal nanoparticles exhibit an increased optical resonance in response to incident electromagnetic radiation due to the collective coupling of conduction electrons in the metal. Attempts at implementing SERS have included coating metal nanoparticles or fabricating rough metal films on the surface of the substrate and then applying a sample to the metal coated surface.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the embodiments are described by referring mainly to examples thereof. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances well known methods and structures are not described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the description of the embodiments.

Disclosed herein is an apparatus for detecting at least one species in a sample using multi wavelength Raman light detection which results in a relatively high level of precision. The accuracy of the species detection is relatively high because the apparatus disclosed herein significantly increases the signal to noise ratio in the processing of the Raman light emissions from the species. As discussed in greater detail herein below a spatial relationship between light beams having different wavelengths and the sample is modulated at an identified frequency to cause the sample to be irradiated by light beams having different wavelengths. In addition a post signal processing unit is configured to process the detected Raman light emitted from the species at the identified frequency. In one regard the post signal processing unit or a computing device is configured to lock into the identified frequency and to filter out signals in other frequencies when processing the detected Raman light which results in the increased signal to noise ratio.

With reference first to there is shown a simplified schematic diagram of an apparatus for detecting at least one species in a sample using multi wavelength Raman light detection according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the apparatus depicted in may include additional components and that some of the components described herein may be removed and or modified without departing from a scope of the apparatus . It should also be understood that the components depicted in are not drawn to scale and thus the components may have different relative sizes with respect to each other than as shown therein.

As shown the apparatus includes at least one laser source configured to emit one or more laser beams . In one example the apparatus includes a single laser source configured to emit a single laser beam . In this example the single laser source includes an optical element not shown such as a prism or other optical element configured to split the laser beam into a plurality of light beams . In another example the apparatus includes a plurality of laser sources in which each of the plurality of laser sources is configured to emit one of a plurality of light beams at different wavelengths. The plurality of different wavelengths may range between for instance wavelengths of around 400 600 nm. In any of the examples discussed above a plurality of light beams having different wavelengths with respect to each other illuminate a sample for instance contained in a channel as discussed in greater detail herein below. The sample may however be contained on a substrate or other container without departing from a scope of the invention.

The light beams are depicted as being transmitted through a waveguide such as an optical fiber prior to irradiating the sample . Although not explicitly shown the light beams may traverse an optical path containing one or more optical devices configured to manipulate for instance the placements directions intensities etc. of the light beams . These optical devices may include for instance an electro optic deflector prism mirrors etc.

In one embodiment the sample generally comprises a fluid material configured to flow through the channel as indicted by the arrows . The sample may be contained in a reservoir not shown and forced through the channel through operation of a pump . In addition the channel may comprise a nanometer to micrometer width.

As further shown in the light beams are configured to illuminate one or more species contained in the sample and to cause a Raman effect on the species and thereby cause Raman light to be emitted or scattered from the species . The species may comprise a molecule a biological particle a cell etc. The Raman light emitted from the species is collected by one or more optical elements which may include for instance a condenser lens system a spectrometer a filter etc. For instance the emitted Raman light is focused by the condenser lens system and undergoes wavelength dispersion in the spectrometer prior to reaching one or more optical detectors to for instance convert the emitted Raman light to a monochromated light. The optical detector s receives the emitted Raman light and converts it to an electrical output signal which is transmitted to a post signal processing unit . Although not shown the electrical output signal may be amplified prior to or during transmission to the post signal processing unit .

The components of the apparatus may be arranged in any suitable manner. For instance the optical elements and the detector s may be arranged on the same side of the species as the laser beams . In another example the channel may be supported on a transparent substrate not shown such as glass and the optical elements and the detector s may be arranged to capture Raman light that is emitted through the channel .

Also depicted in is a modulating element for modulating a spatial relationship between the sample and the light beams to cause relative positions of the sample and the light beams to be oscillated. The modulating element is configured to modulate the spatial relationship in any of a plurality of different manners as discussed in greater detail below with respect to alternatives . By way of example the modulating element is configured to cause the channel to oscillate across the light beams which have different wavelengths with respect to each other such that the sample is sequentially illuminated by the different light beams . As another example the modulating element is configured to cause the light beams to oscillate across the channel to sequentially illuminate the sample with the different light beams . These examples are discussed in greater detail herein below with respect to . As a further example the modulating element is configured to cause the sample to oscillate within the channel to thereby cause portions of the sample to be sequentially illuminated by the different light beams . This example is discussed in greater detail herein below with respect to .

In any of the examples above the modulating element may be configured to modulate the spatial relationship between the sample and the light beams at an identified frequency to cause the Raman light to be emitted from the species at the identified frequency. In one example the amplitude of the modulation is selected to enable the sample to be irradiated by each of the light beams during each modulation cycle or oscillation cycle. Each modulation cycle may comprise a complete displacement of the sample across each of the light beams .

In one regard the post signal processing unit is configured to implement a lock in detection technique on the Raman light emission s detected by the optical elements s while the species is irradiated by each of the different light beams . As such for instance the post signal processing unit includes a lock in amplifier a boxcar amplifier a combination of a lock in amplifier and a boxcar amplifier or the like which serves to detect and amplify only the signal component of the electrical output signal from the detector s that has the same frequency as that of the identified frequency at which the modulating element modulates either or both of the sample and the light beams . More particularly for instance the post signal processing unit may implement a high speed or a programmable monochromater or a multi wavelength filter to differentiate the Raman signal at each wavelength and thus the post signal processing unit may employ a similar processing techniques as those employed in processing single wavelength detection. Because the post signal processing unit detects and amplifies only the signal component of the electrical output signal that has the same frequency as that of the identified frequency of a reference signal received from the modulating element the input signal component having a frequency different from that of the reference signal is not sampled. Further by selecting appropriately the locked in phase the post signal processing unit may sample the signal component ascribable to a particular species .

In another regard the post signal processing unit is configured to output data pertaining to the results of the post signal processing on the detected Raman light emissions . As shown in the post signal processing unit is configured to output the data through an output device which may comprise for instance a display a printer a computing device etc. through which the results such as whether a species has been detected may be outputted.

With reference now to there is shown a simplified and enlarged schematic diagram of the channel the sample and the light beams depicted in according to an embodiment. The diagram generally depicts the light beams as being composed of a plurality of light beams having different wavelengths and arranged as relatively distinct bands. By way of example the light beam A may comprise a wavelength of light that appears dark blue the light beam B may comprise a wavelength of light that appears blue the light beam C may comprise a wavelength of light that appears green the light beam D may comprise a wavelength of light that appears yellow the light beam E may comprise a wavelength of light that appears orange and the light beam F may comprise a wavelength of light that appears red. Although the light beams have been depicted as being arranged in a particular order the light beams may be arranged in any order with respect to each other. In addition the light beams may include less than six different light beams . For instance the light beams may be composed of two or more of the light beams . Moreover although the bands of light beams have been depicted as being in close proximity to each other gaps may exist between adjacent light beams without departing from a scope of the invention.

In a first example which corresponds to alternative A in the modulating element is configured to modulate the light beams with respect to the sample as indicated by the arrow . In this example the modulating element is configured to cause the light beams to oscillate across the sample such that the sample is irradiated by each of the light beams during each modulation cycle. The modulating element may cause the light beams to oscillate across the sample in any of a variety of different manners. For instance the modulating element may modulate the spatial positions of the one or more laser sources . As another example the laser beam s emitted by the laser source s may be deflected by an electro optic deflector not shown prior to irradiating the sample . In this example the modulating element is configured to modulate the electro optic deflector to modulate the deflection of the laser beam s and thereby cause the light beams to oscillate across the sample .

In a second example which corresponds to alternative B in the modulating element is configured to modulate at least one of the spatial position and angle of the optical waveguide to thereby modulate the illumination positions of the light beams with respect to the sample . In a third example which corresponds to alternative C in the modulating element is configured to modulate the spatial position of the channel with respect to the light beams . In this example the modulating element is configured to cause the channel to oscillate between the light beams to thereby cause the sample to be irradiated by each of the light beams during each modulation cycle.

In the first second and third alternatives the modulating element may comprise any suitable mechanical device configured to modulate one or more of the laser source s the optical waveguide and the channel . Examples of suitable mechanical devices include MEMS devices piezoelectric devices a voice coil etc.

In a fourth example which corresponds to alternative D in the modulating element is configured to modulate the position of the sample with respect to the light beams . This example is depicted in which shows a simplified and enlarged schematic diagram of the channel the sample and the light beams depicted in according to another example. The diagram in is similar to the diagram in except that the light beams are rotated approximately 90 degrees. In addition the modulating element comprises a pump configured to modulate the position of the sample as indicated by the arrow . In this example the pump is configured to cause the at least a portion of the sample to oscillate across the light beams within the channel .

In each of the examples discussed above when the sample is irradiated by the light beams one or more of the species contained in the sample may substantially be held in place by an optical tweezing effect on the species applied by the light beams . In this regard the species may substantially be held in place during multiple modulation cycles . In addition the species are configured to emit Raman light and the intensities of the Raman light emissions from the species may differ depending upon the wavelengths of the light beams . According to an embodiment the detector s are configured to detect the Raman light emissions and the post signal processing unit is configured to track the Raman light emissions as the relative spatial positions between the sample and the light beams oscillate. An example of the detected Raman light emission intensities at various times as the relative spatial positions are oscillated in modulation cycles is depicted in .

According to an embodiment a species may be determined to have been relatively accurately detected in the event that for instance the ratios of the Raman light intensities for the different excitation wavelengths during multiple modulation cycles and are substantially equivalent to each other. Otherwise in instances where the ratios of the Raman light intensities for the different excitation wavelengths are not substantially equivalent to each other a determination that a species has not been accurately detected may be made. The post signal processing unit may for instance include appropriate logic to analyze the Raman light intensity ratios to make the determinations discussed above.

According to another embodiment the apparatus is implemented to concurrently detect multiple species as the spatial relationship between the sample and the light beams is modulated. In this embodiment the post signal processing unit or other processing device such as a computer device may parallel process the Raman light emissions received from multiple species .

With reference back to and according to an embodiment the one or more detectors comprise at least one wide area detector configured to detect the Raman light emissions at multiple displacements. In addition or alternatively and with particular reference to there is shown a simplified and enlarged diagram of the detector s formed of an array of detectors according to an embodiment. The array of detectors may be formed of a plurality of detectors in which each of the detectors is configured to detect light received from a different location with respect to the channel . Also shown therein is a diffraction grating which splits and diffracts the Raman light emissions into several beams that travel into different directions and onto the deflectors of the detector array . Moreover the detectors in the detector array are configured to send electrical output signals to the post signal processing unit as discussed above with respect to the detector s in .

Turning now to there is shown a simplified and enlarged diagram of the detector s formed of an array of detectors according to another embodiment. As shown therein instead of being diffracted by a single diffraction grating as in the diagram in the diagram the Raman light emissions are diffracted by multiple diffraction gratings prior to reaching the detector array . The multiple diffraction gratings generally operate to increase the spacing between the Raman light emissions to thus enable relatively larger detectors in the detector array to be implemented in detecting the Raman light emissions from multiple locations on the substrate . The detectors in the detector array are also depicted as being configured to send electrical output signals to the post signal processing unit as discussed above with respect to the detector s in .

Turning now to there is shown a flow diagram of a method for detecting at least one species contained in a sample through multi wavelength Raman light detection according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the method depicted in may include additional steps and that some of the steps described herein may be removed and or modified without departing from a scope of the method .

At step the sample is illuminated with light beams having different wavelengths in which the light beams are at least partially separated from each other as shown for instance in . The light beams may illuminate the sample in any of the manners discussed above with respect to the apparatus .

At step a spatial relationship between the sample and the light beams is modulated to cause relative positions of the sample and the light beams to be oscillated for instance at an identified frequency of oscillation. The spatial relationship may be modulated in any of the manners discussed above with respect to the modulating element . In addition as the spatial relationship is modulated the sample is configured to be illuminated with excitation light of different wavelengths . Moreover Raman light is configured to be emitted or scattered from at least one species contained in the sample as the sample receives the excitation light at the different wavelengths .

At step the Raman light emitted from the at least one species is detected through operation of for instance the optical element s and the detector s . As discussed above the detector s may comprise an array of detectors configured to detect Raman light emitted from species located in multiple locations on the substrate .

At step the detected Raman light emission s are processed at the identified frequency to detect the species . More particularly for instance a lock in detection technique may be implemented on the detected Raman light emission s at the identified frequency of oscillation to thus enable the post signal processing unit to sample only the signal component ascribable to the species .
