This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 260 381 filed on Nov. 11 2009. The disclosure of the prior application is considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.

Telecommunications is becoming increasingly important in today s society. Telecommunications systems allow users located at great distances to communicate with one another. A conventional telephone call requires a connection between the devices e.g. land or mobile telephones used by the caller and the called party. Such connections were traditionally formed by creating a physical connection by physically closing a plurality of switches to complete a circuit between the two telephones. Physical switches have been replaced with computer software and other softswitch technology. Softswitches can be used to perform the necessary switching of calls through a network thereby eliminating the need for certain hardware and reducing the cost associated with establishing calls between individuals.

Systems methods and computer program products for managing a call are described. In some implementations an intelligent softswitch can be used to communicate with a provider system that can relay or switch one or more outbound calls initiated by a caller and intended for a subscriber to the intelligent softswitch. Upon receiving the relayed call the intelligent softswitch can process the relayed call using one or more call handling rules that have been specified by the subscriber. After processing the relayed call is routed back to the provider system for completing the call.

In some implementations a method can be used that includes receiving a relayed call from a provider system including call information associated with the call identifying a subscriber based on the call information identifying one or more configuration parameters associated with the subscriber and processing the relayed call based on the one or more identified configuration parameters including routing the relayed call back to the provider system for completing the relayed call.

In some implementations a system can be used that includes a database for storing one or more configuration profiles and a call control manager for receiving a relayed call from a provider system the call control manager including a softswitch operable to identify call information associated with the relayed call identify a subscriber based on the call information identify a configuration profile associated with the subscriber process the relayed call in accordance with the configuration profile and route the relayed call back to the provider system for completing the relayed call.

In some implementations a device can be used that includes a softswitch operable to receive a relayed call from a third party device identify call information associated with the relayed call identify a subscriber based on the call information identify a configuration profile associated with the subscriber process the relayed call in accordance with the configuration profile and route the relayed call back to the third party device for completing the relayed call.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the techniques will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

The intelligent softswitch can be configured to communicate with one or more communication devices using one or more modes of communication. Examples of such modes of communication can include without limitation public branch exchange PBX public switched telephone network PSTN phone technologies cellular wireless telephone technologies standards such as global system for mobile communications GSM frequency division multiple access FDMA time division multiple access TDMA code division multiple access CDMA other communications protocols such as session initiation protocol SIP and the like.

The intelligent softswitch in some implementations can communicate with a provider system that can relay or switch one or more outbound calls initiated by a caller and intended for the subscriber to the intelligent softswitch e.g. via link . The caller can initiate a call request to place the call using for example a communications device e.g. a mobile device and the communications device can be configured to interact with the provider system over a communications network e.g. a telecom network . The communications device also can include an interface for facilitating generation receipt processing and management of call control data for delivery over the communications network . Where the communications device used by the caller includes an interface the interface can be configured to implement various functionalities including displaying outbound calls dialing outbound calls and other functionalities.

As shown in calls or call requests originating from the caller can first be relayed to the provider system over the network . Depending on the type of the communications device used by the caller the network used to facilitate the connection of the call of the caller can be different. For example where the caller places a call to the subscriber using an analog phone the network can be a PSTN connected to the provider system and or other interconnected switches e.g. third party switches external switches and the like . Where an analog phone is used to place the call by the caller the provider system can provide the necessary conversion e.g. converting between analog data used by the analog phone and digital data used internally by the provider system that is suitable for processing by the intelligent softswitch or receipt by the subscriber at any one of the communications devices or the user terminal .

An outbound call from the caller can be received by the provider system which can detect the dialed number and establish the call and can be relayed along with the dialed number or any other called information associated with the call or the caller to the intelligent softswitch . The dialed number can be served by the provider system and assigned to a receiving device associated with the subscriber .

In some implementations the intelligent softswitch can be formed as part of a call manager in a virtual PBX system and the provider system can be connected to the call manager to which calls intended for the subscriber are relayed. In some implementations the call manager can provide for example switching signaling analog to digital conversion functions or other functions for facilitating calls intended for the subscriber from various types of devices.

Although not shown the intelligent softswitch also can be coupled to one or more wireless base stations utilizing GSM W CDMA W TDMA and or G GPRS technology. Also while only one intelligent softswitch is shown more than one intelligent softswitch also is contemplated.

In general the intelligent softswitch can provide core call processing and routing for the telecommunication network . The intelligent softswitch can process multiple types of calls including calls originating from or terminating at off network or on network devices. The intelligent softswitch also can receive messages e.g. SMS or MMS messages from and send messages to various callers and subscribers.

The intelligent softswitch can be configured to permit switching of outbound calls placed by the caller . For example the intelligent softswitch can receive an outbound call from the caller e.g. via the provider system and dynamically process and switch the outbound call based on one or more existing forwarding rules specified by the subscriber as will be discussed in greater detail below . As an example the intelligent softswitch can forward the outbound call to one or more of the communications devices associated with the subscriber through the PSTN e.g. to a PSTN communications device the internet protocol IP network e.g. to an IP communications device or the cellular phone network e.g. to a mobile device . As yet another example calls which either originate off network or terminate off network can be carried over the PSTN to the PSTN communications device . Similarly calls which both originate on network and terminate on network can be carried over the IP network or to the user terminal .

In addition to the communications devices the intelligent softswitch also can provide switching and other services to SIP H.323 devices media gateways base stations and other network devices. Such services can include but are not limited to phone to phone phone to PC fax to e mail e mail to fax fax to fax call center applications VPN IP phone and the like. The intelligent softswitch can convert various media e.g. voice video audio fax and the like provided in one type of network to a format suitable for another type of network. The intelligent softswitch also can facilitate calls originated from one type of network to a same or different type of network. For example the intelligent softswitch can terminate bearer channels from a switched circuit network e.g. signaling system 7 SS7 and allow SIP H.323 devices to place calls to or receive calls from other SIP H.323 devices via the intelligent softswitch . As another example SIP H.323 devices can place calls to or receive calls from devices connected to the PSTN using the intelligent softswitch . As yet another example SIP H.323 devices can place calls to or receive calls from wireless phones e.g. mobile device through the cellular phone network and other wireless access terminals using the intelligent softswitch .

In general the intelligent softswitch can provide an integrated software and hardware solution that accommodates the relay of calls from any of a number of types of networks and forward the calls across a same or different network to any of a number of different destinations or devices specified by the subscriber . The intelligent softswitch can in essence bridge the disparity technologies between for example packet based networks traditional PSTN communications and wireless networks to advance lower cost and high revenue value added services.

To establish a phone call the caller can enter instructions by way of a caller device. Depending on the nature of the call telephone or data the instructions can include for example a specific telephone number electronic mail address a sequence of codes or any other information associated with transmission of the call to the subscriber . After completing the dialing instructions the caller by way of the caller device can relay the outbound call containing the instructions to the provider system which can then relay the outbound call to either the intelligent softswitch or transmit the outbound call directly to a receiving device of the subscriber . The receiving device of the subscriber can be a mobile telephone a landline telephone a computer terminal or any other communications device.

Where the outbound call is relayed to the intelligent softswitch for processing the intelligent softswitch can parse the instructions contained in the outbound call to determine the destination address and any other codes needed for connecting the call to the subscriber . Based on the information contained in the parsed instructions the intelligent softswitch can select for example a receiving device or a device with a pre specified forwarding number to which the outbound call is routed. Using Voice over IP protocol as an example the intelligent softswitch can determine and provide a destination address e.g. the IP communications device of the subscriber and an origination address e.g. the caller s telephone number an electronic mail address associated with the telephone number an Internet Protocol address or other information identifying the origin of the outbound call to an IP gateway associated with the IP communications device of the subscriber . The intelligent softswitch can communicate with the Internet gateway to prepare for relaying the outbound call along with call information associated with the call e.g. caller ID . After identifying the Internet gateway address the intelligent softswitch can create a link e.g. a secure link with the Internet gateway to set up the connection for the call. After establishing the softswitch to gateway connection the caller can be connected to the subscriber using for example conventional VoIP techniques to facilitate the call between the caller and the subscriber . Once the outbound call is connected the intelligent softswitch also can transfer the call control to an application programming interface API associated with the IP communications device of the subscriber to handle the remaining call processing and termination.

As an alternative to relaying the outbound call directly to the subscriber the provider system can first relay the outbound call to the intelligent softswitch which then can direct the outbound call to the subscriber s voicemail inbox and store recorded message associated with the outbound call on either the receiving device of the subscriber and or in the database that allows the recorded messages to be simultaneously reviewed by the subscriber .

In some implementations upon receiving the relayed call from the provider system the intelligent softswitch can execute one or more instructions to determine whether the intended recipient of the relayed call is a recognized subscriber. For example the intelligent softswitch can first identify the called number associated with the outbound call. If the called number is associated with the subscriber the intelligent softswitch can be configured to forward the outbound call along with any identifiable and recognizable call identification information e.g. caller ID of the caller directly to the subscriber either through the provider system or to one of the communications devices e.g. to either the user terminal or one of the communications devices specified by the subscriber . The intelligent softswitch also can be programmed to automatically forward calls with unrecognizable caller IDs to the voice mailbox of the subscriber .

In some implementations the intelligent softswitch in conjunction with the control manager can execute one or more instructions associated with determining the identity of the caller for facilitating the means by which the identity of a caller is to be specified. For example a caller with a blocked caller ID may be required to specify the name of the caller before the call can be switched. As another example blocked calls can be answered on the first ring and an announcement or greeting can be played to notify the caller that blocked calls are not accepted and can only be switched once the caller has revealed the caller s identity.

In some implementations if the intelligent softswitch does not recognize the caller ID of the relayed call or that the number from which the outbound call is made is not one of the numbers authorized by the subscriber the relayed call can be forwarded to the voice mailbox of the subscriber .

While the intelligent softswitch is described in relation to processing outbound calls the intelligent softswitch also can be configured to receive and process data or messages that can subsequently be routed to the subscriber . For example the intelligent softswitch can be configured to receive a message from the provider and convert the message into one or more data communication messages if necessary e.g. where the format of the message as originally received is incompatible for an IP network .

As an example the intelligent softswitch can be configured to convert the message into a SIP message e.g. in the form of an individual IP data packet that can be sent or received over an IP network. SIP is an application layer signaling protocol that can be used in for example VoIP applications. In particular SIP is a peer to peer protocol developed for initiating modifying and terminating an interactive user session on an IP network. Devices connected to the IP network e.g. communications device can communicate directly with one another using SIP. However other protocols such as ITU H.323 also can be used in addition to or in lieu of SIP for communication between the intelligent softswitch and other IP network components and devices. Also SIP messages can be used to identify the subscriber and can designate the type of connection requested e.g. incoming call outgoing call and the like . In addition SIP messages can be used to identify the external called the calling party and or any other information desirable for controlling call handling for the subscriber .

In some implementations the process can be used to direct an outbound call to a subscriber e.g. subscriber through a provider system e.g. provider system and an intelligent softswitch e.g. intelligent softswitch . In some implementations the provider system can relay the call directly to the subscriber. In some implementations the provider system can relay the call along with call information associated with the call to the intelligent softswitch which can receive the relayed call service the relayed call using VoIP techniques and route the relayed call back to the provider system e.g. via link for completing the call at the subscriber . In some implementations links and can be coupled to a same or different network. In some implementations the intelligent softswitch can directly receive an outbound call from the caller or forward the relayed call to the subscriber without needing the call service of the provider system .

In some implementations after receiving and processing the relayed call the intelligent softswitch also can relay the outbound call to one or more predetermined locations. For example where the subscriber has previously specified in a pre provisioned service e.g. the service hosted by a host that is hosting the softswitch that any outbound call is to be relayed based on one or more call forwarding rules set by the subscriber the intelligent softswitch can forward the outbound call according to the one or more call forwarding rules.

Before forwarding the relayed call to the subscriber in some implementations the intelligent softswitch can first identify the subscriber as the recipient of the outbound call and determine the call forwarding profile including any existing call forwarding rule associated with the subscriber . For example the intelligent softswitch can determine whether the subscriber has previously specified one or more forwarding numbers and or locations or the option to ring sequentially or simultaneously at the one or more specified forwarding numbers and or locations. As an example the intelligent softswitch can determine that the subscriber has set up a call profile that identifies a landline number and a softphone with an IP address for receiving outbound calls. Based on the call profile the intelligent softswitch can process the call and re direct the call to either or both the landline number and the softphone at the specified IP address.

Referring to process begins with receiving a call e.g. an outbound call from a provider system . For example the provider system can first receive the outbound call or a call request from the caller and service and relay the outbound call or call request to the intelligent softswitch e.g. using a provider switch of the provider system .

In some implementations the intelligent softswitch can receive the relayed call along with call information associated with the relayed call. Call information associated with the relayed call can include without limitation caller name caller phone number caller address date of call time of call city state of origin at time of the call other caller and contact related information or any combination thereof.

In some implementations the outbound call can be established by the caller using a mobile device. The mobile device can be a portable communications unit such as without limitation a hand held cellular phone a communication unit installed in a vehicle or a fixed location communications unit e.g. a landline phone or a softphone initiated through a user terminal . To establish an outbound call the mobile device can for example establish the call over the network e.g. a wired or wireless network . As an example the network can include a cellular network and can communicate with a wide area network WAN through a gateway. In some implementations both voice and data communications originated from the caller can be established over the network . For example the caller can use the mobile device to place and receive phone calls e.g. using VoIP protocols send and receive e mail messages e.g. using POP3 protocol and retrieve electronic documents and or streams such as web pages photographs and videos over the wireless network gateway and wide area network e.g. using TCP IP or UDP protocols .

As one example the process will be explained with respect to the caller making the outbound call using a mobile device. However other communications devices also can be used which can include without limitation VoIP phones landline or wireless phones or any type of communications devices suitable for originating receiving and participating in communications with other communication devices with the provider system and or the intelligent softswitch . For example the device used by the caller can be any one of a wired POTS phone including a cordless phone a wireless phone e.g. a cellular phone or other mobile communication device including a telephony enabled personal digital assistant PDA a VoIP phone a POTS phone equipped with an analog terminal adapter ATA a soft phone e.g. a computer terminal equipped with telephony software or a telephony enabled video unit e.g. a set top box connected to a television and a remote control . Further calls made by the calling device of the caller can be a voice call a video call a multimedia call or any other type of call.

As discussed above the provider system can receive the outbound call from the caller . In some implementations the provider system which can be a phone carrier can include or be coupled to a base transceiver system and a base station controller to receive and process the outbound call. The base station controller can provide control and management of the outbound call and relay the outbound call to the subscriber using for example a circuit switched core network CSCN that provides traditional voice communications and or packet switched core network PSCN that provides Internet applications and multimedia services e.g. through the intelligent softswitch . The provider system also can include or be in communication with a mobile switching center MSC to provide call switching for traditional voice communications to and from the mobile device used by the caller and can store configuration information to support these capabilities. The MSC can be connected to a base station as well as other public networks such as for example a PSTN or an integrated services digital network ISDN .

In some implementations the nature of the networks and and the switching routing scheme employed by the provider system can depend on the nature of the calling device used by the caller and the way in which the call is made. For example if the caller uses a VoIP phone or a POTS phone equipped with an ATA to establish a VoIP call to the subscriber the network can be a data network and the VoIP call can be transmitted to the provider system through this data network. In this example the networks and can include a digital communications link e.g. Ethernet and the provider system can function as a router to route the call to the subscriber .

Returning to the process shown in a subscriber based on the call information can be identified . For example the provider system can identify and forward the call along with call information associated with the call to the intelligent softswitch and based on the call information the intelligent softswitch can identify the called party as the subscriber .

In some implementations in addition to receiving and transmitting calls from and to the provider system the intelligent softswitch can receive and transmit calls from and to one or more telecommunications networks. Such telecommunications networks can include for example a signaling system 7 SS7 network a PBX network a SIP network or a VoIP network. In this example the intelligent softswitch can transmit or receive calls from ISDN phones connected to the PBX network. As another example the intelligent softswitch can transmit or receive calls from SIP phones connected to the SIP network where an SIP proxy also can be used to serve as an intermediary between SIP network and the SIP phones . The SIP network can include a media gateway to support transmission of the actual voice or data signal between the SIP network and the intelligent softswitch . The intelligent softswitch can communicate with the IP communications device or any softphone using SIP messaging to establish communication sessions through the IP network so as to accommodate VoIP phone calls between the intelligent softswitch and the IP communications device or softphone using IP data packets.

In sum when the caller initiates a call request to place an outbound call the provider system can receive the call request and determine the identifier of the destination e.g. the subscriber s telephone number as well as the identifier of the calling device e.g. the telephone number through which the call originates from the call request. The intelligent softswitch coupled to the provider system can include switching functionalities operable to examine the identifier of the destination and to determine e.g. by accessing the database the corresponding party being called. For example based on the caller identification the intelligent softswitch can determine that the subscriber is the intended recipient of the call.

One or more configuration parameters associated with the subscriber can be identified . In some implementations the one or more configuration parameters can be associated with one or more calling handling rules configured to aid in processing the call. For example the intelligent softswitch can interact with the provider system and the database in order to effect various call processing operations upon receiving an incoming call or when originating an outgoing call or otherwise participating in a call in progress.

Based on the one or more identified configuration parameters the call can be processed . In some implementations where one or more call handling rules have been specified the intelligent softswitch can process an outgoing call intended for the subscriber in accordance with the one or more calling handling rules. In some implementations such rules can include but are not limited to rules pertaining to features such as call blocking call forwarding call screening privacy director PD do not disturb DND call waiting call conferencing call holding speed dialing and other rules. Each rule can be defined for example by a condition an operation to be performed if the condition is satisfied for a given call and an operation to be performed if the condition is not satisfied for a given call. For a given rule the condition can be defined in terms of one or more characteristics of the call. Examples of characteristics of a call can include without limitation the origin e.g. which can be expressed for instance as a telephone number and or other identifier e.g. an IP address or SIP identifier associated with a communication device from which the call originates its intended destination or recipient e.g. which can be expressed for instance as a telephone number and or other identifier e.g. an IP address or SIP identifier associated with a communication device for which the call is destined a time at which it was originated e.g. a date hour minute and the like and other characteristics. For a given rule the calling handling operations to be performed based on whether the condition is satisfied can also depend on the nature of the given rule e.g. route a call to its intended destination forward a call in accordance with a call forwarding rule direct a call to the subscriber s voicemail and the like . The intelligent softswitch can include suitable hardware firmware software control logic or a combination thereof for implementing its call handling functionality.

In some implementations the intelligent softswitch can determine whether one or more forwarding rules have been specified by the subscriber . Where one or more forwarding rules have been specified the intelligent softswitch can further determine if the subscriber has specified a time associated with the one or more forwarding rules. For example the intelligent softswitch can determine whether the subscriber has specified a Business Hours schedule during which calls made during business hours to the subscriber can be forwarded to for example the office number associated with the subscriber . Similarly the intelligent softswitch can determine whether the subscriber has specified a After Hours schedule during which calls made after business hours to the subscriber can be forwarded to for example the home number associated with the subscriber .

As another example if the intelligent softswitch determines that the time of the call is after a particular designated time period the intelligent softswitch can forward the call to for example the IP phone associated with the subscriber . To configure e.g. add delete or modify one or more call handling rules such as call forwarding rules the subscriber can for example access a web based or mobile based interface provided by for example the host hosting network services associated with the intelligent softswitch and subscribed to by the subscriber .

In some implementations each forwarding rule can include one or more types of forwarding numbers such as a forwarding number associated with a mobile device a forwarding number associated with a Home device or a forwarding number associated with an office phone. For example the intelligent softswitch can identify the called number associated with the call placed by the caller as the number associated with the subscriber . With the subscriber being identified as the recipient of the call the intelligent softswitch can determine the one or more forwarding rules associated with the subscriber identify one or more forwarding rules that are active and execute the one or more active forwarding rules in processing the pending call. For example the intelligent softswitch can forward the call to the user terminal to the subscriber e.g. through the provider system to the PSTN communications device coupled to the PSTN e.g. through an underlying carrier coupled to the PSTN to an IP network communications device coupled to the IP network and or to the voicemail associated with the subscriber .

In some implementations the forwarding numbers specified in the forwarding rules can be configured to ring sequentially or simultaneously when the caller places a call to the subscriber . For example the subscriber can establish a call forwarding setting to allow communications devices associated with the call forwarding numbers specified by the subscriber to ring sequentially based on the order in which the call forwarding numbers are listed. As another example the subscriber can establish a call forwarding setting to allow communications devices associated with the call forwarding numbers to ring simultaneously so that the communications devices can be simultaneously rung at the time of receiving an the routed relayed call from the provider system . In sum the mobile device of the subscriber at which the call from the caller is received and the communications devices to which the call is relayed can be configured to ring sequentially or simultaneously. More detail regarding the configuration of call handling rules such as call forwarding rules can be found in for example U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 259 505 filed Nov. 9 2009 entitled CALL MANAGEMENT INTERFACES the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In some implementations after the call has been processed the call can be relayed back to the provider system for completing the call. For example the intelligent softswitch can process the relayed call from the provider system forward the relayed call to one or more communications devices e.g. IP phone and route the relayed call back to the provider system . In some implementations upon receiving the relayed call from the intelligent softswitch the provider system can complete the connection of the outbound call to the subscriber e.g. by connecting the outbound call to the mobile phone or other receiving device associated with the subscriber . By relaying the outbound call initiated by the caller to the intelligent softswitch and routing the relayed call back to the provider system only a single cell phone number or other phone number is needed to forward the call to for example a mobile phone or other receiving device of the subscriber and to the VoIP device associated with the subscriber e.g. a IP phone or user terminal possessing VoIP capability . Thus the subscriber can be reached by the caller at the receiving device or the communications devices with a single phone number.

Operations can be performed in the order listed in parallel e.g. by the same or a different process substantially or otherwise non serially or in reverse order to achieve the same result. In other implementations operations can be performed out of the order shown.

While the process is described with respect to processing an outgoing call from the caller to the subscriber the process also is applicable to placing a call by the subscriber to the caller . Similarly process is applicable to placing a call from one of the communications devices to either the caller or the subscriber .

Further in some implementations the provider system can be omitted. In these implementations the intelligent softswitch can directly receive the outgoing call from the caller through an established link and process the call in accordance with the existing call handling rules.

While the descriptions provided herein pertain to receiving and processing a call it should be appreciated that the subject matter described herein also is applicable to sending and receiving messages e.g. SMS or MMS message multimedia communications and other content. Accordingly although the present description refers to placing a call as used herein the term call also can include telephone calls SMS messages any other form of text messages video messages as well as any other type of telephony action or content transfer that can be initiated by the caller .

Referring to the communications device can include a memory interface one or more data processors image processors and or central processing units and a peripherals interface . The memory interface the one or more processors and or the peripherals interface can be separate components or can be integrated in one or more integrated circuits. The various components in the communications device can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines.

Sensors devices and subsystems can be coupled to the peripherals interface to facilitate multiple functionalities. For example a motion sensor a light sensor and a proximity sensor can be coupled to the peripherals interface to facilitate orientation lighting and proximity functions. Other sensors can also be connected to the peripherals interface such as a positioning system e.g. GPS receiver a temperature sensor a biometric sensor or other sensing device to facilitate related functionalities.

A camera subsystem and an optical sensor e.g. a charged coupled device CCD or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS optical sensor can be utilized to facilitate camera functions such as recording photographs and video clips.

Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wireless communication subsystems which can include radio frequency receivers and transmitters and or optical e.g. infrared receivers and transmitters. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem can depend on the communication network s over which the communications device is intended to operate. For example a communications device can include communication subsystems designed to operate over a GSM network a GPRS network an EDGE network a Wi Fi or WiMax network and a Bluetooth network. In particular the wireless communication subsystem can include hosting protocols such that the communications device can be configured as a base station for other wireless devices.

An audio subsystem can be coupled to a speaker and a microphone to facilitate voice enabled functions such as voice recognition voice replication digital recording and telephony functions.

The I O subsystem can include a touch screen controller and or other input controller s . The touch screen controller can be coupled to a touch screen . The touch screen and touch screen controller can for example detect contact and movement or break thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensitivity technologies including but not limited to capacitive resistive infrared and surface acoustic wave technologies as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with the touch screen .

The other input controller s can be coupled to other input control devices such as one or more buttons rocker switches thumb wheel infrared port USB port and or a pointer device such as a stylus. The one or more buttons not shown can include an up down button for volume control of the speaker and or the microphone .

In some implementations the pressing of a button for a first duration can disengage a lock of the touch screen and the pressing of the same or different button for a second duration that is longer than the first duration can turn power to the communications device on or off. The user can customize a functionality of one or more of the buttons. The touch screen can for example also be used to implement virtual or soft buttons and or a keyboard.

In some implementations the communications device can present recorded audio and or video files such as MP3 AAC and MPEG files. In some implementations the communications device can include the functionality of an MP3 player.

The memory interface can be coupled to memory . The memory can include high speed random access memory and or non volatile memory such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices one or more optical storage devices and or flash memory e.g. NAND NOR . The memory can store an operating system such as Darwin RTXC LINUX UNIX OS X WINDOWS or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks. The operating system can include instructions for handling basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. In some implementations the operating system can be a kernel e.g. UNIX kernel .

The memory can also store communication instructions to facilitate communicating with one or more additional devices one or more computers and or one or more servers. The memory can include graphical user interface instructions to facilitate graphic user interface processing sensor processing instructions to facilitate sensor related processing and functions phone instructions to facilitate phone related processes and functions electronic messaging instructions to facilitate electronic messaging related processes and functions web browsing instructions to facilitate web browsing related processes and functions media processing instructions to facilitate media processing related processes and functions GPS Navigation instructions to facilitate GPS and navigation related processes and instructions camera instructions to facilitate camera related processes and functions and or other software instructions to facilitate other processes and functions e.g. access control management functions as described in reference to . The memory can also store other software instructions not shown such as web video instructions to facilitate web video related processes and functions and or web shopping instructions to facilitate web shopping related processes and functions. In some implementations the media processing instructions are divided into audio processing instructions and video processing instructions to facilitate audio processing related processes and functions and video processing related processes and functions respectively. An activation record and International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI or similar hardware identifier can also be stored in memory .

Each of the above identified instructions and applications can correspond to a set of instructions for performing one or more functions described above. These instructions need not be implemented as separate software programs procedures or modules. The memory can include additional instructions or fewer instructions. Furthermore various functions of the communications device can be implemented in hardware and or in software including in one or more signal processing and or application specific integrated circuits.
