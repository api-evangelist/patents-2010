Synchronization of computer databases is structured into three rounds, namely an agenda round, a query round and a report round. In the agenda round, a synchronization agent software module inquires of a common synchronization engine for updates to the agent's database and provides information as to the level of information in the agent's database. During a query round, a common synchronization engine may request information from databases with new information and distribute that database information to databases needing the new information during a report round. Multiple agents, each representing an associated database may participate a synchronization.

No. 7 139 748 which claims the benefit of Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 377 713 entitled N WAY SYNCHRONIZATION OF COMPUTER DATABASES filed May 2 2002 all assigned to the assignee of the present application. The subject matter in the above identified co pending and commonly owned applications is incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to database design. More particularly embodiments of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for N way synchronization of computer databases.

A database is generally a collection of related information stored in computer readable form. Databases are ubiquitous in modern life. Mobile phones often contain databases of recently and frequently called numbers. The world wide web is comprised of countless databases. Hand held computers are in large part valuable because of the databases they contain. In fact the databases contained in most computers are far more valuable than the computer hardware itself.

In order to use this valuable information people must have access to the information. This is frequently accomplished using different types of computers for different situations. For example a salesman may create a spreadsheet containing pricing information on a desktop computer and desire to access that information via a small hand held computer while at a customer s premises.

It is often difficult expensive or impractical to actually access the same database from both types of computers especially if one is operated in a mobile environment. To overcome this difficulty a process of synchronizing databases was developed.

Synchronizing a database is generally a process by which a plurality of copies of a database is maintained such that the information in all copies is the same or synchronized. The copies need not be bit for bit identical. A synchronization process can accommodate different file structure operating system and data media requirements. The copies are frequently on different computer systems but it is sometimes desirable to maintain separate synchronized databases on the same computer system. Synchronization allows updates mutations e.g. additions deletions and or changes made to one copy of a database for example a copy on a hand held computer to be reflected to all copies.

Prior art synchronization systems use a double headed conduit program to synchronize information. As an unfortunate result such prior art conduit programs must manage all aspects of synchronization data retrieval and data storage between two databases for example on a desktop computer and a hand held computer. Data retrieval and data storage may be particularly difficult in situations involving different types of computers e.g. hand held versus desktop which are running different operating systems e.g. Palm OS versus Microsoft Windows and which store information in different media e.g. byte addressable random access memory versus 512 byte record based rotating magnetic media. In addition a conduit designed to synchronize a database on a hand held computer and for example a PC must manage the communication between the two computers.

It is frequently necessary or desirable to synchronize more than two databases. For example several members of a group may desire to synchronize calendar databases on their hand held computers with a group calendar on a server. Under the prior art using double ended conduit programs the synchronization of more than two databases typically requires multiple synchronization sessions. For example what might be required is a first synchronization session to synchronize databases A and B followed by a second synchronization session to synchronize databases A and C etc. Further in general a separate double ended conduit program would be required for each synchronization to account for any structural differences between for example databases B and C.

As an unfortunate consequence of such limitations of the prior art a general method of synchronizing multiple databases is not available. In addition because prior art conduit programs are constructed to synchronize between two specific databases the introduction of a new type of database typically requires the creation of not just one but an entire set of new conduit programs to synchronize with all of the other types of databases. Such factors strongly discourage the introduction of new databases limiting the art and utility of computer databases

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a method and system for N way synchronization of computer databases. A further need exists for a method of synchronizing information among databases residing on different computers. A still further need exists for a method and system to enable special purpose agents or databases to participate in a synchronization session.

Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for N way synchronization of computer databases. Further embodiments provide a method of synchronizing information among databases residing on different computers. Yet other embodiments provide a method and system to enable special purpose agents and or databases to participate in a synchronization session.

A method and system for N way synchronization of computer databases is disclosed. In one embodiment synchronization of computer databases is structured into three rounds namely an agenda round a query round and a report round. Agents are software modules associated with databases that are used to aid in synchronization. In the agenda round a synchronization agent software module inquires of a common synchronization engine for updates to the agent s database and provides information as to the level of information in the agent s database. During a query round a common synchronization engine may request information from databases with new information and distribute that information to databases needing the new information during a report round. Multiple agents each representing an associated database may participate in a synchronization. In addition various special purpose agents may also receive provide and otherwise operate on synchronization information. In this novel manner multiple databases e.g. N residing on a plurality of computer systems may be synchronized in a structured manner in a single synchronization session.

In another embodiment of the present invention a booster agent augments the capabilities of a database in order to facilitate synchronization of the database.

Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of synchronizing databases between two computers that is optimized for use of a communications channel.

In the following detailed description of the present invention N way synchronization of computer databases numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with equivalents thereof. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow e.g. processes and are presented in terms of procedures steps logic blocks processing and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits that can be performed on computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure computer executed step logic block process etc. is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated in a computer system. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions it is appreciated that throughout the present invention discussions utilizing terms such as indexing or processing or computing or translating or calculating or determining or scrolling or displaying or recognizing or generating or demarking or transferring or synchronizing or accessing or retrieving or conveying or sending or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 000 000 issued on Dec. 7 1999 entitled Extendible Method and Apparatus for Synchronizing Multiple Files on Two Different Computer Systems and assigned to the assignee of the present invention is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of a hand held computer system interacting with a desktop computer. However it is appreciated that the present invention may be utilized in other types of computer systems including embedded and distributed systems where it may be necessary or desirable to synchronize the contents of computer readable information.

Hand held computer system is connected to desktop computer through a communication link . Communication link is often an asynchronous serial data link for example RS 232. However numerous wired and wireless communication links including for example infrared light Bluetooth IEEE 802.11 and universal serial bus USB are well suited to embodiments of the present invention. Communication link allows the two computer systems to transfer information. In the example of hand held computer system is running a calendar or date book application program and the desk top computer system is running a complimentary calendar program . It is desirable for information entered into one program on one computer system for example into calendar program running on hand held computer to be shared with another complimentary calendar program for example calendar program running on desk top computer system .

Synchronization is generally a process by which a plurality of copies of a database are maintained such that the information in all copies is the same or synchronized. The copies need not be bit for bit identical. A synchronization process can accommodate different file structure operating system and data media requirements. The copies are frequently on different computer systems but it is sometimes desirable to maintain separate synchronized databases on the same computer system. Synchronization allows modifications or updates mutations of information for example additions deletions and or changes made to one copy of a database for example a copy on a hand held computer to be reflected to all copies.

These database copies are generally known as endpoints. In some literature the term farpoint is used synonymously. An endpoint is generally a source or destination of records individual data items to be synchronized e.g. a database a communication channel a device etc. For example it is commonplace to synchronize a desktop calendar system database with a calendar database on a hand held computer. In this example the calendar database on the desktop computer is an endpoint and the handheld calendar database is another endpoint. Endpoints are generally data structures in permanent or semi permanent computer memory such as battery powered RAM in a hand held computer or magnetic media within a desktop computer. Endpoints may however be temporary for example a buffer in a wireless data protocol stack.

Synchronization systems including that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 000 000 use a double headed conduit program to synchronize information between two endpoints. A double headed or two ended conduit program manages all aspects of synchronization data retrieval and data storage between two endpoints. In addition two ended conduits are typically constructed to synchronize between two specific endpoints. For example a conduit may synchronize between a contact list phone book database on a hand held computer and a contact list database on a desktop computer. If an application developer desires to synchronize with a third endpoint e.g. synchronize the desktop contact list with an email application on the desktop computer e.g. to share email addresses under the prior art it would be necessary to construct a new and separate conduit to synchronize these two second and third databases endpoints .

Desktop computer system includes a plurality of synchronization sync agents and a hand held synchronization agent endpoints and and common synchronization engine . It is to be appreciated that the terms agent and engine as used herein refer to software modules designed to perform actions and methods described herein.

From the perspective of desktop computer system hand held computer comprises a single endpoint . It is appreciated that data stored in hand held computer may be in a plurality of separate data structures.

According to an embodiment of the present invention each synchronization agent communicates with a single endpoint. It is to be appreciated that a synchronization agent may communicate with other software modules e.g. a common synchronization engine and or a synchronization manager software module which generally do not represent a dataset nor are referred to as endpoints. For example synchronization agent communicates with endpoint which is a contact list database. Likewise hand held synchronization agent communicates with hand held computer as a single endpoint . It is appreciated that a wide variety of physical transport media are well suited to linking desk top computer system with hand held computer according to an embodiment of the present invention. Links may include for example asynchronous serial connections universal serial bus USB ethernet IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth telephone lines and wide area wireless connections e.g. CDPD Mobitext and the like.

To perform a synchronization of data for example contact list data between a contact list database on desk top computer and a phonebook database on hand held computer common synchronization engine is initiated. Common synchronization engine requests information from synchronization agent and hand held synchronization agent . A uniform communication protocol may be used between synchronization engine and the agents. Synchronization agent accesses endpoint that contains contact list data. Hand held synchronization agent accesses hand held computer .

Synchronization agent and hand held synchronization agent provide requested information to common synchronization engine . Generally on a record by record basis common synchronization agent will determine if the data in either endpoint e.g. hand held endpoint or endpoint needs to be updated. If for example the contact information in hand held endpoint has been updated common synchronization engine will send the updates to synchronization agent . Synchronization agent will update the information in endpoint .

It is to be appreciated that synchronization may occur between any two or more synchronization agents and that synchronization does not require hand held computer according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example an e mail application may utilize e mail database . Synchronization agent may participate in the synchronization session described above in order to receive any updates to e mail addresses entered into hand held endpoint or contact list data . Alternatively synchronization agent may participate with synchronization agent in a separate synchronization session and receive updates in this manner.

For example assume that an e mail address is changed on hand held computer . As previously described hand held endpoint may synchronize with contact list database via their associated single ended synchronization agents and common synchronization engine . At the end of that synchronization session contact list data is synchronized with the phone book database of hand held computer . In a subsequent synchronization session without the participation of hand held computer e mail database may be synchronized with contact list database . As a result of this second synchronization e mail database receives the e mail address previously updated on hand held computer .

There are numerous advantages of a single ended synchronization agent when compared to the prior art. First a single ended synchronization agent need only understand the data formatting and storage requirements of a single database. In contrast the prior art double ended synchronization conduits were required to implement the data formatting and storage requirements of both databases which were typical radically different residing for example on different types of computers. Second the single ended synchronization agent does not perform the critical reconciliation of data that is fundamental to synchronization. A common synchronization engine e.g. common synchronization engine performs this task. Further most single ended synchronization software modules will not have to communicate with or process data on a hand held computer. It is anticipated that manufacturers of hand held computers will provide a synchronization agent for these purposes.

With one common synchronization engine all synchronization and reconciliation logic including possible multiple methodologies are common to all synchronization processing. Centralizing this function enables a single group of highly skilled practitioners to develop and maintain this critical software. In the prior art conduits every conduit developer had to implement all synchronization logic and methodologies resulting in widely divergent implementations of varying quality. In the prior art these numerous implementations often led to incompatibilities and malfunctions resulting in poor user experiences and costly service calls. Such disruptions in synchronization may reflect poorly on hand held computer manufacturers even though their provided hardware and software was not at fault.

A single ended synchronization agent moves data between its associated endpoint and a common synchronization engine. In order to accomplish this task the synchronization agent is able to perform at least two functions. First the synchronization agent is able to associate an object within the synchronization engine with a corresponding object in the agent s endpoint and associate an object within the agent s endpoint with a corresponding object in the synchronization engine. These objects will typically be records of a database for example contact list information for an individual.

Identification of objects is a rich field in the database arts and it is to be appreciated that many methods of identifying objects are well suited to embodiments of the present invention. Objects in the synchronization engine may be identified with a global unique identifier GUID. Objects in the endpoint generally may be identified in an application independent manner. It may be possible to use the endpoint s identifiers directly as GUIDs but if the endpoint uses an incompatible system of identification then a mapping should be maintained by the synchronization agent in order to match corresponding objects. The synchronization engine may provide a persistent GUID mapping applications programming interface API for synchronization agents to use.

A second function that is to be performed by a single ended synchronization agent is to deliver to a synchronization engine all data in the endpoint e.g. database that has changed since the last time a synchronization engine requested this same type of changed data. It is appreciated that a wide variety of methods may be used to identify objects that have changed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. For example one or more dirty bits may be set to indicate changes to an object and may be cleared after the object has been synchronized.

A pedigree is generally a change history of a database object and may be used to indicate if an object has changed since a synchronization session. Copending commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 159 461 filed May 31 2002 discloses a novel pedigree system that is well suited to embodiments of the present invention and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Depending on the pedigree capabilities of the endpoint at least four classes of synchronization agents are possible. An ignorant synchronization agent has no concept of pedigree in its endpoint dataset. It is also unable to determine what data has changed in its endpoint since the last synchronization. An ignorant synchronization agent can only provide the full dataset during a query. A simple synchronization agent has no concept of pedigree in its endpoint dataset. It uses a local cache that contains a view of the endpoint dataset at the time of the last sync. A simple synchronization agent uses this cache to determine the delta between the data in the Sync Engine and in its endpoint dataset. It provides this delta during a query. A normal synchronization agent uses a simple scheme to indicate a changed record in its endpoint for example like a dirty bit. This type of synchronization agent can provide a delta without using a cache but cannot determine what has changed since an arbitrary sync session. A smart synchronization agent uses a rich pedigree scheme in its endpoint dataset and can produce a delta for any sync session.

In order to simplify the interface between a common synchronization engine and synchronization agents it may be convenient to design the interface so that the common synchronization engine can only communicate with a smart synchronization agent that understands a particular pedigree system and a particular record identification system. In order to communicate and synchronize with databases that do not implement a chosen pedigree and or record identification system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention it may be necessary to utilize an agent booster. 

An agent booster may be constructed through the use of promoting application programming interfaces APIs . The following example of boosting the capabilities of an agent database illustrates some relative shortcomings of some types of databases and how an agent booster may overcome such deficiencies.

Consider a very common type of database a computer spread sheet e.g. endpoint spreadsheet of such as may be operated on by the Excel program commercially available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. Excel databases spreadsheets are quite capable in terms of identifying individual data records cells of the spreadsheet . However typical spreadsheets have no concept of change. For the purposes of synchronization this lack of a change history is a severe shortcoming and aligns this type of database with ignorant agents databases.

A booster agent for example booster agent of adds capabilities to the underlying database such that the combination of the database plus the booster agent are more suitable to synchronization and compatible with the common synchronization engine interface. In this exemplary case a booster agent may implement a persistent cache that records the state of the database after a synchronization session. When called to participate in a subsequent synchronization session the booster agent can compare the present state of the database with the cached version of the database maintained by the booster agent. Preferably a booster agent is able to interact with the database at a relatively low communications cost since a booster agent will typically exchange more information with a database than is normally required in exchanges between an agent and a synchronization engine.

In this novel manner the booster agent may determine differences e.g. deletions additions or changes to database records in the database farpoint between a prior synchronization session and the present time. By further maintaining a synchronization clock the booster agent may report coverage and respond to agenda and query synchronization rounds. As a result the booster agent has upgraded the capabilities of the database as seen by a synchronization engine and the combination is capable of rich synchronization. A booster agent may communicate directly with an endpoint for example booster agent communicating directly with endpoint or a booster agent may communicate with a less capable agent for example sync agent that communicates with an associated endpoint. It is appreciated that no changes need be made to the operation or storage formats of the underlying database in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.

Databases with greater pedigree capabilities that ignorant agents databases may also be boosted or upgraded. For example a simple agent as described previously may implement a local cache of its farpoint as described above. A booster for a simple agent may only be required to maintain a synchronization clock to implement the correct interface to a synchronization agent. Similarly a normal agent may have a limited capacity to identify changed records. A booster for this type of agent can maintain a synchronization clock and apply coverage to the change history maintained by the normal agent and its database farpoint.

In order to describe some of the functions and methods used in embodiments of the present invention synchronization sessions are oftentimes referred to as tea parties. The analogy is extended to include inviting synchronization agents to attend the parties. The parties usually have a theme which is generally understood to be a description of the type of information being synchronized for example calendar information. Synchronizing multiple databases will typically involve scheduling multiple parties with differing themes inviting agents interested in those themes and the like.

An agent single ended synchronization agent program is a software entity that wants to attend one or more tea parties and is prepared to behave appropriately. An agent may attend a tea party either as a tea party host or as a tea party guest. Every tea party has a Tea Party Theme for example the type of information to be synchronized. Agents attend tea parties because they are interested in the theme of the tea party. For example the agent is associated with represents a database that includes the particular type of data.

The purpose of a Tea Party is to potentially exchange information between databases. The agents at a tea party exchange information. Some of the information will relate to the tea party theme. One of the topics at a Tea Party is other Tea Parties. A Tea Party happens in three rounds namely the Agenda Round Query Round and Report Round.

The Tea Party Scheduler has a list of Tea Parties and which agent is hosting and which agent s are attending as guests. For example the first tea party on list is labeled calendar and has a hand held agent as host and a desk top calendar agent as a guest. The Tea Party Scheduler operates by taking the first Tea Party on its list and giving it sending the information to the Tea Party Manager software that operates the Tea Party.

The Tea Party Agenda is a detailed list of questions assembled at the beginning of a Tea Party. It is used to later query agents. The Tea Party Report produced during the Query Round is the assembled answers to the questions on the agenda.

The Tea Party Agenda Questionnaire comprises the questions handed out to each attending Tea Party Agent e.g. hand held agent and or desk top calendar agent during the Agenda Round of a Tea Party. There are two questions What questions do you have for the Agents at this party and What kind of questions do you feel qualified to answer These questions typically are answered by statements of coverage. For example I am able to answer questions provide information up to a given coverage and need information beyond that coverage. 

The Tea Party Query Questionnaire is a custom questionnaire given to a Tea Party Agent recipient by the Tea Party Manager during the Query Round of a Tea Party. It contains unanswered questions gathered earlier from other Tea Party Agents about areas of expertise declared by the recipient Tea Party Agent.

The Tea Party Report is a custom report given to a Tea Party Agent recipient by the Tea Party Manager during the Report Round of a Tea Party. It contains the available answers to the questions posed by the recipient during the earlier Agenda Round.

The Tea Party Manager gets a description of a Tea Party from the Tea Party Scheduler software module. The Tea Party Manager then conducts the Tea Party according to the proper Tea Party Procedure.

To initiate a tea party the Tea Party Manager contacts each Tea Party Host on the list of hosts for the Tea Party e.g. hand held agent . Each Tea Party Host responds by indicating whether or not they are willing to host the Tea Party. If no Tea Party Host is willing to host the party then the party is cancelled.

If at least one of the Tea Party Hosts is willing to host then all of the Tea Party Agents Guests and Hosts are contacted. They indicate whether they will be attending. Non attending agents are dropped from the list. Attending Tea Party Agents may also indicate their level of expertise on the Tea Party Theme. This is an efficiency consideration.

During the Agenda round the Tea Party Manager seeks to create a Tea Party Agenda . The Tea Party Manager asks all of the Tea Party Agents to fill out the Tea Party Agenda Questionnaire . The Tea Party Manager then gathers up this information and organizes it for use in the next round.

During the Query round the Tea Party Manager attempts to find answers to all of the questions on the Agenda . The Tea Party Manager ranks all of the attending Tea Party Agents according to their level of expertise on the Tea Party Theme. During the Query Round Tea Party Agents are queried in order of expertise. The most knowledgeable are queried first. The least knowledgeable are queried last in one example. For each Agent the Tea Party Manager prepares a custom questionnaire that contains all of the unanswered Tea Party Agenda questions within the area of expertise of the agent. The questionnaire is given to the agent. When the response is received the information is added to the Tea Party Report . The Tea Party Manager also modifies the Tea Party Agenda by removing fully answered questions and modifying partially answered questions to ask only the unanswered portion. The modified Tea Party Agenda is then used to query the next agent proceeding in this manner through all of the agents.

During the Report round the Tea Party Manager updates each of the agents. For each agent the Tea Party Manager produces a custom Tea Party Update. This is the Tea Party Report filtered to answer only the questions asked by the recipient agent during the Agenda Round. Each agent is given its Tea Party Update.

To complete a tea party the Tea Party Manager informs all of the agents that the party has completed.

The Tea Party Scheduler attends every Tea Party. It lists itself as knowledgeable about Tea Parties. Agents that want to get a party started ask the question during the Agenda Round Who wants to go to a party about happening During the Query Round agents can sign up for the party. The Tea Party Scheduler then schedules any parties with at least one host. This schedule is available during the Update Round. There are only two times at which parties can be scheduled namely Sooner or Later. A party scheduled as Sooner is placed at the front of the party list. A party scheduled Later is placed at the end of the party list.

The Tea Party Registration Agent runs a static registration service for its client Agents. Client agents statically register at install time for specific parties. It is the job of the Tea Party Registration Agent to make sure that the correct Tea Parties are scheduled and that they include the correct clients. The Tea Party Registration Agent generates proxy agents for its clients. These proxy agents are registered dynamically for parties and the proxies then handle loading and unloading clients when the Tea Party occurs.

Agents that are clients of the Tea Party Registration Agent can list Tea Party Themes that interest them. There are standard fields to specify such as user device id creator id database type database name category etc. These fields can be left blank filled in with a specific value or marked as a wild card. The client also specifies whether to attend as a host or as a guest. Wild cards are not allowed when registering as a host.

A special type of tea party is a floating tea party. An executable software program can call the Tea Party Scheduler to schedule a Tea Party. If registered client agents are wanted as guests or hosts then it is a good idea to include the Tea Party Registration Agent as a host and to also choose an appropriate theme.

In step a tea party is scheduled. Tea parties can be scheduled for many reasons e.g. in response to a question received during a previous tea party or in response to a specific event for example a single from a synchronization cradle.

In step agents are invited to the tea party. In step agents that have indicated a desire to attend the tea party are asked questions as to what questions the agents have for other participants in the tea party and as to what information the agents can supply. These questions form an agenda for the tea party. As discussed above the questions take the form of What does a specific agent know and What does a specific agent want to know These questions typically are answered by statements of coverage. For example a specific agent is able to answer questions provide information up to a given coverage and it requests information beyond that coverage.

In step the questions on the tea party agenda are asked of the agents attending the tea party and available answers are received.

In step the answers received in step are distributed to the agents of the tea party. In an optimization the answers may be directed to only the agent asking a question calling for a particular answer.

In addition to agents that synchronize with common databases for example a calendar or phonebook databases there may be a number of more specialized agents participating in a synchronization session. These agents are designed to perform special functions and generally typical application programs do not access their endpoints. In some cases prior art implementations of such functions required specialized two ended conduits and specialized databases or endpoints on at least one side of the conduit. In contrast as described previously the present single ended synchronization agents communicate with a single database for example a special database. Unlike the prior art two ended conduits such agents are not burdened by the complexities of interacting with a second database.

One such specialized synchronization agent is backup agent of . Such an agent may save data to disks for example floppy disks or compact discs represented by removable media device of in a form that is partitionable and restorable. Partitionable implies that each dataset should be backed up to a separate disk file. This is to enable data transfer between users by distributing the file. This file should be restorable for any user.

A second type of specialized synchronization agent is restore agent of . A restore agent can be complimentary to a backup agent.

Another specialized synchronization agent is a handheld agent for example hand held synchronization agent of . The hand held agent may participate in multiple synchronization sessions for a variety of types of data. As a participant in various synchronization sessions the handheld agent moves data from a handheld computer to the synchronization engine and moves information from the synchronization engine to the hand held computer. Because the hand held agent synchronizes all of the handheld based data with the common synchronization engine most developers of hand held applications may not have to write handheld code when developing single ended synchronization agents. Developers may only need to create code for moving data between the synchronization engine and their endpoint. In contrast with the prior art double ended conduits since one endpoint was a hand held database developers of hand held applications were required to create a complete conduit.

Yet another special synchronization agent is device information agent of . A device information agent collects the primarily user selectable preferences and features of the handheld computer so that they may be accessed later. It may store this data in a disk based persistent store not shown on a desktop computer and allows access to that information through a set of applications programming interfaces APIs. It is to be appreciated that device information agent communicates with hand held computer through common synchronization engine and hand held synchronization agent .

Install agent of is a specialized single ended synchronization agent to install code and data onto a hand held computer. Programs and the like may be downloaded for example from internet websites onto desk top computer system transferred and loaded onto hand held computer via install agent . It is to be appreciated that install agent communicates with hand held computer through common synchronization engine and hand held synchronization agent .

A novel special type of synchronization agent is a caching agent for example caching agent of . Such an agent acts as an intermediary between a temporary working memory used by the Synchronization Engine used for reconciliation during synchronization sessions and a data structure in long term memory for example a file on rotating magnetic media not shown . Saving information to a long term memory gives persistence to the results of sync parties.

During a synchronization session all of the agents associated with a data type typically attend that particular synchronization party. However in practice a number of situations may arise in which all agents associated with a data type are not available. For example a handheld computer may not be connected to a desktop computer a central synchronization server may not be online or a wireless connection may be dropped. Thus because not all of the endpoints may be present the corresponding agents may not be able to attend the party. These absent agents are of course not able to process the deltas for the current synchronization session and later will have to catch up. The data in the persistent cache allows these tardy agents to do just that.

For example database S is maintained on a remote server. Database D is maintained on removable media on a desktop computer. Database H is maintained on a hand held computer. The hand held computer and the desktop computer may be connected together to synchronize their common databases at a point in time during which the desktop computer is unable to communicate with the server. The desktop computer and the hand held computer complete their synchronization such that database D and database H are synchronized. At a later time when database D has been removed from the desktop computer the desktop computer and the server are able to communicate. Due to the persistent store and a caching agent database S can be synchronized even though neither database D nor database H are available.

The Caching Agent will attend all sync parties whose theme implies the reconciliation of data. The agent will read from the persistent store during the query round and will write out a new file during the report round. A caching agent attends as guest Tea Parties with themes organized around databases for which it is configured to provide caching. During the Agenda Round it asks What s new with this database that I don t know and lists itself as an expert on the data it has in its cache. During the Query Round it will receive queries for data that It has in its cache. During the Report Round it will receive updates to add to its cache.

A way is provided for a set of coordinating agents to request that information from their databases not be cached. This is for agent developers that do not want to have a disk based representation of the data e.g. for security reasons.

A role of a common synchronization engine is to detect and reconcile conflicts for example records from two or more endpoints that have been modified such that the reconciliation action will result in a conflicted state. Preferably the conflict should be resolved in the application program that uses the database e.g. on the handheld computer or on the desktop since that application is capable of displaying the data to a user. Consequently identified conflicts may not be resolved during the synchronization session. The resolution may be indefinitely postponed and the conflicted state may be retained.

A specialized conflict resolution agent of may resolve conflicts according to a set of user modifiable rules. Such an agent should only resolve conflicts for a dataset when there is no other possibility for resolution.

In optional step an agent program retrieves information from its database that has changed since a last synchronization session.

In step a synchronization engine program accesses information that has changed since a last synchronization session from a plurality of agent programs.

In step a synchronization engine program determines that an information record from one of the agent programs is unknown to another of the agent programs.

In step a synchronization engine program sends the unknown information to the unknowing agent program. Optionally a synchronization engine program may detect that two or more agents have an information for the same record that is unknown to other agents. In this situation the synchronization engine program may identify such information records as being in conflict prior to providing the new records to all other than the providing agents.

In this novel manner single ended agent programs in cooperation with a common synchronization engine are able to synchronize databases. There are numerous advantages of this method over the prior art including that the agent programs do not implement synchronization logic and agent programs are required to understand only a single database. These aspects of the novel single ended agent programs greatly simplify the design construction and maintenance of this software when compared with the prior art. Such improvements in this field may result in greater deployment of higher quality synchronization systems than is currently present in the industry.

In order to more fully describe aspects of the present invention portions of the application programming interface used by single ended synchronization agents are hereby provided. More specifically a set of software functions that perform various synchronization tasks are defined. Also explained are some of the structures and parameters needed to correctly call these functions. It is appreciated that other implementations of such functions are well suited to embodiments of the present invention.

According to an embodiment of the present invention single ended synchronization agents define an interface with a Synchronization Manager Sync Manager and a Synchronization Engine. A Synchronization Manager uses this interface to coordinate or schedule a synchronization session.

The interface can be viewed as notifications sent by the Synchronization Manager to the agent however each of these notifications is accomplished by calling a corresponding entry point within the agent. The Synchronization Engine reconciles the data using an internal memory based cache.

Preferably the interfaces use handles to access data structures. APIs provide access information given a handle to that data structure. This method abstracts the data in a language independent manner.

Agents are dynamically loaded by the Sync Manager and are executed by calling into their entry points. Note the difference between a synchronization agent as a dynamically loadable module and an instance of that module during execution. There is typically only one copy of a particular Agent on the desktop computer and that copy the module is loaded by the Sync Manager. During a synchronization session however instances of a particular agent may execute many times. For example an Agent Module may wish to attend multiple synchronization sessions and thus an instance of that Agent will be run for each session. It is also possible to have multiple instances of the same Agent Module attend the same session. This is recommended for Agents whose far point is a standards based protocol that may be used by different applications. The following two entry points are called by the Sync Manager to interrogate an Agent Module to determine the number of instances and the synchronization sessions they attend.

This entry point is called by the Sync Manager to get global information relating to the Agent Module. This information is its unique ID its persistence and its version.

This entry point is called by the Sync Manager to get instance specific information from the Agent Module. Each time the Sync Manager calls this entry point the Agent Module returns information about a specific instance of the Agent. This information includes a unique instance ID a displayable instance name and the theme where this Agent may attend.

This entry point is called by the Synchronization Manager after a request is made to begin a synchronization session.

This entry point is called by the Sync Manager after SyncSessionBegin has completed and before any themes are placed on the scheduling queue.

This entry point is called by the Sync Manager when it processes the next theme on the queue. Each agent is called and allowed to state whether or not they will attend the specific synchronization session party .

Each agent that has indicated that it will attend a sync session is called. This entry point is called before any syncing is done.

Each agent in the sync session is asked for its level of expertise and its area of interest. A level of expertise is the set of data questions an agent can answer. Later SyncPartyQuery the Sync Manager may ask this agent these questions. Area of interest is the set of data questions the agent requires an answer to. Later SyncPartyReport the Sync Manager may present the agent a set of answers.

During the agenda round agents indicated what questions they answered. Agents also stated what information they require. For each question and answer correspondence the appropriate agent is called and asked the indicated question.

This entry point is called into each agent attending a sync session when all of the synchronization rounds are finished.

This entry point is called by the Sync Manager when all of the themes in the queue have been processed. Every agent is called.

This entry point is called by Sync Manager after all of the post sync processing has completed. All agents are called.

This entry point is called if the synchronization session terminates abnormally and one of the agents is currently processing a notification. Only that agent s entry point will be called.

During a synchronization session the synchronization engine will call the agents to inform them as to the state of the synchronization session and to give the agents an opportunity to direct and participate in synchronization sessions parties .

A theme handle is a handle name to the synchronization theme or type of data being synchronized. This is an abstract data structure maintained by the Sync Manager. The agent can use a set of Theme APIs to access information about the theme.

There are two contexts in which themes are presented. The first is when an application makes a call into the Sync Manager to initiate a synchronization session. That application will pass in a theme. The theme indicates why the sync is being initiated e.g. it could be a sync for a specific database creator ID or a manufacturer defined theme created to handle special synchronization sessions. The theme is the theme of the entire synchronization session.

The other context in which a theme is presented is during the synchronization parties. In this context the theme defines the purpose of the party. The theme for a party context is only valid for the duration of the party.

 Synchronization Context is an abstract data structure maintained by the Sync Manager. The Sync Context encapsulates state information that enables information sharing and re entrancy. The Sync Context may be seen as a set of environments that contain attributes defined as keyword value pairs.

In general there are three primary data environments e.g. spans of data access associated with synchronization according to an embodiment of the present invention. These data environments are session theme and agent. The session environment is shared by all agents and any keyword contained in that environment is available to any agent throughout the entire synchronization session. The theme environment is shared by all agents that are participating in the sync party for that theme. Keywords in the theme environment are no longer valid after the conclusion of that sync party. The agent context provides a private space for each agent. These keywords are persistent throughout the entire synchronization session.

This data structure is used to pass Agent Module information from the Agent Module to the Sync Manager. It is used during the AgentModuleGetInfo all.

This data structure is used to pass Agent Instance information from the Agent Module to the Sync Manager. Each time the Sync Manager calls the Agent Module this data structure is used. Each use of the data structure corresponds to information regarding a single Agent Instance.

The Sync Manager calls the Agent Module to obtain module specific information. The Sync Manager calls this entry point in the Agent Module once when it is loaded for the first time. This call is independent of synchronization sessions.

The Sync Manager calls the Agent Module to obtain instance specific information. When a parameter is true non zero the Sync Manager will call this entry point again in order to get information about the next Agent Instance. When there are no more instances to talk about the Agent Module sets this to false zero. Note that in most cases there is only a single Agent Instance per Agent Module. The Sync Manager presets this parameter to false zero so an Agent Module need not modify it except in the case that there are additional instances.

This is the first notification sent out by the Sync Manager. It is an indication that a synchronization session is about to start. The Sync Manager sends this notification to every agent once per synchronization session. Agents can use this notification to decide if the sync should begin for the given user. An agent can choose to cancel or abort the sync by calling the Sync Manager s cancel function.

This notification is sent before the Sync Manager starts any sync parties. It provides an opportunity for agents to perform any initialization. The Sync Manager sends this notification to every agent once per synchronization session. Agents can use this notification to perform any initialization before sync parties start . The Device Info Agent collects extended device information at this time.

This notification is sent after all sync parties have been completed. It provides an opportunity for agents to perform any clean up. The Sync Manager sends this notification to every agent once per synchronization session. Agents can use this notification to perform any clean up activity after all sync parties have completed . This is an opportunity for backup agents to backup databases and files to the desktop. Device administration or inventory type agents can also collect device information at this time. The Device Info Agent could also collect extended device information at this time.

This notification is sent by the Sync Manager to indicate that the sync session for the specified user is about to terminate. Parameters are either an enumerated type or a string indicating the reason that the sync was cancelled. If this is a string it should be possible to localize it. The Sync Manager sends this notification to every agent once per sync session.

This notification is sent asynchronously by the Sync Manager to indicate that the sync session has been cancelled. This API may have two parameters. A state is the state of the sync when it was cancelled. It may also indicate which agent cancelled the synchronization session. A reason is either an enumerated type or a string indicating the reason that the synchronization session was cancelled. If this is a string it should be possible to localize it.

This notification is called by the Sync Manager when processing the next theme on the queue. Every agent is called and given the opportunity to join or refuse the sync party invitation. The parameter is answer for the invitation. An agent sets this Boolean to true if attending the sync party false otherwise. Not setting the parameter is equivalent of setting it to false.

This notification is sent by the Sync Manager after the set of participating agents is known but before any data processing has occurred. This allows the agents to perform initialization.

This notification is sent by the Sync Manger to all of the agents in the currently scheduled sync party one theme . Each agent directs the sync by presenting set of questions the query and answers the level of expertise . A first parameter of this call is query expertise. This parameter is an abstract data structure that contains a set of creator Id database names category Id triples that defines either a question or answer. A second parameter is round. This is the round number. The synchronization component of a sync party agenda query report may occur several times. This allows agents to order synchronization in the case of data dependencies.

The Sync Manager calls this notification to ask a question of an agent in the sync party. The question will always correspond to one of the queries returned to the Sync Manager in the expertise parameter of the SyncPartyAgenda call. There are three parameters to this call query answer and round.

A query is an abstract data structure that contains a creator Id database names category Id triple that defines a question. An answer is an abstract data type that contains the answer to the question. The answer is in the form of a set of data records that match the attributes of the question and are records which are new changed or deleted since the last time this question was asked. The round parameter is the round number. The synchronization component of a sync party agenda query report may occur several times. This allows agents

This notification is called by the Sync Manager to present the answers to an agent that were asked during the agenda round. The three parameters are answer round and repeat. The answer parameter is the answer to the question. The round parameter is the current round number. If the repeat parameter is left alone or set to false no subsequent sync round will occur. If set to true an additional sync round will follow. If any agent in the sync party requests an additional round all agents will participate in the new round.

This notification is called by the Synchronization Manager after all of the synchronization rounds are completed for a sync party one theme . Each agent in the synchronization session party is called. This allows any agents to perform clean up. This notification contains a single parameter reason. Reason is either an enumerated type or a string indicating the reason that the sync was cancelled. If this is a string it should be possible to localize it.

There may be at least three entry points to an agent namely agenda query and update. According to an embodiment of the present invention these entry points correspond to rounds or phases of a synchronization process.

These three rounds allow an agent to provide and or receive synchronization information. In the agenda round an agent inquires of a common synchronization engine for updates to the agent s database. In addition the agent identifies the database that it represents and provides information as to the level of information that the database contains. Likewise the agent also informs the common synchronization engine of the agent s expertise for example the information contained within the database. It is frequently the case that the inquiry and expertise contain the same information. For example a database may generally be able to provide information to a certain level and request any updates beyond that level. It is to be appreciated however that the inquiry and expertise may not contain the same information. For example an agent representing a database contained on read only media e.g. a CD ROM may describe expertise while making no inquiries since its database is incapable of storing new information. A data logging agent for example a program used to make a permanent copy of financial transactions may appear as write only memory. Such an agent might inquire e.g. for all information and profess no expertise.

One method of describing the level of information in a database is by coverage. Co pending commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 159 462 filed May 31 2002 entitled Fast Synchronization of Computer Databases Using Coverage Status discloses a novel system of coverage that is well suited to embodiments of the present invention and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

It is to be appreciated that other methods of maintaining and describing the level of information in a database are well suited to embodiments of the present invention. Co pending commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 710 605 filed Nov. 10 2000 entitled Optimized Database Technique to Enable Faster Data Synchronization to McCaw is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 6 000 000 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 710 605 describe additional methods of maintaining and describing the level of information in a database.

Multiple synchronization agents may provide queries and expertise during an agenda round. After completing an agenda round a common synchronization engine may determine which database contain updated information. For example given a list of agent queries and statements of expertise in the form of coverage a common synchronization engine may determine which database s contained updated information. It is to be appreciated that no single database may contain all information necessary to represent a new coverage and that in general information may be retrieved from more than one database.

Having determined a new coverage a common synchronization engine accesses database information from source database agents during the query round. In the report round information is provided to destination database agents in order to bring the databases up to the new coverage level.

In step a synchronization clock is maintained for the database. The synchronization clock may be unique to the database or multiple databases may utilize a single synchronization clock. According to an embodiment of the present invention the synchronization clock may be a monotonic sequence of symbols for example a count of integers which only increases. As described previously a synchronization clock should be advanced to the next symbol e.g. to the next number when the database is synchronized.

In step the present value of the synchronization clock is added to a description of coverage of the database in response to a change to a data element of the database. For example if record number of database D is modified while the D synchronization clock is at 81 then D 81 may be added to the coverage of database D. It is appreciated that the pedigree of record may also be updated using the synchronization clock to reflect the modification.

In optional step a description of coverage of the database may be replaced with a present value of the synchronization clock and a database identifier. For example building upon the previous example prior to the modification of record the coverage of database D may have been T20636D80. Step above may have modified the coverage to produce T20636D80D81. The present step may replace a previous coverage of the database D with the present value of the synchronization clock and database identifier. This may simplify the new coverage to T20636D81 as the replaced value may be redundant. Including this step in a method may improve the storage and transmission requirements associate with database coverage.

During an agenda round of synchronization agent A sends coverage information A10D5 to common synchronization engine . In similar manners agent B sends coverage B52D3 and agent C sends coverage C47 to common synchronization engine .

Common synchronization engine determines maximum coverage source s of database information corresponding to the maximum coverage and the information needed by each database to bring its coverage to the maximum level. Optionally common synchronization agent may determine the minimum or delta information needed by each database to bring its coverage to the maximum level. For example using the exemplary coverages of the maximum coverage is AIOB52C47D5. This is determined by combining the coverage of each database and simplifying any duplicate database identifiers. For example both database A and database B have information from database D. Database A s information has a higher coverage with respect to database D. Consequently its coverage supersedes the coverage of database B.

During a query round common synchronization engine inquires of the agents databases for the actual database information represented by the coverage or the delta information needed to update a database to the maximum coverage. For example inquiry asks agent A to provide all A type records and all D type records since no other database present has A type records. Although database B has some D type records it requires updates to bring it to coverage level D5. In addition database C has no D type records and consequently needs them all.

Similarly inquiry asks agent B to provide all B type records since no other database present has B type records. As noted above agent B may not be asked for type D records.

As a second portion of the query round the agents send the requested information to common synchronization engine . For example information transmittal sends all A type records and all D type records from database agent A to common synchronization engine . Likewise information transmittal sends all B type records from database agent B and information transmittal sends all C type records from database agent C .

In the report or update round common synchronization engine redistributes the information records to the agents databases that need the information. For example update information sends all A B and D records to agent C . Likewise update information sends all B and C information to agent A .

Update information sends all A and C information to agent B . However common synchronization engine may only send records of type D and D to agent B since database B has previously indicated that it has D type records through coverage level D. Sending only the difference or delta information optimizes the amount of information transferred. Such optimizations may be important for communication channels such as wireless links which have a relatively high communication cost or are otherwise bandwidth limited. It is to be appreciated that synchronization agents subsequently update their respective databases.

Performing synchronization with a remote device that has a time lag or other communication costs can lead to a desire to limit the communication to a single round in order to minimize the communication cost. The term one up one down means that there is a single communication in one direction followed by a single communication in the other direction. This constraint can be incorporated into the Tea Party protocol if the remote e.g. wirelessly connected device instigates the synchronization. This is covered below in the First Case scenario. If the remote device is passively responding to a request for synchronization then the constraint cannot be met in a single Tea Party. Either two Tea Parties are required second case or a One Down One Up One Down protocol is required third case .

In a first case in which a remote device initiates a synchronization the down side device first contacts its remote agent. The remote agent e.g. agent for the remote device schedules a Tea Party for the appropriate database.

During an agenda round the remote agent asserts the question What is new in since . The remote agent declares expertise on contents of from 

During a query round the remote agent supplies its delta information assuming any other agent was interested. During a report round the remote agent receives its update report.

In a second case in which a remote device responds to a request for synchronization synchronization may be accomplished by conducting two tea parties synchronization sessions .

During a first agenda round the remote agent asserts question What is new in since The remote agent declares expertise on covering everything .

During a first query round the remote agent receives and saves all queries regarding the database. During a first report update round the remote agent receives an update report for its far point.

At the end of the first synchronization session the remote agent transmits the update report to the remote device along with the questions from the query round. If there is new information possessed by the remote device it formulates a response and sends it back.

During a second agenda round the remote agent declares no questions. It declares expertise on the information received from the remote device. During a second query round the remote device receives questions relating to the data it is holding. It provides the requested information. Since the remote agent asked no questions during the second query round the remote agent receives nothing in its update report. The remote agent retains coverage information for use in responding to any new Tea Parties.

In a third case in which a remote device responds to a request for synchronization synchronization may be accomplished by a one down one up one down communication sequence.

During an agenda round the remote agent asserts question What is new in since The remote agent declares expertise on covering everything. 

During a query round the remote agent transmits the query to the remote device. When the query is received the remote device formulates a response which it sends. The remote agent returns this response. In a report update round the remote agent sends the update report to the remote device. The remote agent retains coverage information for use in responding to any new Tea Parties synchronization sessions .

In the first case the remote device anticipates the query and provides a response to the query before the actual query occurs. The upload information may therefore contain information that no agent wants for example because it was already provided via another agent or pathway. 

In the second case the query is sent to the remote device but not actually answered by the remote agent in the first query round. It may therefore contain questions that were subsequently provided by other agents. Also the coverage of the remote agent is anticipated. If the remote device has alternative synchronization pathways then it might be more up to date than anticipated and receive information it already has. Further if there is more than one remote agent the limitation to one up one down may be effectively broken by having several sequential tea parties.

The third case avoids querying the remote agent for unwanted information at the expense of having a second upload. Unlike the second case it avoids degenerating into multiple uploads and downloads via cascading tea parties. Like the second case it anticipates the prior coverage of the remote device. If the remote device has alternative synchronization pathways then it might be more up to date than indicated. Other agents may be queried to provide this unnecessary information. Sending it to the remote device can be avoided in the third case by the remote agent filtering it out a task normally provide by the tea party manager.

The third case is the only case of the three in which the trip delay latency of communicating with a remote device is added into the total synchronization time. The first case avoids this because the remote device is the starting cause for synchronization. The second case avoids this by not starting a second tea party until the remote data is available.

The preferred embodiment of the present invention N way synchronization of computer databases is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments but rather construed according to the below claims.
