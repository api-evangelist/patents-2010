This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009 149694 filed on Jun. 24 2009 in Japanese Patent Office the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor hereafter also referred to merely as a photoreceptor an image formation method an image formation apparatus and a process cartridge used for an electrophotographic image formation and in more detail relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor an image formation method an image formation apparatus and a process cartridge used for the electrophotographic image formation employed in the field of a copier or a printer.

Recently there have been increased opportunities of using electrophotographic copiers or printers in the field of printing or color printing. There is a strong trend of requiring high quality digital black and white or color images in such fields of printing or color printing. In response to such a requirement there has been proposed formation of high precision digital images by use of a short wavelength laser light Patent Documents 1 and 2 . However the current condition is that even when forming a precise electrostatic latent image on an electrophotographic photoreceptor by use of a short wavelength laser light and reducing the exposure diameter the finally obtained electrophotographic image does not achieve sufficiently high image quality.

The cause thereof is due to the fact that there were not sufficiently addressed newly generated problems in images obtained by imagewise exposure at relatively short wavelengths.

As a first problem in a conventional photoreceptor developed for a longer wavelength laser light light transmittance for a shorter wavelength laser light has not been fully enough whereby no excellent sensitivity characteristics has been obtained. This is due to the light absorption range of a charge transport material extended to a portion of 400 nm or more. As a result no uniform picture image cannot be obtained for example due to the effect of an uneven film thickness. On the other hand a charge transport material which does not substantially have absorption in 400 nm or more had a problem in image stability because of the inferior light stability of the charge transport material. It was found by the present inventor that this problem can be overcome by employing a prescribed charge transport material as disclosed in Patent Document 3.

As a second problem the transfer current increases as the diameter of the toner is decreased in order to obtain a higher quality image employing a short wavelength laser. When the transfer current is increased a problem of transfer memory tends to occur in the photoreceptor. Specifically in a photoreceptor employing a phthalocyanine pigment as a charge generation material the transfer memory is easy to occur.

An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photoreceptor in which deterioration of the stability in potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use is prevented while exhibiting a high transfer property and an excellent suppression effect of a transfer memory even when a high density electrostatic latent image is formed on the electrophotographic photoreceptor by using light of a wavelength of 350 500 nm as well as to provide an image forming method an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge each employing aforementioned electrophotographic photoreceptor.

It was found in the present invention that by simultaneously employing i a charge generation material having a prescribed crystal structure and a suitable particle diameter and ii a prescribed charge transfer material exhibiting an excellent transmittance of light having a shorter wavelength an electrophotographic photoreceptor which simultaneously overcomes the above first and second problems improves the transmittance of light of a short wavelength laser sensitivity to light of a short wavelength laser prevents deterioration of the stability in electric potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use and improves the problem of a transfer memory can be obtained.

According to the present invention provided is an electrophotographic photoreceptor in which deterioration of the stability in potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use is prevented while providing a high density dot image and exhibiting an excellent suppression effect of a transfer memory even when a high density electrostatic latent image is formed on the electrophotographic photoreceptor by using light of a wavelength of 350 500 nm as well as an image forming method an image foaming apparatus and a process cartridge each employing aforementioned electrophotographic photoreceptor can be provided.

The embodiments to carry out the present invention will be described below however the present invention is not limited thereto.

Hereafter the electrophotographic photoreceptor of the present invention will be described in detail.

The electrophotography photoreceptor of the present invention is characterized in that the electrophotography photoreceptor comprises an electrically conductive support having thereon a photo sensitive layer having a laminated structure comprising a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer wherein the charge generation layer comprises a titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having a crystal structure exhibiting the following peaks of Bragg angles 2 0.2 of X ray powder diffraction employing a characteristic X ray of a CuK radiation having a wavelength of 1.542 at least a largest diffraction peak at 27.2 major diffraction peaks at 9.4 9.6 and 24.0 and a diffraction peak of a lowest angle at 7.3 while exhibiting no peak between the peaks of 7.3 and 9.4 and no peak at 26.3 and the charge transport layer comprises a compound represented by above Formula 1 or 2 .

In the electrophotographic photoreceptor of the present invention by having the above structures when a high density electrostatic latent image is formed on the electrophotographic photoreceptor by using light of a wavelength of 350 500 nm deterioration of the stability in potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use can be prevented and simultaneously a transfer memory can be suppressed whereby a high density dot image can be formed.

The titanyl phthalocyanine pigment according to the present of the invention is a pigment of a compound having the following chemical structure.

The titanyl phthalocyanine pigment according to the present invention has the aforementioned crystalline feature in the X ray diffraction spectrum employing CuK radiation as a radiation source. The technique which applied the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment of this crystal form to a electrophotography photoreceptor has been disclosed for example in JP A No. 2006 276829.

However when the photoreceptor employing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment of this crystal form is used in an image forming method in which an imagewise exposure employing light of a short wavelength laser emitting light of wavelength of 350 nm 500 nm is carried out deterioration of sensitivity under repeated use or occurrence of transfer memory tends to occur. In the present invention as the result of intensive investigation it was found that these problems can be overcome by laminating a charge transport layer containing a compound represented by above Formula 1 or 2 on the charge generation layer containing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having the aforementioned crystal structure.

The method of preparing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having the aforementioned crystal structure has been disclosed for example in JP A No. 2006 276829.

The method to obtain the crystal structure of the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment according to the present invention and description of the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 will be mentioned below.

 Method to Obtain the Crystal Structure of the Titanyl Phthalocyanine Pigment According to the Present Invention 

The synthetic method of a titanyl phthalocyanine crystal of having the prescribed crystal structure employed in the present invention here will be described.

The synthesis method of a crude titanyl phthalocyanine crystal will be described. The synthetic method of a phthalocyanine compound has been known for many years.

For example a method to heat a mixture of a phthalic anhydride a metal or a metal halide and urea under existence or non existence of a high boiling point solvent may be cited as a 1st method. In this case a catalyst such as an ammonium molybdate is used together if needed. As a 2nd method a ng point solvent may be cited. This method is used for phthalocyanine compounds for example aluminum phthalocyanine indium phthalocyanine oxo vanadium phthalocyanine oxo titanium phthalocyanine and zirconium phthalocyanine which cannot be synthesized by the 1st method. In a 3rd method a phthalic anhydride or a phthalonitrile is reacted first with ammonia to form for example an intermediate such as 1 3 diiminoisoindrine followed by heating with a metal halide in a high boiling point solvent. In a 4th method a phthalonitrile compound is reacted with a metal alkoxide under existence of such as urea. The 4th method is an extremely useful method as a synthetic method of an electrophotographic material and extremely effectively used in the present invention because halogenation chlorination of a benzene ring hardly occurs.

Next a synthetic method of an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine will be described. This method includes dissolving phthalocyanine in a sulfuric acid and diluting with water to re deposit the crystal. An acid paste method or an acid slurry method can be applied for this method.

As a concrete method the aforementioned crude material is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid of an amount of 10 50 times insoluble matter is removed by filtering if necessary and the product is gradually added to thoroughly cooled water or ice water of an amount of 10 50 times of the amount of the sulfuric acid to re deposit titanyl phthalocyanine. After filtering the deposited titanyl phthalocyanine it is washed with ion exchanged water followed by filtering. This procedure is repeated until the filtrate exhibits neutrality. Finally the product is washed with clean ion exchanged water and then filtered to obtain a water paste having a solid content of 5 15 by mass.

It is important to reduce the amount of residual sulfuric acid as small as possible by thoroughly washing the deposit with ion exchanged water. Specifically it is preferable that the ion exchanged water after washing shows the following property values. Namely the amount of residual sulfuric acid can be expressed in terms of a pH value or a specific conductance of the ion exchanged water after washing. When it is expressed with a pH value it is desirable that the pH value is in the range of 6 8. When the pH value is in this range it can be concluded that the amount of residual sulfur is an amount which hardly affect the property of the photoreceptor. When the amount of residual sulfuric acid is expressed with a specific conductance it is desirable that the specific conductance is not more than 8 S cm more preferably not more than 6 S cm and still more preferably not more than 3 S cm. When the specific conductance is in this range it can be concluded that the amount of residual sulfur is an amount which hardly affect the property of the photoreceptor. The pH value or the specific conductance of out of the above range is not preferred since the amount of residual sulfuric acid is too large whereby the chargeability of the photoreceptor may be lowered or the light sensitivity may be deteriorated.

The titanyl phthalocyanine thus prepared an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine . It is preferable that the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine exhibits at least a largest peak in 7.0 7.5 of diffraction peaks 0.2 of Bragg angles 2 in X ray diffraction employing a characteristic X ray of a CuK radiation having a wavelength of 1.542 . It is specifically preferable that the half height width of the diffraction peak is 1 or more. Further it is preferable that the average particle diameter of the primary particles is 0.1 m or less.

The transformation of the crystal is a process in which the aforementioned amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine is transformed into a crystalline titanyl phthalocyanine having a crystal structure exhibiting the following Bragg angles 2 0.2 of X ray diffraction employing a characteristic X ray of a CuK radiation having a wavelength of 1.542 

As a specific method aforementioned amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine without drying is mixed with an organic solvent under existence of water and stirred to obtain the aforementioned crystal structure.

As the organic solvent used in this process any organic solvent may be used as far as a desired crystal structure is obtained however a preferable result is obtained when one of tetrahydrofuran toluene methylene chloride carbon disulfide o dichlorobenzene and 1 1 2 trichloroethane is selected. These organic solvents is preferably used alone however a mixture of two or more of these organic solvents or a mixture of one of the above organic solvents and other solvent may be used. The amount of the aforementioned organic solvent used for transformation of the crystal structure is preferably 10 times or more and more preferably 30 times or more of the mass of the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine . This is because the crystal structure can be quickly transformed and because the impurity contained in the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine can be fully removed. The amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine used herein is prepared via an acid paste method. It is preferable to use an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine from which sulfuric acid is fully removed as aforementioned. When the transformation of the crystal structure is carried out while sulfuric acid is remained ions of sulfuric acid remain in the crystal particles which cannot be fully removed even when the procedure described in the washing process is conducted. When sulfuric acid is remained in the crystal the sensitivity and chargeability of the photoreceptor may be lowered. For example a method to transform the crystal structure by pouring a titanyl phthalocyanine dissolved in sulfuric acid into an organic solvent together with ion exchanged water has been disclosed. In this method a titanyl phthalocyanine exhibiting X ray diffraction peaks similar to the peaks observed in the titanyl phthalocyanine of the present invention. However the concentration of sulfuric acid ion in the titanyl phthalocyanine is high resulting in the inferior light attenuation property light sensitivity whereby being unfavorable as a preparation method of a titanyl phthalocyanine of the present invention.

Specific examples of a constitution of the electrophotographic photoreceptor according to the present invention will be shown below 

1 A layer arrangement of a conductive support having thereon a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer in the said sequence as photosensitive layers 

2 A layer arrangement of a conductive support having thereon a charge generation layer a first charge transport layer and a second charge transport layer in the said sequence as photosensitive layers 

3 A layer arrangement of a conductive support having thereon a single layer containing a charge generation material and a charge transport material as a photosensitive layer 

4 A layer arrangement of a conductive support having thereon a charge transport layer and a charge generation layer in the said sequence as photosensitive layers 

5 A layer arrangement having a surface protective layer over a layer arrangement of any one of above 1 4 .

Above layer arrangements 1 4 containing a charge generation layer containing a charge generation material and a charge transport layer containing a charge transport material are preferable embodiments of the present invention. In the present invention a layer arrangement of above 2 is most preferably employed.

The electrophotographic photoreceptor of the present invention preferably has an intermediate layer or a subbing layer formed on the conductive support before providing a photosensitive layer irrespective of the above layer arrangements.

Next the layer arrangement of the electrophotographic photoreceptor will be described focusing on the layer arrangement of above 2 .

Any of an electrically conductive support in the form of a sheet and a cylindrical conductive support which is used for a photoreceptor may be employed but in order to compactly design an image forming apparatus the cylindrical conductive support is preferable.

The cylindrical conductive support means a cylindrical support to endlessly form images via rotation and the conductive support having a straightness of 0.1 mm or less and a swing width of 0.1 mm or less is preferable. When the straightness and the swing width exceed the above described ranges good images are difficult to be formed.

As to the conductive material a metal drum made of aluminum nickel or the like a plastic drum on which aluminum tin oxide indium oxide or the like is evaporated and a paper or plastic drum on which a conductive material is coated are usable. The conductive support preferably has a specific resistance of 10 cm or less at room temperature. The conductive support of the present invention is most preferably an aluminum support. The aluminum support in which a component of manganese zinc magnesium or the like in addition to aluminum as a principal component is mixed is utilized. Intermediate layer

In the present invention an intermediate layer is preferably formed between the conductive support and a photosensitive layer.

In the intermediate layer used in the present invention preferably contains metal oxide particles. Specifically N type semiconductor particles exhibiting N type property are preferably contained. The N type semiconductor particles refer to particles exhibiting the property of the main charge carrier being electrons. In other words since the main charge carrier is electrons the intermediate layer using N type semiconductor particles exhibits properties of efficiently blocking hole injection from the substrate and reduced blocking for electrons from the photosensitive layer.

Preferred metal oxide particles exhibiting an N type semiconductor property preferably include titanium oxide TiO and zinc oxide ZnO of which the titanium oxide is specifically preferred.

Metal oxide particles employ those having a number average primary particle size of 3 to 200 nm and preferably 5 to 100 nm. The number average primary particle size is a Feret direction average diameter obtained in image analysis when N type semiconductor particles are observed by a transmission electron microscope and 1 00 particles are randomly observed as primary particles from images magnified at a factor of 10000. In cases when the number average primary particle size of N type semiconductor particles is less than 3.0 nm it becomes difficult to disperse the N type semiconductor particles in a binder constituting an intermediate layer and the particles are easily aggregated so that the aggregated particles act as a charge trap making it easy to cause a transfer memory.

When the number average primary particle size is more than 200 nm N type semiconductor particles cause unevenness on the intermediate layer surface tendering to cause non uniformity of dot images via such unevenness. Further when the number average primary particle size is larger than 200 nm N type semiconductor particles easily precipitate in the dispersion often causing deterioration of dot images.

Crystal forms of titanium oxide particles include for example an anatase type a rutile type a brookite type and an amorphous type. Of these rutile type or anatase type titanium oxide particles effectively enhance rectification of a charge passing the intermediate layer. Thus mobility of electrons is enhanced to stabilize the charge potential and increase of residual potential is suppressed contributing to high density dot image formation whereby most preferably used in the present invention.

Metal oxide particles are preferably those which were previously surface treated with a polymer containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit. A polymers containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit and having a molecular weight of 1000 to 20000 effectuates enhanced surface treatment resulting in enhanced rectifying capability of N type semiconductor particles. Accordingly the use of such metal oxide particles prevents occurrence of black spotting and is effective in optimal reproduction of dot images.

The polymer containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit is preferably a copolymer containing a structural unit of HSi CH O and other structural unit other siloxane units . Of other siloxane units a dimethylsiloxane unit a methylethylsiloxane unit a methylphenylsiloxane unit or diethylsiloxane unit is preferred and a dimethylsiloxane unit is specifically preferred. The content of methyl hydrogen siloxane in a copolymer is preferably 10 to 99 mol and more preferably 20 to 90 mol .

A methyl hydrogen siloxane copolymer may be any one of a random copolymer a block copolymer and a graft copolymer but a random copolymer or a block copolymer is preferred. The copolymer may be comprised of a single component or two or more components in addition to methyl hydrogen siloxane.

Other than the foregoing metal oxide particles a coating solution to form the intermediate layer used in the invention is composed of a binder resin a dispersing solvent and the like.

The volume of metal oxide particles used in the intermediate layer is preferably 1.0 to 2.0 times that of the binder resin of the intermediate layer. Such a high density of metal oxide particles in the intermediate layer results in enhanced rectification and even when the layer thickness is increased neither an increase of residual potential nor spotting occur and black spots are effectively prevented thereby forming an electrophotographic photoreceptor exhibiting little potential variation and capable of forming superior halftone images. The intermediate layer contains metal oxide particles preferably in an amount of 100 to 200 parts by volume.

On the other hand as a binder resin to disperse the metal oxide particles and to form a layer structure of the intermediate layer for example a polyamide resin an alkyd resin or a resol type phenol resin is preferable in order to obtain excellent dispersibility of the metal oxide particles. Of these an alcohol soluble polyamide resin is preferable as a polyamide resin. As a binder resin used for the intermediate layer in the electrophotographic photoreceptor a resin exhibiting excellent solvent solubility is desired to form an intermediate layer having a uniform thickness. As such an alcohol soluble polyamide resin known is a copolymerized polyamide resin or a methoxy methylated polyimide resin composed of a chemical structure having not so many carbon chains between amide bonds such as 6 nylon but the following polyamides other than these may also be preferably used.

Further the above described polyamide resin preferably has a number average molecular weight of 5 000 80 000 and more preferably has a number average molecular weight of 10 000 60 000. In the case of a number average molecular weight of 5 000 or less evenness in thickness of the intermediate layer is degraded whereby the effect of the present invention is not sufficiently produced. On the other hand in the case of a number average molecular weight of at least 80 000 solvent solubility of a resin is degraded and a coagulated resin is easy to be produced in the intermediate layer whereby generation of black spots and degradation of dot images are easy to be produced.

A part of the above described polyamide resin has been commercially available for example under the trade name of VESTAMELT X1010 X4685 or the like produced by Daicel Degussa Ltd. They can be prepared by a commonly known method of synthesizing polyamide but one synthesizing example is described below.

As a solvent to dissolve the above described polyamide resin to prepare a coating solution alcohol having 2 4 carbon atoms such as ethanol n propyl alcohol iso propyl alcohol n butanol t butanol sec butanol or the like is preferable in view of solubility of polyamide and coatability of the coating solution. The solvent in the total solvent has a content of 30 100 by mass preferably has a content of 40 100 by mass and more preferably has a content of 50 100 by mass. Examples of the auxiliary solvent to produce a favorable effect in combination with the foregoing solvent include methanol benzyl alcohol toluene methylene chloride cyclohexanone tetrahydrofiran and so forth.

The intermediate layer preferably has a thickness of 0.3 10 m. When the intermediate layer has a thickness of less than 0.3 m deterioration of dot image tends to occur. When the intermediate layer has a thickness exceeding 10 m increase in residual potential is easy to be generated whereby deterioration of dot image tends to occur. The intermediate layer more preferably has a thickness of 0.5 5 m.

It is also preferable that the intermediate layer is substantially an insulating layer. Herein the insulating layer means a layer having a volume resistance of at least 1 10 cm. The intermediate layer as well as the protective layer preferably has a volume resistance of 1 10 1 10 cm more preferably has a volume resistance of 1 10 1 10 cm and still more preferably has a volume resistance of 2 10 1 10 cm. The volume resistance can be measured as described below.

In the case of a volume resistance of less than 1 10 cm a charge blocking property of the intermediate layer is lowered generation of black spots is increased and a potential holding property of the photoreceptor is deteriorated whereby no good image quality can be obtained. On the other hand in the case of a volume resistance exceeding 1 10 cm the residual potential tends to be increased in repetitive image formation whereby no good image quality can be obtained.

In the photoreceptor of the present invention a single layer structure namely a layer having both a charge generation function and a charge transport function is provided on an intermediate layer may be employed however more preferably the function of a photosensitive layer is separated to a charge generation layer CGL and a charge transfer layer CTL .

Thus separated constitution can restrain an increase of residual potential along with repeated use and can easily control other electrophotographic characters according to the object. In a negatively charged photoreceptor it is preferred that a charge generation layer CGL is formed on an intermediate later and further thereon a charge transport layer CTL is formed.

The layer arrangement of a separated function negatively charging photoreceptor will be described below.

In the charge generation layer of the present invention a titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having aforementioned X ray diffraction spectrum characteristics is used as a charge generation material CGM . However other material for example a perylene compound such as an azo pigment or a perylene pigment or a polycyclic quinone pigment may be used in combination.

A binder is preferably used as a dispersing medium of CGM in a charge generation layer. A commonly known resin is usable as the binder but examples of the most preferable resin include a formal resin a butyral resin a silicone resin a silicone modified butyral resin and a phenoxy resin.

The ratio of the charge generation material to the resin binder is preferably 20 600 parts by mass and more preferably 50 400 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin. The increase in residual potential caused by repetitive use can be minimized by using such a resin. The charge generation layer preferably has a thickness of 0.3 2 m.

In the present invention the charge transport layer may be a single layer or may be composed of a plurality of charge transport layers. When the charge transport layer is composed of a plurality of charge transport layers preferable is a constitution in which the uppermost charge transport layer preferably contains inorganic particles.

The charge transport layer contains a charge transport material CTM and a binder resin which disperses the CTM and forms a layer. Additives such as the foregoing inorganic particles or an antioxidant forth may be optionally contained as other substances.

Examples of a charge transfer material CTM include the compounds represented by Formula 1 and 2 of the present invention.

These charge transport materials are usually dissolved in an appropriate binder resin to form a layer.

The binder resin usable in charge transport layer CTL may be any of a thermoplastic resin and a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof include resins such as a polystyrene resin an acrylic resin a methacrylic resin a vinyl chloride resin a vinyl acetate resin a polyvinyl butyral resin an epoxy resin a polyurethane resin a phenol resin a polyester resin an alkyd resin a polycarbonate resin a silicone resin a melamine resin and a copolymer resin having at least two of repeating unit structures of the above described resins. Further a polymer organic semiconductor such as poly N vinyl carbazole or the like other than these insulating resins is cited. Of these resins most preferable is a polycarbonate resin exhibiting low water absorption excellent dispersibility of CTM and excellent electrophotographic properties.

The ratio of the charge transport material to the binder is preferably 50 200 parts by mass and more preferably 100 200 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin.

The charge transport layer preferably has a total thickness of 10 25 m. Further the thickness of the charge transport layer which forms a surface layer is preferably 1.0 8.0 m.

Examples of the solvent or the dispersing medium usable for forming an intermediate layer a charge generation layer a charge transport layer and so forth include n butylamine diethylamine ethylenediamine isopropanolamine triethanolamine triethylene diamine N N dimethylformamide acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isopropyl ketone cyclohexanone benzene toluene xylene chloroform dichloromethane 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dichloropropane 1 1 2 trichloroethane 1 1 1 trichloroethane trichloroethylene tetrachloroethane tetrahydrofuran dioxolan dioxane methanol ethanol butanol isopropanol ethyl acetate butyl acetate dimethylsulfoxide methyl cellosolve and so forth. The present invention is not limited thereto but environmental conscious solvents such as tetrahydrofuran methyl ethyl ketone and so forth are preferably used. These solvents may also be used singly or in combination with at least two kinds of mixed solvents.

Next as coating methods to prepare a photoreceptor an immersion coating method a spray coating method and so forth in addition to a slide hopper type coating method are used. For the formation of a surface layer most preferable is a slide hopper type coating method.

Of coating solution supplying type coaters a coating method using a slide hopper type coater is most suitable for use of a coating solution of a low boiling point solvent dispersion. Coating by a circular slide hopper type coater as described in detail in JP A 58 189061 is preferred for a cylindrical photoreceptor.

In the coating method employing a circular slide hopper type coater the end of the slide surface and the substrate are disposed at a gap approximately from 2 m to 2 mm so that coating is performed without damaging the substrate where even in the case of multiple layer formation differing in kinds of layers coating is feasible without damaging the coated layer. Further even in multiple layer formation differing in the nature of layers but soluble in an identical solvent residence time in the solvent is much shorter than a dip coating method so that coating is performed without eluting a lower layer component into an upper layer or to a coating bath whereby the dispersibility of the inorganic particles is not deteriorated.

The photoreceptor of the present invention preferably contains an antioxidant in its surface layer in order to prevent image blurring. The surface layer is easily oxidized by an active gas such as NOor ozone produced when electrostatically charging the photoreceptor whereby image blurring tends to occur. However such image blurring can be prevented by co existing an antioxidant.

Such an antioxidant is a substance which exhibits a property of preventing or inhibiting the adverse action of oxygen under conditions such as light heat or discharge with respect to an auto oxidative material typically existing in the interior or on the surface of the photoreceptor.

This applied voltage is for example in the range of 100 V to 2 kV.

During the primary transfer process of transferring the first to the third color toner image from photoreceptor to intermediate transfer member secondary transfer roller and intermediate transfer member cleaning device can be separated from intermediate transfer member .

The transfer of the superimposed color toner image transferred onto belt shaped intermediate transfer member on to transfer material P which is the second image supporting body is done when secondary transfer roller is in contact with the belt of intermediate transfer member and transfer material P is fed from corresponding sheet feeding resist roller via the transfer sheet guide to the contacting nip between secondary transfer roller and intermediate transfer member at a specific timing. The secondary transfer bias voltage is applied from the bias power supply to secondary image transfer roller . Because of this secondary transfer bias voltage the superimposed color toner image is transferred secondary transfer from intermediate transfer member to transfer material P which is the second image supporting body. Transfer material P which has received the transfer of the toner image is guided to fixing device and is heated and fixed there.
