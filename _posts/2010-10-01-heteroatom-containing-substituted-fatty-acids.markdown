Nitric oxide NO is an endogenously generated lipophilic signaling molecule that has been implicated in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis modulation of oxygen radical reactions inflammatory cell function post translational protein modification and regulation of gene expression. In addition nitric oxide derived species display separate and unique pharmacological properties specifically can mediate oxidation and nitration of biomolecules such as for example unsaturated fatty acids.

Various reactions yield products capable of concerted oxidation nitrosation and nitration of target molecules. For example nitric oxide may react with superoxide O to yield peroxynitrite ONOO and its conjugate acid peroxynitritrous acid ONOOH the latter of which may undergo homolytic scission to form nitrogen dioxide .NO and hydroxyl radical .OH . In some instances biological conditions may favor the reaction of ONOO with COwhich yields nitrosoperoxycarbonate ONOOCO which rapidly yields .NOand carbonate .C radicals via homolysis or rearrangement to NO and CO. During inflammation neutrophil myeloperoxidase and heme proteins such as myoglobin and cytochrome c catalyze HO dependent oxidation of nitrite NO to . NOresulting in biomolecule oxidation and nitration that is influenced by the spatial distribution of catalytic heme proteins. The reaction of .NO with Ocan also produce products that can be substrates or reactants for nitrosation and nitration. For example the small molecular radius uncharged nature and lipophilicity of .NO and Ofacilitate concentration of these species in biological membranes in a process referred to as the molecular lens effect. The increase in concentration induced by .NO and Osolvation in hydrophobic cell compartments accelerates the normally slow reaction of .NO with Oto yield NOand NO. Finally environmental sources also yield .NOas a product of photochemical air pollution and tobacco smoke.

Nitration of fatty acids by .NOcan occur through several methods. For example during both basal cell signaling and tissue inflammatory conditions .NOcan react with membrane and lipoprotein lipids. In both in vivo and in vitro systems .NOhas been shown to initiate radical chain auto oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids via hydrogen abstraction from the bis allylic carbon to form nitrous acid and a resonance stabilized bis allylic radical. Depending on the radical environment the lipid radical species can react with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical which can react further to form lipid hydroperoxides then oxidized lipids. During inflammation or ischemia when Olevels are lower lipid radicals can react to an even greater extent with .NOto generate multiple nitration products including singly nitrated nitrohydroxy and dinitro fatty acid adducts. These products can be generated via hydrogen abstraction direct addition of .NOacross the double bond or both and in some cases such reactions may be followed by further reactions of the intermediate products that are formed. Hydrogen abstraction causes a rearrangement of the double bonds to form a conjugated diene however the addition of .NOmaintains a methylene interrupted diene configuration to yield singly nitrated polyunsaturated fatty acids. This arrangement is similar to nitration products generated by the nitronium ion NO which can be produced by ONOO reaction with heme proteins or via secondary products of COreaction with ONOO.

The reaction of polyunsaturated fatty acids with acidified nitrite HNO can generate a complex mixture of products similar to those formed by direct reaction with .NO including the formation of singly nitrated products that maintain the bis allylic bond arrangement. The acidification of NO can create a labile species HNO which is in equilibrium with secondary products including NO .NO and .NO all of which can participate in nitration reactions. The relevance of this pathway as a mechanism of fatty acid nitration is exemplified by physiological and pathological conditions wherein NO is exposed to low pH e.g. 

Nitrated linoleic acid LNO has been shown to display robust cell signaling activities that are generally anti inflammatory in nature. Synthetic LNOcan inhibit human platelet function via cAMP dependent mechanisms and inhibits neutrophil O generation calcium influx elastase release CD11b expression and degranulation via non cAMP non cGMP dependent mechanisms. LNOmay also induce vessel relaxation in part via cGMP dependent mechanisms. In aggregate these data derived from a synthetic fatty acid infer that nitro derivatives of fatty acids NO FA represent a novel class of lipid derived signaling mediators. To date a gap in the clinical detection and structural characterization of nitrated fatty acids has limited defining NO FA derivatives as biologically relevant lipid signaling mediators that converge .NO and oxygenated lipid signaling pathways.

Embodiments of the invention are generally directed to activated fatty acids and in particular activated saturated or unsaturated fatty acids having at least one heteroatom interrupting the aliphatic chain of the fatty acid. As used herein an activated fatty acid refers to a fatty acid having at least one electron withdrawing group covalently bound to a carbon of the saturated or unsaturated aliphatic chain of a fatty acid. Such activated fatty acids may be substituted by any number of electron withdrawing groups at any number of positions on the hydrocarbon chain and such electron withdrawing groups may or may not be associated with a carbon carbon double bond of an unsaturated fatty acid a heteroatom or a combination thereof. In various embodiments at least one heteroatom of an activated fatty acid may be positioned adjacent to a carbon having an attached electron withdrawing group or at least one carbon carbon double bond may be associated with an electron withdrawing group. For example in some embodiments the activated fatty acids may include one or more heteroatoms on a saturated aliphatic chain and an electron withdrawing group may be associated with a carbon adjacent to at least one of the one or more heteroatoms. In other embodiments the activated fatty acid may include one or more heteroatoms and or one or more double bonds and an electron withdrawing group may be associated with either a carbon adjacent to at least one of the one or more heteroatoms or at least one of the one or more double bonds or both. Thus in some embodiment an activated fatty acid may have one electron withdrawing group and in other embodiments an activated fatty acid may be substituted with multiple electron withdrawing groups at multiple positions along the hydrocarbon chain and adjacent to any combination of heteroatoms and or double bonds.

In such embodiments the electron withdrawing group may be positioned on a carbon directly adjacent to a heteroatom to form an electron withdrawing heteroatom or a carbon directly attached to a double bond of the activated fatty acid forming an electron withdrawing vinyl group. The electron withdrawing group of such electron withdrawing heteroatoms or electron withdrawing vinyl groups may be on either side of the heteroatom or double bond such that the electron withdrawing group may be in either cis or trans configuration at a double bond or in either R or S absolute stereochemistry at an spchiral stereogenic center.

In various embodiments the heteroatom of an electron withdrawing heteroatoms may be any heteroatom known in the art. For example the heteroatom of some embodiments may be an oxygen a sulfur or a nitrogen and in particular embodiments each heteroatom may be a sulfur or an oxygen. In still other embodiments the heteroatom may be a sulfinyl i.e. S O . The heteroatom containing activated fatty acids encompassed by embodiments may have one or more heteroatoms at any position along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and as such may have one or more electron withdrawing heteroatoms at any position along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. In other embodiments heteroatom containing fatty acids with 3 4 5 6 or more heteroatoms can have an electron withdrawing group on either carbon adjacent to any one heteroatom or a combination of heteroatoms or all of the heteroatoms. Thus embodiments include all possible permutations of positions and electron withdrawing groups available for each heteroatom containing fatty acid.

For example in some exemplary embodiments an activated 18 carbon fatty acid may have a heteroatom replacing the 10 C 9 carbon i.e. E 9 pentylthio dodecanoic acid or E 9 pentyloxy dodecannoic acid and an electron withdrawing group may be positioned at C 8 or C 10 or both. In other embodiments an activated 18 carbon fatty acid may have heteroatoms replacing the 6 C 12 carbon and the 10 C 9 carbon to provide for example 9 2 pentylthio ethylthio nonanoic acid 9 2 pentyloxy ethyloxy nonanoic acid 9 2 pentyloxy ethylthio nonanoic acid 9 2 pentylthio ethyloxy nonanoic acid and the like and an electron withdrawing group may be positioned at any one or all of C 8 C 10 C 11 C 13 or combinations thereof. In yet other embodiments an oleic acid may be couple to a thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid derivatives of oleic acid. For example embodiments include 3 8 octylthio octylthio propanoic acid 3 8 octyloxy octylthio propanoic acid 3 8 octylthio octyloxy propanoic acid 3 8 octylthio octylsulfinyl propanoic acid and the like where a heteroatom replaces C 9 of an 18 carbon acid and an thiopropionic acid oxypropionic acid or sulfinylpropionic acid replaces the carboxy terminus. In such embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be positioned at C 1 C 9 C 10 or the 2 position of the propionic acid or combinations thereof. Certain embodiments include 18 carbon fatty acids having two heteroatoms replacing for example C 9 and C 12 having at least one electron withdrawing group at C 8 C 10 C 11 C 13 or combinations there and sill other embodiments 20 or 22 carbon fatty acids having any number of heteroatoms replacing carbons on the aliphatic chains each having at least one electron withdrawing group positioned at a carbon adjacent to the heteroatom. In yet other embodiments the heteroatom containing activated fatty acids described above may be cholesterol fatty acids.

In the case of electron withdrawing vinyl groups fatty acids encompassed by embodiments may have one or more than one electron withdrawing vinyl groups at any carbon on the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and there are several ways that an unsaturated fatty acid can have one electron withdrawing group. For example in some exemplary embodiments an activated oleic acid octadec 12 enoic acid which is an 18 carbon 6 fatty acid with one double bond denoted 18 1 between the 6 C 13 and 7 C 12 carbons may have an electron withdrawing group at either C 13 or C 12. In other exemplary embodiments an activated linoleic acid octadeac 9 12 dienoic acid which is an 18 carbon 6 fatty acid with two double bonds denoted 18 2 between the 6 C 13 and 7 C 12 carbons and the 9 C 10 and 10 C 9 carbons may have an electron withdrawing group at C 9 or C 10 or C 12 or C 13. In still other embodiments an activated linoleic acid may have an electron withdrawing group at either C 9 or C 10 and C 12 or C 13 and in certain embodiments an activated linoleic acid may have electron withdrawing groups at C 9 and C 10 and or C 12 and C 13. In other embodiments double bond containing fatty acids with 3 4 5 6 or more double bonds can have an electron withdrawing group on either carbon of any one double bond or combination of double bonds or all of the double bonds. Thus embodiments include all possible permutations of positions and electron withdrawing groups available for each heteroatom containing fatty acid.

In analogy to the preceding descriptions of compounds with one electron withdrawing group or two electron withdrawing groups it is also possible to have three four five or more electron withdrawing groups. Following the same logic in the preceding descriptions of compounds with one electron withdrawing group or two electron withdrawing groups multiple heteroatom containing fatty acids with 2 3 4 5 6 or more heteroatoms and polyunsaturated fatty acids with 3 4 5 6 or more double bonds can have multiple electron withdrawing three four five or more as available positions for substitution permit at any of the positions on any of the carbons adjacent to heteroatoms or double bond carbons including all possible permutations of positions and electron withdrawing groups. Additionally in any embodiments such as those described above any number of non electron withdrawing groups may be covalently bound to carbons of the aliphatic chain of the activated fatty acid. For example in some embodiments the activated fatty acids of the invention may include one or more methyl C Calkyl alkenyl or alkynyl or amino covalently attached to one or more carbons of the aliphatic chain of an activated fatty acid.

In particular embodiments an activated fatty acid may have combinations of heteroatoms and double bonds. Thus embodiments of the invention encompass activated fatty acids having one or more heteroatoms and one or more carbon carbon doubles and one or more electron withdrawing groups at a carbon adjacent to a heteroatom or associated with a carbon of the carbon carbon double bond or combinations thereof. For example in some exemplary embodiments an oleic acid may have a heteroatom at the 9carbon C 10 and a double bond at the 6carbon C 12 i.e. 9 oct 2 enylthio nonanoic acid or 9 oct 2 enyloxy nonanoic acid or a heteroatom at the 6carbon C 12 and a double bond 9carbon C 10 i.e. 12 pentylthio dodec 9 enoic acid or 12 pentyloxy dodec 9 enoic acid and an electron with drawing group may be positioned on either carbon adjacent to the heteroatom and or either carbon of the carbon carbon double bond both carbons adjacent to the heteroatom and or both carbons of the carbon carbon double bond or any combination thereof. Similarly in other embodiments multiple heteroatom and double bond containing fatty acids with 2 3 4 5 6 or more heteroatoms and 2 3 4 5 6 or more double bonds can have multiple electron withdrawing three four five or more as available positions for substitution permit at any of the positions on any of the carbons adjacent to heteroatoms or double bond carbons including all possible permutations of positions and electron withdrawing groups. In still other embodiments an activated fatty acid may have one heteroatom and 2 3 4 5 6 or more double bonds and in still further embodiments an activated fatty acid may have one double bond and 2 3 4 5 6 or more heteroatoms so long as at least one heteroatom is an electron withdrawing heteroatom or double bond at least one double bond is an electron withdrawing vinyl group.

In certain embodiments a heteroatom of the activated fatty acid may be located at within for example the first 1 2 3 or 4 carbons from the carboxy terminus of the fatty acid to produce a carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid derivatives of the activated fatty acid. For example in some embodiments a 18 carbon or any length aliphatic hydrocarbon chain may be associated with a mercaptoacetic acid or hydroxyacetic acid to produce an octadecylthioacetic acid or an octadecyloxyacetic acid and an electron withdrawing group may be associated with one or both of the carbons adjacent to the heteroatom. In other embodiments the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain may include one or more double bond and in certain embodiments at least one of these double bonds may include an electron withdrawing group associated with one or both carbons of the double bonds to produce an electron withdrawing vinyl group. In still other embodiments the aliphatic carbon chain may include one or more additional heteroatoms and in some embodiments at least one of the additional heteroatoms may be an electron withdrawing heteroatom. In yet other embodiments the aliphatic chain may include one or more double bonds and one or more additional heteroatoms and in some embodiments any one or any combination of the double bonds or additional heteroatoms may be an electron withdrawing vinyl group or an electron withdrawing heteroatom.

In particular embodiments the heteroatom associated with the carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid may not include an associated electron withdrawing group and therefore the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain associated with the thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid should include at least one electron withdrawing vinyl group or at least one electron withdrawing heteroatom. For example in some embodiments an octadecylthioacetic acid or an octadecyloxyacetic acid may have one or more double bond included within the 18 carbon aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and at least one of these double bonds may be an electron withdrawing vinyl group. In other embodiments an octadecylthioacetic acid or an octadecyloxyacetic acid may have one or more additional heteroatoms included within the 18 carbon aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and at least one of these additional heteroatoms may be an electron withdrawing heteroatom. In still other embodiments an octadecylthioacetic acid or an octadecyloxyacetic acid may have one or more double bond and one or more additional heteroatom included within the 18 carbon aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and at least one of these double bonds or heteroatoms may be an electron withdrawing vinyl group or an electron withdrawing heteroatom. As indicated above numerous permutations of such compounds encompassing various combinations of double bonds heteroatoms electron withdrawing vinyl groups electron withdrawing heteroatoms associated with aliphatic chains of various lengths can be envisioned based on these exemplary embodiments and are encompassed by the invention.

For example in some exemplary embodiments an activated 18 carbon fatty acid i.e. oleic acid may have a heteroatom replacing the 6carbon C 12 on the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and a double bond at the 10 C 9 carbon i.e. E 12 pentylthio dodec 9 enoic acid or E 12 pentyloxy dodec 9 enoic acid and an electron withdrawing group positioned at C 7 C 8 C 9 C 10 C 11 or C 13 or combinations thereof. In other embodiments an oleic acid may have heteroatoms replacing the 6 C 12 carbon and the carbon 1 2 3 or 4 and a double bond at the 10 C 9 carbon to provide for example E 3 8 pentylthio oct 5 enylthio propanoic acid E 3 8 pentyloxy oct 5 enyloxy propanoic acid E 3 8 pentylthio oct 5 enyloxy propanoic acid E 3 8 pentyloxy oct 5 enylthio propanoic acid and the like and an electron withdrawing group may be positioned at any one or all of C 8 C 10 C 11 C 7 C 13 C 1 or C 2. In yet other embodiments an oleic acid may be couple to a thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid derivatives of oleic acid. For example embodiments include E 2 11 pentylthio undec 8 enylthio acetic acid and E 2 11 pentyloxy undec 8 enylthio acetic acid where a heteroatom replaces C 12 of an oleic acid with a carbon carbon double bond at C 9 and an thioacetic acid replaces the carboxy terminus. In such embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be positioned at C 7 C 8 C 9 C 10 C 11 or C 13 or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments any of the oleic acids described above having at least one heteroatom may be cholesterol oleic acids.

Still other embodiments include linoleic acid derivatives having at least one heteroatom or gamma linoleic acid derivatives having at least one heteroatom and the heteroatoms and electron withdrawing groups may be arranged as described for oleic acid. For example embodiments include 9E 12E 14 propylthio tetradeca 9 12 dienoic acid 9E 12E 14 propyloxy tetradeca 9 12 dienoic acid 6 2E 5E undeca 2 5 dienylthio hexanoic acid E 10 E hept 1 enylthio dec 9 enoic acid E 10 E hept 1 enyloxy dec 9 enoic acid 6 2E 5E undeca 2 5 dienyloxy hexanoic acid and 6 2E 5E 7 propylthio hepta 2 5 dienylthio hexanoic acid each having electron withdrawing groups at least one carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or the carbon adjacent to the carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or a carbon adjacent to a heteroatom and combinations thereof. Other exemplary embodiments include gamma linoleic acids 6E 9E 12E 14 propylthio tetradeca 6 9 12 trienoic acid 6E 9E 12E 14 propyloxy tetradeca 6 9 12 trienoic acid 6E 9E 10 E hept 1 enylthio deca 6 9 dienoic acid 6E 9E 10 E hept 1 enyloxy deca 6 9 dienoic acid 2 3E 6E 9E pentadeca 3 6 9 trienylthio acetic acid 2 3E 6E 9E pentadeca 3 6 9 trienyloxy acetic acid 2 3E 6E 9E 1 propylthio undeca 3 6 9 trienylthio acetic acid 2 3E 6E 9E 1 propyloxy undeca 3 6 9 trienyloxy acetic acid 2 3E 6E 9E 11 propyloxy undeca 3 6 9 trienylthio acetic acid and the like each having electron withdrawing groups at least one carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or the carbon adjacent to the carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or a carbon adjacent to a heteroatom and combinations thereof. In yet other embodiments linoleic acid and gamma linoleic acids may have a heteroatom that was introduced by coupling linoleic acid or gamma linoleic acids to a thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid. For example embodiments include 3 8E 11E 13 propylthio trideca 8 11 dienylthio propanoic acid 3 8E 11E 13 propyloxy trideca 8 11 dienylthio propanoic acid 3 5E 8E 11E 13 propylthio trideca 5 8 11 trienylthio propanoic acid 3 5E 8E 11E 13 propyloxy trideca 5 8 11 trienylthio propanoic acid 3 5E 8E 11E 13 propylthio trideca 5 8 11 trienylsulfinyl propanoic acid 3 5E 8E 11E 13 propyloxy trideca 5 8 11 trienylsulfinyl propanoic acid and the like each having electron withdrawing groups at least one carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or the carbon adjacent to the carbon of a carbon carbon double bond or a carbon adjacent to a heteroatom and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments any of the linoleic acids and gamma linoleic acids described above having at least one heteroatom may be cholesterol oleic acids.

Further embodiments include arachidonic acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acids having at least one heteroatom replacing a carbon of the aliphatic chain and still further embodiments include arachidonic acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acids that have been coupled to a thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid to introduce a heteroatom.

While the exemplary compounds described above show double bonds in the E conformation embodiments of the invention encompass activated fatty acids having double bonds in the Z conformation or in any combination of E and Z conformations.

The term electron withdrawing group is recognized in the art and denotes the tendency of a substituent to attract valence electrons from neighboring atoms i.e. the substituent is electronegative with respect to neighboring atoms. A quantification of the level of electron withdrawing capability is given by the Hammett sigma constant see e.g. J. March Advanced Organic Chemistry McGraw Hill Book Company New York 1977 edition pp. 251 259 . The Hammett constant values are generally negative for electron donating groups and positive for electron withdrawing groups. For example the Hammet constant for para substituted NH P is about 0.7 and the P for a nitro group is about 0.8.

Embodiments of the invention encompass any known electron withdrawing group. For example electron withdrawing groups may include but are not limited to aldehyde COH acyl COR carbonyl CO carboxylic acid COOH ester COOR halides Cl F Br etc. fluoromethyl CF cyano CN sulfonyl SO sulfone SOR sulfonic acid SOH 1 2 and 3 ammonium NR and nitro NO where each R may independently be hydrogen methyl or Cto Calkyl alkenyl or alkynyl. In some embodiments the electron withdrawing group may be a strong electron withdrawing group having a of at least about 0.2 and in certain embodiments the electron withdrawing group may form a dipole. For example in particular embodiments the electron withdrawing group may be a nitro ammonium or sulfonyl. In other embodiments the activated fatty acids of the invention may be additionally substituted by non electron withdrawing groups or electron donating groups including for example alcohol OH reverse ester OOCR alkyl alkenyl alkynyl 1 and 2 amines NR nitrate ONO nitrito ONO and the like.

The fatty acids of embodiments may be any unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid known in the art. The term fatty acid describes aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Various embodiments include activated fatty acids having an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain identical or similar to identified naturally occurring fatty acids. For example aliphatic hydrocarbon chains of known naturally occurring fatty acids are generally unbranched and contain an even number of from about 4 to about 24 carbons and others include fatty acids having from 12 to 18 carbons in the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. In still other embodiments fatty acids may have greater than 24 carbons in the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Embodiments of the invention encompass such naturally occurring fatty acids as well as naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids which may contain an odd number of carbons and or a naturally or non naturally occurring linker. Thus some embodiments of the invention include fatty acids having an odd number of carbons of for example from 5 to 23 carbons and in other embodiments from 11 to 17 carbons. In yet other embodiments the fatty acids of embodiments may have greater than 23 carbons. The naturally and naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids of the invention may also be branched at one or more location along the hydrocarbon chain and in various embodiments each branch may include an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain of from 1 to 24 carbons 2 to 20 carbons or 4 to 18 carbons wherein each branch may have an even or odd number of carbons.

The aliphatic hydrocarbon chain of fatty acids of various embodiments may be unsaturated or polyunsaturated. The term unsaturated refers to a fatty acid having a aliphatic hydrocarbon chain that includes at least one double bond and or substituent. In contrast a saturated hydrocarbon chain does not include any double bonds or substituents. Thus each carbon of the hydrocarbon chain is saturated and has the maximum number of hydrogens. Polyunsaturated generally refers to fatty acids having hydrocarbon chains with more than one double bond. The double bonds of the unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids of various embodiments may be at any location along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and may be in either cis or trans configuration. The term cis refers to a double bond in which carbons adjacent to the double bond are on the same side and the term trans refers to a double bond in which carbons adjacent to the double bond are on opposite sides. Typically cis is the same as Z and trans is the same as E but sometimes the IUPAC rules for naming compounds will give the opposite of this which is the typical case in nitroalkenes. For example a nitroalkene can have the two carbon groups cis but the two groups that take priority for the naming of compounds a nitro group on one carbon of the alkene and a carbon group on the other carbon of the alkene are on opposite sides and thus are E. Therefore the nitroalkene analog of a cis double bond is actually an E nitroalkene. Similarly the nitroalkene analog of a trans double bond is actually a Z nitroalkene. Without wishing to be bound by theory double bonds in cis configuration along the carbon chain cis carbon chain but E nitroalkene may induce a bend in the hydrocarbon chain. Double bonds in trans configuration along the carbon chain trans carbon chain but Z nitroalkene may not cause the hydrocarbon chain to bend. Embodiments of the invention may include activated fatty acids having double bonds in either cis or trans configuration and encompass compositions that may include combinations of cis and trans containing activated fatty acids and regioisomers of the activated fatty acids.

Many unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been identified and are known to be naturally occurring. Such unsaturated or polyunsaturated naturally occurring fatty acids generally include an even number of carbons in their aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. For example a naturally occurring unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acid may have 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 and so on carbons and may include omega 3 5 6 7 9 fatty acids and the like. Any such fatty acid may be useful in embodiments of the invention. The symbol is used to refer to the terminal methyl carbon of the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. The placement of the double bond of the X fatty acid is the carbon carbon bond X number of carbons from the carbon. For example an 6 fatty acid has a double bond between the 6and 7carbons counting backward from the carbon and an 3 fatty acid has a double bond between the 3and 4carbons counting backward from the w carbon. Various embodiments of the invention include nitrated 3 fatty acids including but not limited to linolenic acid alpha linolenic acid eicosapentanoic acid docosapentaenoic acid docosahexanoic acid and stearidonic acid nitrated 5 fatty acids including but not limited to myristoleic acid nitrated 6 fatty acids including but not limited to linoleic acid gamma linoleic acid dihomo gamma linoleic acid and arachidonic acid nitrated 7 fatty acids including but not limited to palmitoleic acid and nitrated 9 fatty acids including but not limited to oleic acid and erucic acid. Of course the fatty acids of the invention may also be referred to using IUPAC nomenclature in which the placement of the double bond is determined by counting from the carbon of the carboxylic acid and C X denotes the carbon in aliphatic hydrocarbons using IUPAC nomenclature wherein X is the number of the carbon counting from the carboxylic acid. Embodiments of the invention also include synthetic equivalents to naturally occurring fatty acids and derivatives thereof.

In some embodiments the naturally occurring fatty acids described above may be modified to include a heteroatom. For example a naturally occurring 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 and so on carbon fatty acid or 3 5 6 7 9 fatty acids and the like may be coupled to a thio or oxy carbonate acetic acid propionic acid or butanoic acid. Techniques for preparing such modified fatty acids are known in the art and any such method may be used.

Other embodiments of the invention include unsaturated or polyunsaturated naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids which may have an odd number of carbons such as for example 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 20 21 and so on. As in naturally occurring fatty acids the one or more double bonds associated with naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids may be at any position along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and the double bonds may be in either cis or trans configuration. In yet other embodiments the naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids may include one or more linker groups which interrupt the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. For example in some embodiments activated fatty acids may have one or more non carbon carbon linkage such as for example ester ether vinyl ether amino imine and the like at any position within the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Similarly in other embodiments activated polyunsaturated naturally or non naturally occurring fatty acids may have one or more heteroatoms at any position within the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain.

Various embodiments of the invention include unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids that may have a carbon carbon double bond between any two carbons of the aliphatic chain of the fatty acid and any number of carbon carbon double bonds may be present in such polyunsaturated fatty acids. For example in some embodiments polyunsaturated fatty acids may have 2 3 4 5 6 or more carbon carbon double bonds. In such embodiments each of the more than one carbon carbon double bond may individually be in either cis or trans configuration. In some embodiments at least one of the carbon carbon double bonds of a polyunsaturated fatty acid may have an associated electron withdrawing group and in other embodiments more than one of the carbon carbon double bonds of such polyunsaturated fatty acids may have an associated electron withdrawing group. Additionally in such embodiments the electron withdrawing group may be associated with either carbon of the carbon carbon double bond or a carbon directly adjacent to either carbon of the carbon carbon double bond. For example in some embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be attached to the alpha carbon of the carbon carbon double bond and in other embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be associated with the beta carbon of the carbon carbon double bond. In still other embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be associated with the gamma carbon the carbon directly adjacent to and attached to a carbon carbon double bond. In embodiments where a polyunsaturated fatty acid includes two or more carbon carbon double bonds along the aliphatic chain and an electron withdrawing group is associated with any of the two or more carbon carbon double bonds or each of the two or more of the carbon carbon double bonds each electron withdrawing group may be attached to any carbon associated with each individual carbon carbon double bonds. For example in some embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be associated with each of the double bonds with the electron group attached to either the carbon the beta carbon or the gamma carbon of each double bond. In other embodiments some of the double bonds can have an attached electron withdrawing group and some of the double bonds will not have attached electron withdrawing groups and those double bonds that do have attached electron withdrawing groups can have electron withdrawing groups attached at either the carbon the beta carbon or the gamma carbon of each double bond. Similarly in embodiments in which the activated fatty acid includes a heteroatom an electron withdrawing group may be attached to either of the adjacent carbon atoms or within at least one carbon of the carbon immediately adjacent to the heteroatom.

In particular embodiments an unsaturated fatty acid having at least one electron withdrawing group may be a conjugated fatty acid. In such embodiments two carbon carbon double bonds in an aliphatic chain are adjacent to one another such that there is no methylene group between them. Such conjugated compounds are commonly called 1 3 dienes or conjugated fatty acids. Such 1 3 dienes may include one or more electron withdrawing groups at any of 6 positions at the 1 2 3 and or 4 positions of the 1 3 dienes and at the two carbons adjacent to the diene at the 0 and 5 positions in relation to the 1 2 3 4 method of identifying carbons in a 1 3 diene . For example one associated electron withdrawing group may be attached to any of the 6 positions identified above that is to either the 1 2 3 or 4 positions on the diene or to either of the carbons adjacent to the 1 3 diene at the 0 or 5 positions as described above . In additional embodiments two associated electron withdrawing groups could be attached to any two of the six possible positions three associated electron withdrawing groups could be attached to any two of the six possible positions four associated electron withdrawing groups could be attached to any two of the six possible positions five associated electron withdrawing groups could be attached to any two of the six possible positions and six associated electron withdrawing groups could be attached to any two of the six possible positions. In summary any configuration of electron withdrawing groups attached to any of the six positions described above in a 1 3 diene are encompassed by embodiments of the invention.

In certain embodiments the activated fatty acids of the invention may undergo an isomerization following preparation such that either the cis trans configuration of the double bond the location of the double bond in the carbon chain or both may change. For example in some embodiments a activated fatty acid may be prepared with a carbon carbon double bond of having an electron withdrawing group attached to a gamma carbon of a carbon carbon double bond. Following preparation the carbon carbon double bond may undergo an isomerization such that the electron withdrawing group is now conjugated with the carbon carbon double bond after isomerization. Such isomerizations may occur spontaneously at any time following preparation and may result in a composition which may have initially been prepared as including a single species of activated fatty acid that subsequently includes a combination of isomers of the first prepared activated fatty acid originally produced. In other embodiments an activated fatty acid may be prepared having an electron withdrawing group attached to a gamma carbon of a carbon carbon double bond and this carbon carbon double bond may undergo an isomerization following administration such that an activated fatty acid is produced having the electron withdrawing group is conjugated with the carbon carbon double bond.

In still other embodiments the carboxy terminal end of the activated fatty acid may be modified. For example in some embodiments the fatty acid may include a glycerol associated with the carboxy terminal end of the fatty acid to create a glycerolipid and such glycerolipids may be mono di or tri glycerides wherein at least one of the fatty acids of a di or tri glyceride may be an activated fatty acid and any remaining fatty acids may be a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid. Similarly in other embodiments a carbohydrate may be associated with the carboxy terminal end of an activated fatty acid to form a glycolipid. In such embodiments any carbohydrate known in the art may be a carbohydrate moiety of a glycolipid including but not limited to galactose and glucose. In yet other embodiments a carbohydrate may be associated with a glyceride which is associated with the carboxy terminal end of an activated fatty acid to form a glycero glycolipid which may have one or two activated fatty acids associated with the glycero portion of the glycero glycolipid and in embodiments in which only one activated fatty acid is associated with the glycero glycolipid the remaining position on the glycerol may include a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid or hydrogen alkyl or a functional group such as for example alcohol amine phosphate phosphonic acid thiol sulfonic acid and the like. In certain embodiments the carboxy terminal end of the activated fatty acids of the invention may be associated with a phosphate to from a phospholipid. In such embodiments the phosphate may be directly associated with the fatty acid through the carboxy terminus or the phosphate may be associated with a di glyceride wherein one or two activated fatty acids are attached glycerol moiety and in embodiments where only one activated the fatty acid is attached to the glycerol remaining position on the glycerol may include a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid or hydrogen alkyl or a functional group such as for example alcohol amine phosphate phosphonic acid thiol sulfonic acid and the like. In further embodiments the carboxy terminus of the activated fatty acid may be associated with a cholesterol or other sterol moiety. In yet other embodiments the carboxy terminal end may be modified by the covalent attachment of a secondary active agent. In the particular embodiments carboxy terminal modifications including a glycerol may not include a nitro group. Without wishing to be bound by theory modification of the carboxy terminal end of activated fatty acids may enhance partitioning of the activated fatty acid after administration and may also improve resilience of the activated fatty acid by inhibiting beta oxidation in mitochondria following administration.

Activated fatty acids as described in various embodiments of the invention above may be administered to individuals to treat ameliorate and or prevent a number both acute and chronic inflammatory and metabolic conditions. In particular embodiments activated fatty acids may be used to treat acute conditions including general inflammation autoimmune disease autoinflammatory disease arterial stenosis organ transplant rejection and burns and chronic conditions such as chronic lung injury and respiratory distress diabetes hypertension obesity arthritis neurodegenerative disorders and various skin disorders. However in other embodiments activated fatty acids may be used to treat any condition having symptoms including chronic or acute inflammation such as for example arthritis lupus Lyme s disease gout sepsis hyperthermia ulcers enterocolitis osteoporosis viral or bacterial infections cytomegalovirus periodontal disease glomerulonephritis sarcoidosis lung disease lung inflammation fibrosis of the lung asthma acquired respiratory distress syndrome tobacco induced lung disease granuloma formation fibrosis of the liver graft vs. host disease postsurgical inflammation coronary and peripheral vessel restenosis following angioplasty stent placement or bypass graft coronary artery bypass graft CABG acute and chronic leukemia B lymphocyte leukemia neoplastic diseases arteriosclerosis atherosclerosis myocardial inflammation psoriasis immunodeficiency disseminated intravascular coagulation systemic sclerosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multiple sclerosis Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease encephalomyelitis edema inflammatory bowel disease hyper IgE syndrome cancer metastasis or growth adoptive immune therapy reperfusion syndrome radiation burns alopecia and the like.

When administered activated fatty acids may interact with a number of cellular receptors and or proteins that mediate inflammation either by inhibiting or stimulating their activity thereby inhibiting or reducing inflammation. Without wishing to be bound by theory activated fatty acids may modulate important signaling activities including for example neurotransmission gene expression vascular function and inflammatory responses and chemical properties of activated fatty acids that may facilitate these activities include but are not limited to the strong reversible electrophilic nature of the carbon adjacent to the electron withdrawing vinyl group an ability to undergo Nef like acid base reactions to release NO an ability to partition into both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments and a strong affinity for G protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors.

For example in one embodiment activated fatty acids may be administered to mediate cell signaling via multiple G protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors such as but not limited to peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPAR including PPAR PPAR and PPAR . PPAR is a nuclear receptor that is expressed throughout an organism including in monocytes macrophages neutrophils endothelial cells adipocytes epithelial cells hepatocytes mesangial cells vascular smooth muscle cells neuronal cells and when activated induces transcription of a number of target genes. Activation of PPAR has been shown to play various roles in regulating tissue homeostasis including for example increasing insulin sensitivity suppress chronic inflammatory processes reduce circulating free fatty acid levels correct endothelial dysfunction reduce fatty streak formation delay plaque formation limit blood vessel wall thickening and enhance plaque stabilization and regression. The activated fatty acids embodied herein may perform each of these functions associated with PPAR activation.

Moreover activated fatty acids may perform these functions without significantly altering normal cellular process. For example in one embodiment an activated fatty acid may be administered to treat hypertension by lowering blood pressure to normal levels without reducing the blood pressure of the individual below normal levels even if the activated fatty acid is over administered. Thus without wishing to be bound by theory the activated fatty acids of the invention may provide treatment of an individual without the negative affects associated with over administration or over treatment using traditional medications.

Activation of PPAR has been shown to be induced either directly or in part by a locking reaction in which a critical thiol in a highly conserved cysteine Cys 285 of human PPAR which is located in a ligand binding domain of PPAR. Partial activation of PPAR has been shown to occur when relatively high concentrations of known thiol reactive compounds such as 15 deoxy prostaglandin J 15 d PGJ are administered. Without wishing to be bound by theory activated fatty acids may bind to PPAR covalently at the reactive thiol in the ligand binding domain of PPAR. Moreover activated fatty acids may induce a conformational change in PPAR. More specifically activated fatty acid binding may result in the C terminus of the ligand binding domain helix 12 to adopt an active conformation that may promote a beneficial pattern of co repressor release and co activator recruitment. Thus activated fatty acids may enhance PPAR activation and transcription of PPAR regulated genes beyond that of known PPAR activating compounds.

In addition to activation of PPAR activated fatty acid administration may be useful for activating a number of other factors important for cell signaling. For example in one embodiment activated fatty acids may be administered to induce gene expression and tissue activity of heme oxygenase 1 HO 1 which has been shown to mediate adaptive and protective responses during inflammation and activation of an adaptive or protective inflammatory response mediated by HO may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases such as but not limited to atheroscelrosis acute renal failure vascular restinosis transplant rejection and sepsis. In another embodiment activated fatty acids may induce a reversible post translational modification of proteins such as for example glutathione GSH and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH by covalently binding to catalytic cysteines on such proteins. Without wishing to be bound by theory the covelent modification of these proteins by activated fatty acids may increase the hydrophobicity of these proteins inducing translocation of to membranes and suggests a role for redox regulation of enzyme function cell signaling and protein trafficking. In yet another embodiment activated fatty acids may be administered to repress NF B dependent gene expression and endothelial tumor necrosis factor induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules in monocytes and macrophages which results in inhibition of rolling and adhesion during inflammation. Thus activated fatty acids may be useful for treating general inflammation resulting from surgery injury or infection. In a further embodiment activated fatty acids may be administered to limit tissue inflammatory injury and inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by increasing cellular levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 Nrf 2 which may be useful in the treatment of a number of vascular diseases. In some embodiments activated fatty acids may be administered to modify the activity of transient receptor potential TRP channels such as TRPA1 and TRPV1 and may be capable of modifying pain and inflammatory signaling. In other embodiments activated fatty acids may be used to induce heat shock factor HSF proteins and inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPs and in still other embodiments activated fatty acids may be administered to activate mitogen activated protein kinases MAP kinases .

In a still further embodiment activated fatty acids may be useful for ischemic preconditioning. For example nitrated fatty acids produced by mitochondria in cells under ischemic conditions cause a number of physiological changes within the cell that increases cell survival under ischemic conditions. By providing activated fatty acids to an individual similar ischemic preconditioning may be achieved allowing for improved survival of for example cardiac tissue under ischemic conditions or organs being preserved for optimizing viability and function upon transplantation.

The activated fatty acids of the invention can be administered in any conventional manner by any route where they are active. Administration can be systemic or local. For example administration can be but is not limited to parenteral subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal transdermal oral buccal or ocular routes or intravaginally by inhalation by depot injections or by implants. In certain embodiments the administration may be parenteral or intravenous all in the presence or absence of stabilizing additives that favor extended systemic uptake tissue half life and intracellular delivery. Thus modes of administration for the compounds of the present invention either alone or in combination with other pharmaceuticals can be injectable including short acting depot implant and pellet forms injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly . In some embodiments an injectable formulation including an activated fatty acid may be deposited to a site of injury or inflammation such as for example the site of a surgical incision or a site of inflammation due to arthroscopy angioplasty stent placement by pass surgery and so on.

In certain other embodiments the compounds of the invention may be applied locally as a salve or lotion applied directly to an area of inflammation. For example in some embodiments a lotion or salve including activated fatty acids of the invention may be prepared and applied to a burn radiation burn site of dermal disorder edema arthritic joint or the like.

Various embodiments of the invention are also directed to method for administering activated fatty acids. Specific modes of administration may vary and may depend on the indication. The selection of the specific route of administration and the dose regimen may be adjusted or titrated by the clinician according to methods known to the clinician in order to obtain the optimal clinical response. The amount of compound to be administered is that amount which is therapeutically effective. The dosage to be administered will depend on the characteristics of the subject being treated e.g. the particular animal treated age weight health types of concurrent treatment if any and frequency of treatments and can be easily determined by one of skill in the art e.g. by the clinician . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages may be determined with guidance for example from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ninth Edition 1996 Appendix II pp. 1707 1711 or from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Tenth Edition 2001 Appendix II pp. 475 493 both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. With respect to conventional prenylation enzyme inhibitors guidance may be obtained from art recognized dosage amounts as described for example by J. E. Karp et al. Blood 97 11 3361 3369 2001 and A. A. Adjei et al. Cancer Research 60 1871 1877 2000 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In various embodiments an effective amount of an activated fatty acid delivered during each administration cycle may range from about 10 mg m day to about 1000 mg m day. In some embodiments an effective amount may be about 20 mg m day to about 700 mg m day and in others an effective amount may be about 30 mg m day to about 600 mg m day. In particular embodiments an effective amount may be about 50 mg m day about 400 mg m day about 500 mg m day or about 600 mg m day. In yet other embodiments an effective amount of an activated fatty acid may vary as treatment progresses. For example a dosage regimen may be increased or decreased as treatment proceeds through administration cycles or the daily dosage may increase or decrease throughout administration. In additional embodiments greater than 1000 mg m day may be administered because even high doses of activated fatty acid are generally tolerable to the patient and may not produce undesired physiological effects.

In some embodiments the dosage regimen as described above may be combined with a secondary form of treatment or a secondary agent

The activated fatty acids of various embodiments may be prepared by any method known in the art. For example in one embodiment an activated fatty acid may be prepared by 

ii contacting the intermediate resulting from step a with a reagent or reactant that can introduce an electron withdrawing group and

Without wishing to be bound by theory a selenium compound such as for example PhSeBr PhSeCl PhSeOCCF PhSeOH PhSeCN and the like may react with one or more carbon carbon double bond of the unsaturated fatty acid to form a three membered ring intermediate on the fatty acid in a reaction that may be facilitated by the mercuric salt such as for example HgCl Hg NO Hg OAc and the like as depicted in step I of the reaction below 

The source of the electron withdrawing group may be any compound known in the art that is capable of generating an electron withdrawing group that can be incorporated into the activated fatty acid such as for example NaNO AgNO HSOOH and the like. Without wishing to be bound by theory the electron withdrawing group X in the reaction scheme above may become joined to the hydrocarbon chain by displacing for example the bromine that was associated with the selenium compound as depicted in step II of the reaction scheme provided above. It is noted that the electron withdrawing groups may also react directly with the three membered ring episelenonium ion shown in step I at the position where the bromine is shown as attacking. Finally as depicted in step III of the reaction scheme provided above the oxidizing agent forms a reactive selenium oxo functional group which undergo molecular rearrangement and elimination of ZSeOH leading to formation of the electron withdrawing vinyl depicted as a nitro vinyl on the hydrocarbon chain. Z in the reaction scheme above may be any number of groups. For example in certain embodiments Z may be a phenyl group.

In other embodiments an activated fatty acid may be prepared using a modified aldol condensation such as the Henry reaction. A review of the Henry reaction and methods related to the Henry method can be found for example in Frederick A. Luzzio F. A. The Henry reaction recent examples Tetrahedron 2001 57 915 945 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Known variations of the Henry reaction may also be useful in preparing activated fatty acids and all such methods are embodied herein. For example in some embodiments variations of the Henry reaction including but not limited to the Wittig like variation of the Henry reaction the Horner Wadsworth Emmons variation of the Henry reaction and the Peterson olefination variation of the Henry reaction. In such methods double bonds are formed using the assistance of groups temporarily included in the reactants but that do are not included in the product. For example the Wittig reaction uses phosphorus ylides to aid in the condensation reactions with carbonyls and in the dehydration reaction to form alkenes. The Horner Wadsworth Emmons reaction uses phosphonate esters and the Peterson olefination uses silicon reagents for the condensation and dehydration steps. A review of major alkene forming name reactions by reaction of a functionalized reagent with a carbonyl compound including the Wittig reaction Horner Wittig Horner Wadsworth Emmons can be found for example in Peterson Johnson and Julia reactions. Blakemore P. R. The modified Julia olefination alkene synthesis via the condensation of metallated heteroarylalkylsulfones with carbonyl compounds 1 2002 2563 2585 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The Henry nitro aldol reaction is the condensation of a nitroalkane with either an aldehyde or a ketone carbonyl containing compound to form a nitro aldo product with the newly formed beta hydroxynitroalkyl group. Dehydration loss of water from nitro aldol products leads to the formation of nitroalkenes. There are many methods to perform the nitroalkane carbonyl condensation reaction to make nitro aldols and there are many methods for the dehydration reaction to form nitroalkenes. Examples of such methods can be found in for example Woodcock S. R. Marwitz A. J. V. Bruno P. Branchaud B. P. Synthesis of Nitrolipids. All Four Possible Diastereomers of Nitrooleic Acids E and Z 9 and 10 Nitro octadec 9 enoic Acids 2006 8 3931 3934 which provides one regioisomer and usually one of two possible alkene cis trans or Z E diastereomers in high purity and usually in high chemical yield which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entireties.

Enantioselective Henry reactions are also possible and may require the use of one or more catalysts for the reaction and embodiments of the invention include the use of such methods to prepare stereospecific isomers of nitroalkenes. For example Boruwa J. Gogoi N. Saikia P. P. and Barua N.C. Catalytic Asymmetric Henry Reaction 2006 17 3315 3326 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety describes methods for preparing stereospecific isomers of nitoralkenes.

In still other embodiments alkenes olefins may be prepared by metal mediated cross coupling reactions joining together of two molecules to make one new molecule by condensation onto a carbonyl compound. Such methods have not been applied to the formation of nitroalkenes or to the formation of other alkenes with electron withdrawing substituents but such methods could be adapted to the synthesis of alkenes with electron withdrawing substituents. For example named cross coupling reactions such as the Heck Suzuki and Stille coupling along with others may be used to prepare activated fatty acids. Such methods are well known in the art. A review of such reactions of can be found in for example Metal Catalyzed Cross Coupling Reactions de Meijere Armin Diederich Francois eds. Wiley VCH Weinheim 2004. XXII ISBN 10 3 527 30518 1 and ISBN 13 978 3 527 30518 6 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Examples of various embodiments of methods for preparing activated fatty acids may at least include the following steps 

i combining a first component at least including an aliphatic hydrocarbon having an electron withdrawing group at one end with an second component including aliphatic hydrocarbon chain having an aldehyde at one end in the presence of a base to form a first intermediate and

In reaction schemes I and II the variable X represents an electron withdrawing group and can be any electron withdrawing group discussed herein above or known in the art. The variables n and m represent a number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and n and m can be any number. For example the aliphatic hydrocarbon chains of any of the starting compound may be from 2 20 carbons in length. Moreover the position of the double bond and the arrangement of the electron withdrawing group in relation to the double bond may be determined specifically and particular activated fatty acids may be created in high yield. For example an oleic acid may be produced by the reaction of scheme I by combining a first substrate where m is 10 and a second substrate where n is 2.

Any activated fatty acid may be produced using the method presented above and both naturally occurring and naturally or non naturally occurring analogs may be synthesized. For example synthesis of an exemplary nitrated fatty acids may be produced as illustrated in the general synthetic method is shown in III below.

In some embodiments individual Rand Rgroups may contain additional functional groups other than double bonds which may or may not be associated with a carbon carbon double bond either existing before the reaction is carried out or following the reaction illustrated in Scheme III. For example individual Rand Rgroups may include functional groups such as but not limited to alkynes as a part of the chain with the alkyne in the chain alcohols aldehyde carbonyls ketone carbonyls derivatives of carbonyl aldehydes and ketones such as oximes hydrazones and any other carbonyl derivative known in the art amines amines with other groups known in the art attached to the amine thiols thiols with other groups known in the art attached to the thiols any other functional group known in the art either as the simple functional group or the functional group with another chain or group attached to it. Such functional groups may be attached to a carbon in the linear or branched chain. Without wishing to be bound by theory the addition of additional functional groups may alter the targeting and bioavailability of the activated fatty acids of embodiments such that specific cells or targets it within cells can be targeted.

In yet other embodiments molecules may contain more than one carbon chain with two or more carbon chains joined together by a non carbon group and in some embodiments each of the carbon chains can be branched or linear.

In addition to the common non carbon multivalent elements found in organics compounds and shown above oxygen nitrogen sulfur other functional groups known in the art and based on any other non carbon multivalent element may be used in embodiments of the invention. In various embodiments any of the non carbon chains described above could be incorporated into activated fatty acids using the general synthetic approach shown in III above in which the non carbon chains are in R R or both.

Preparation of heteroatom containing activated fatty acids may be carried out using the same methodology as described above for introducing an electron withdrawing group to an unsaturated fatty acid.

In still other embodiments a sulfinylalkanoic acid may be prepared by drying a thioalkanoic acid prepared as described above and maintaining the dried product in an oxygen rich environment for a several days. In such embodiments an electron withdrawing group may be introduced onto the unsaturated or polyunsaturated aliphatic chain by any of the methods provided above either before or after formation of the thioalkanoic acid oxyalkanoic acid or sulfinylalkanoic acid.

Commercially available 9 bromononanol was oxidized using Jones reagent chromium trioxide CrO in concentrated sulfuric acid HSO 67 to form a carboxylic acid protected as an allyl ester 92 yield and was nitrated using the Kornblum method silver nitrate AgNO in diethyl ether EtO to form 9 nitro nonanoic acid allyl ester in an overall yield of 42 . Nitroaldol condensation was then carried out by combining this intermediate with commercially available nonyl aldehyde in the presence of a catalytic amount of 10 mol of DBU to produce hydroxynitro 81 yield as a 1 1 mixture of diastereomers. The hydroxynitroester intermediate was acetylated in acetic anhydride with a catalytic amount of p toluenesulfonic acid to produce a acetoxynitro ester intermediate in high yield and the nitroalkene was generated by from the acetoxynitro ester intermediate by base induced elimination with azeotropic removal of water in 0.5 equivalence of sodium carbonate. The stereoselectively clean E isomer nitroalkene was produced in 84 yield and did not require isomerization or deconjugation of double bonds to form allylic nitroalkanes. A free acid of the produced nitroalkene was accomplished by palladium catalyzed isomerization in the presence of formic acid to produce the free acid E 9 nitro octadec 9 enoic acid in 95 yield. Overall yield from commercially available starting products was 56 . Because of the base sensitivity of nitroalkenes acidic conditions were consistently throughout both reaction and work up were possible.
