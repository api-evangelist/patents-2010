This applications claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 228 229 filed on Jul. 24 2009 and entitled Systems and Methods For Providing a Multi Device Multi Service Platform Via A Client Agent which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Modern day consumers often own multiple electronic devices such as desktops laptops smartphones personal digital assistants cable set top boxes speakers televisions or GPS systems. Given the complex and disparate nature of these devices obtaining full technical support across devices may be cumbersome. Support services are typically dispersed among different providers. Consumers may need to establish separate accounts with various providers or travel to different locations to obtain services for their devices.

Because the service providers reach the consumers through individual avenues and do not communicate with one another they collectively provide fragmented and inefficient services. Each service provider performs its own examination upon devices potentially resulting in repetitive discovery and diagnoses across providers. Further solutions that each service provider learns in the course of their support remain with the individual providers thereby limiting the providers amount of knowledge and rate of learning.

Additionally customers often have limited understanding of services for their devices. Customers typically seek services when a device malfunctions they become dissatisfied with the device s level of performance or they become aware of services through third party avenues e.g. advertisements word of mouth . As continued support for devices is largely customer driven devices may not be optimally maintained.

The solution of the present application provides many types and forms of resources such as products or services to an environment of heterogeneous devices. An agent and centralized service may communicate to deliver an optimum package of resources to a device. Each device may include an agent that collects information important to determining the appropriate resources for the device and understanding the environment the devices are contributing to. The information may be stored and analyzed in a cross device knowledge base and the knowledge base may be consulted to determine resources appropriate for devices. The agent and centralized service may engage in pro active alerting and provisioning of services based on any collected information to minimize the burden of resource procurement on the customer. After delivery of resources the agent and centralized service may also perform updating repairing and healing functions for the resources. Resources may be aggregated into a cohesive platform to be combined and delivered in an optimum manner and resources may also be maintained and monitored to ensure their quality via escalation or remedial action. Devices may be connected to the resources through intelligent routing.

Although the embodiments of the system and methods of are generally described in connection with remote technicians these systems and methods may be used for automated systems and or local labor as well. Furthermore these systems and methods may be used for intelligently and effectively deploying any combination of remote personnel systems and or local labor to deliver or perform a service or delivery a resource. As such the service level attributes and capabilities may correspond to such different types of services providers. For example there may be a database comprising capabilities of onsite personnel. In another example there may be a database comprising capabilities of remote non technical service personnel. In another example there may be a database comprising capabilities of systems such as automated systems. In some embodiments the database s comprise capabilities of any type of service provider described herein such as those corresponding to .

For example the systems and methods of the centralized remote technical support services described herein may also be deployed for local onsite services. In these embodiments the solution uses remote services technology to deliver the most appropriate trained technical resource to resolve the customer needs at the customer s home or location. The innovative application of the centralized technology discussed herein with innovative modification to skills and processes for local onsite service improves and optimizes the amount of cost required to deliver services to the home. Without the use of the technology and processes described herein one or more technicians visits the consumer s home or location for an indeterminate period of time and for additional appointments to be scheduled when the work exceeds either the time or the skill of the one or more technicians.

By using the systems and methods described herein the skills of the technician visiting the home may be redefined or re scoped to be associated with connecting devices and enabling connection of the computers to a network or the Internet. The amount of time to perform these tasks is more deterministic and requires a much more focused set of skills. For example an onsite service home service technician may be dispatched for hour hour or other predetermined time increments to perform a preliminary diagnostics and to setup up the service work to the Intelligent Switch much like the store associate in the consumer outlet scenarios described above. Once the interconnection of the consumer device is complete and the device is hooked up to the Intelligent Switch remote resources from the centralized service may be connected to complete all the necessary installations configurations training and repairs. As such in these embodiments appropriate skilled resources are applied without the need to send additional technicians to the consumer s location. The onsite technician may leave to attend other service calls once the device is hooked up to the Intelligent Switch .

A typical example scenario for a local onsite service is that a consumer may call for help because his or her computer is slow lost connectivity to the Internet experiencing lots of pop ups and or perhaps would like to install some new devices. A technician may be assigned a time frame of 1 3 hours reserved to perform the work. When the technician arrives on site he or she may diagnose the problem and may start with a set of tools to fix the problem and then proceed to hook the computer up to the Internet or verify connectivity to the Internet. Once done the technician may start to install new devices and software onto the computer. Without the use of the centralized remote technical services described herein much of the time spent on site is watching the tools fix the problems as they can take a long time to scan and automatically fix problems. In some cases the technician may run out of time or that there will be aspects of the work that will require another visit by a technician with a different set of skills. With the user of the centralized remote technical services described herein a predetermined amount of time may be set for the technician for an onsite visit such as a 1 hour appointment. In that time period the technician may perform a diagnostics and connect and configure the device to be connected to the Internet Switch and pool of remote technical resources. The onsite technician may go to another place to do the same work another home visit for a predetermined amount of time after leaving the computer connected to the centralized remote technical support service. At that point the computer may be assigned from a queue to a remote technician to perform the desired service based on the onsite technician s diagnostics description of the problem or information submitted to the Intelligent Switch . The remote technician for example may clean and update the software and configuration of the computer and install any new devices. In addition the remote technician may deliver training to the consumer at his home such as live one on one training. If the remote technician performing the service is not the best or appropriate resource to perform the service the connection to the consumer s computer may be transferred electronically and real time to the next appropriate technician with out the need to reschedule an onsite visit.
