title: Decoupled multiple weapon platform
abstract: A Decoupled Elevation, Automatic Drift Correction (DEADCo) Multiple Weapon System is provided for concurrently engaging line-of-sight and indirect-fire weapons against a target. The DEADCo system includes a turret structure, a first cradle and a second cradle. The turret structure is mountable to a vehicle and rotatable in yaw on a turret training drive. The first cradle is mountable to the turret structure. The first cradle has a fire control system, and a first elevation drive rotatable in pitch on which to pivotably mount the line-of-sight weapon. The fire control system relays pointer commands to the first elevation drive. The second cradle is mountable to the turret structure. The second cradle includes a drift correction drive rotatable in yaw and a second elevation drive rotatable in pitch. The fire control system relays the pointer commands to the drift correction and second elevation drives that compensate for drift. The deflection weapon couples to the drift correction and second elevation drives for independent rotations in pitch and yaw.

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 61 276 163 with a filing date of Aug. 30 2009 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to land mobile weapons platforms. In particular this invention relates to a weapons turret that enables concurrent operation of decoupled projectile launchers that operate using separate targeting operations.

Conventional weapon system concepts such as the Up Gunned Weapon Station UGWS on the United States Marine Corps USMC AAVP7A1 amphibious assault vehicle mount weapons that fire munitions of a high velocity low angle also called flat trajectory nature e.g. 0.50 cal M2HB and weapons that fire lower velocity munitions subject to large corrections required for range and deflection of the projectiles e.g. 40 mm MK 19 .

The deflection for low velocity munitions is mainly caused by the drift of the projectile while in free flight. The dynamics of a free flight projectile especially a spin stabilized one induces a motion called drift along the line of travel. This arrangement to employ weapons that fire projectiles that behave very different from each other while in free flight degrades an operator s ability to efficiently sight on a target and engage simultaneously with both weapons.

High velocity flat trajectory weapons such as the .50 caliber M2HB machine gun require a line of sight LOS to the target through which the operator sights the weapon and engages the target by aligning the weapon s gun bore line along the LOS with very small adjustments for drift and compensating for the range by making small elevation adjustments to the weapon. The fired projectiles then fly out to the target along this general LOS to the target.

This enables a sighting and ranging system to be directly coupled to the high velocity flat trajectory weapon. For purposes of this disclosure this is referred to as an LOS weapon that fires an LOS projectile. As the sight is trained and elevated the LOS weapon follows the sight direction adjusting for minor elevation corrections for range to target that can be achieved by the turret.

Weapons that fire low velocity high deflection munitions do not follow the LOS to the target and must employ a combination of large elevation and train adjustments to deliver its projectile onto the target. For purposes of disclosure this type is referred to as a deflection weapon. This motion is of such magnitude for particular weapon types e.g. mortar that were the deflection weapon sighted along the LOS to the target and a round fired the projectile would consistently miss the target to one side due to the drift of the projectile thereby constituting a bias error. An excellent example of this is the 40 mm MK 19 automatic grenade launcher.

The current UGWS weapon system apparatus has the operator utilizing a single sighting system for both weapons which are tied to the same elevation and train drive mechanisms. Due to the vastly different ballistic properties of the ammunition types used the operator must complete a complex series of movements and adjustments in order to range the target and sight both weapons properly.

Because the dissimilar weapons are tied to the same elevation and training drives along with the single sighting system the operator cannot bring both weapons to bear on the target at the same time. Instead the operator must bring the weapons to bear sequentially thus consuming valuable time in combat situations. This reduces overall system effectiveness as half of the weapons suite cannot be used in a specific engagement sequence.

Conventional land mobile weapons platforms yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular the conventional systems do not permit concurrent targeting by weapons firing munitions with vastly different ballistic properties due to their coupled dependency on the turret for directional aiming i.e. for making train adjustments .

Instead various exemplary embodiments provide a Decoupled Elevation Automatic Drift Correction DEADCo Multiple Weapon System for concurrently engaging weapons that fire both high velocity flat trajectory munitions and low velocity high deflection munitions against a target. The DEADCo system includes a turret structure a first cradle and a second cradle both mounted on the turret structure and independent of each other.

The turret structure is mountable to a vehicle and rotatable in yaw on a turret training drive. The first cradle is mountable to the turret structure. The first cradle has a fire control system and a first elevation drive rotatable in pitch on which to pivotably mount the line of sight LOS weapon. The fire control system relays pointer commands to the first elevation drive.

The second cradle is mountable to the turret structure. The second cradle includes a drift correction drive rotatable in yaw and a second elevation drive rotatable in pitch. The fire control system relays the pointer commands to the drift correction and second elevation drives that compensate for drift. The low velocity high deflection weapon couples to the drift correction and second elevation drives for independent rotations in pitch and yaw.

In various exemplary embodiments the fire control system further includes a sighting mechanism for detecting the target a target ranging apparatus for determining range to the target and a computation processor for pointing the LOS weapon.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The purpose of the Decoupled Elevation Automatic Drift Correction DEADCo Multiple Weapon System is to provide a single weapon platform capable of simultaneously utilizing weapons of both high velocity flat trajectory herein called LOS and low velocity high deflection herein called deflection natures. When such weapons are coupled together in a single weapon platform the weapons system operator is at a severe disadvantage in combat as these weapons require different methods of engaging a target at a given range.

The DEADCo Multiple Weapon System allows for two or more dissimilar weapon types to be mounted together into a single weapon system. The concept allows for the single sighting and ranging system to allow for the proper aiming adjustments to be made for all mounted weapons. This enables the system operator to engage a target with all mounted weapons concurrently or even simultaneously.

The key to the concept is twofold. First the weapons are on separate elevation axes each weapon directed with its own drive system. Second the automatic drift correction cradle allows the deflection weapon to be sighted onto the target by automatically correcting for the drift of the projectiles for a given range input.

The fire control system includes three elements the target ranging apparatus the combination day and night time sighting mechanism and the computation processor that computes the gun pointing commands for the LOS weapon based on various stabilization meteorological and ballistic inputs. These commands direct both the elevation drive for the LOS weapon and training drive for the turret . As implied the LOS weapon is stabilized in this manner and the turret can be slewed e.g. trained to track and engage a moving target. The fire control system and LOS weapon can be manually directed by the hand controls .

A deflection weapon is mounted separately to the turret and rests in the automatic drift correction cradle . This cradle contains a combination elevation and train drive mechanism . Upon receipt of a range input via either mechanical or electrical sources from the fire control system the elevation and train drive mechanism moves the cradle to the appropriate elevation and train angles. The cradle automatically trains the deflection weapon to the proper train angle to adjust for deflection of the ammunition type used for a given range while simultaneously elevating the deflection weapon to the appropriate elevation angle based on gun pointing commands from the computation processor in the controller system .

No separate fire control computation of train angle for drift correction is required as a single range input accomplishes this automatically. Thus the deflection weapon can be brought to bear even on a target moving relative to the turret as long as the fire control system is providing range inputs to the automatic drift correction cradle combined with the drive mechanism .

In the event of power loss a manual input mechanism can be used to drive the deflection weapon to the proper elevation and train angles. A manual range indicator is also used in conjunction with the combination and manual drive mechanisms and on the automatic drift correction cradle .

These elements represent a high velocity flat trajectory system having a line of sight from the turret sight to a target . The fire control system emits a range sensing signal to provide a range distance value against which the LOS weapon can aim for fire at the target . The deflection weapon connects to the drift correction cradle and controlled by the drive mechanism . These components represent a large drift correction system that enable the deflection weapon to concurrently launch its weapon against the target by an arc trajectory .

For the large drift correction system the deflection weapon pivotably mounts to a drift correction drive mechanism mounted to the drift correction cradle . The drive mechanism rotates on a vertical axis of rotation to pivot in yaw for drift adjustment. Absent the rotation for drift a projectile launched from the deflection weapon would travel in an uncorrected line of fire whereas drift correction adjusts the line of fire to travel along the proper arc trajectory .

The elevation and train drive mechanism couples to the drift correction drive mechanism along a lateral axis of rotation to pivot in pitch for elevation adjustment of the deflection weapon . The manually operated drive mechanism or hand crank with its reduction gears can provide motive force to manually adjust elevation or azimuth of the drive mechanisms in the event of an electrical power cutoff. The drive mechanism receives target distance information from the fire control system and transfers the information to the range indicator from which the drift correction can be determined. These operations enable both the LOS and deflection weapons and to be independently aimed at the same target without interruption due to coupled aim adjustment mechanisms.

The Advantages of the DEADCo Multiple Weapon System are numerous as compared to current systems that mount both LOS and deflection weapons and . They are as follows 

1 Allows for simultaneous engagement of a target by multiple weapons that are of both high velocity flat trajectory and low velocity high deflection fire in nature directed by a single fire control system comprising of a sighting ranging and adjustment computation components 

2 Simplifies the operator actions by reducing the number of steps required to engage a target especially when switching between the separate weapons and 

4 Allows for a variety of different weapon types to be mounted into a single mount or turret structure while nonetheless enabling continual engagement of a target and

5 Improves the reliability of the turret training drive by reducing the wear and tear on the system by constant drift adjustments for the deflection weapon the automatic drift correction cradle executes that function instead.

The Decoupled Elevation Drive Mechanisms between the various weapons represents a novel feature of the DEADCo Multiple Weapons System. Most weapon systems have all weapons coupled on the same axis of elevation and driven by the same elevation drive mechanism. Examples of this paradigm are the 0.50 cal 40 mm UGWS and a co axial machine gun mounted next to the main weapon on a M1A1 M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank. The decoupled elevation drive mechanisms and enable launching weapons ordnance with different ballistic properties to sight in on the same target concurrently or even simultaneously 

Automatic Drift Correction is provided with the cradle for the deflection weapon to automatically adjust for drift at a given range upon submission of the range input to the elevation drive mechanism . This mechanism elevates and trains the deflection weapon independently of the turret or mount structure allowing the operator to maintain the LOS to target while engaging with the deflection weapon . Thus with a single input range to target the mechanism provides a full elevation and train angle correction for the deflection weapon without sacrificing ability to engage with the LOS weapon .

An alternative to this system is to employ two or more automatic drift correction weapon cradles with a decoupled fire control system. The fire control can then send a single input to all weapon cradles thus using a single signal to drive gun pointing commands to multiple weapons.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
