title: Sound based fire alarm system and method
abstract: Stovetop fires are among the more prevalent of resident fire hazards and smoke detectors are among the most prevalent and economical forms of residential fire alarms. Automatic stovetop fire extinguishers can prevent property damage and even personal injury; however, these stovetop fire extinguishers may also limit smoke emissions and the subsequent detection of smoke. While an initial fire may be efficiently subdued by an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher, it is often desirable to alert present and future occupants of a fire hazardous condition. A sound based fire alarm system and method are described herein, which detects a sound burst emitted upon deployment of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher and triggers a continuous fire alarm to alert occupants of a potentially fire hazardous condition. Alarm signals can be audible, visual, or both. The system may be a stand alone system and use battery power for affordability and ease of installation. The method described herein enables the ready and automatic extinguishment of a stovetop fire, while alerting those in the surrounding area or those in adjacent dwellings of a fire situation.
