This application is the U.S. National Phase under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT JP2010 068340 filed on Oct. 19 2010 which in turn claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 2009 240145 filed on Oct. 19 2009 the disclosures of which applications are incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to a backrest for a chair the backrest having a back frame upholstered with a bag like upholstery material by fitting the bag like upholstery material onto the back frame.

As a bag like upholstery material for the backrests described in Patent Literatures 1 and 2 a meshed woven material of synthetic fibers is often used from the viewpoint of ventilation stretch properties and tensile strength for example.

When such an upholstery material is used to upholster a back frame by fitting the upholstery material onto the back frame in a predetermined tensioned state the inner peripheral surfaces of side portions of the bag shaped upholstery material may strongly contact the outer surfaces of right and left side frames of the back frame thereby creating large sliding resistance between the contacting portions and possibly resulting in the following problems.

For example when a sitting person falls back on the backrest a front surface portion of the upholstery material positioned to the front of the back frame is warped backward while a back surface portion of the upholstery material positioned to the rear of the back frame is pulled around to the front surface side of the upholstery material. At this time when the sliding resistance at the area of contact between the right and left side frames of the back frame and the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material is large smooth movement of the back surface portion of the upholstery material toward the front surface side is difficult. As a result the front surface portion of the upholstery material may fail to be effectively warped backward or may lose flexibility thus failing to support the back of the sitting person in a comfortable manner.

Further when the sliding resistance at the area of contact between the side frames and the upholstery material is large unpleasant sliding noise may be produced from the area of contact between the side frames and the upholstery material when the sitting person falls back onto the backrest.

The sliding resistance at the area of contact between the side portions of the upholstery material on a lower side thereof where the sitting person is supported around his or her hip and the side frames may be increased while the sliding resistance at the area of contact between the side portions of the upholstery material on an upper side thereof supporting the person s back and the side frames may be reduced. In this way areas around the hip may be comfortably supported by a lumbar support effect provided by the lower portion of the upholstery material while also comfortably supporting the back. However none of the inventions according to the cited literature address the problem of varying the sliding resistance.

For the foregoing reasons there is a need for a backrest for a chair capable of providing a pleasant sense of sitting by allowing the front surface portion of the upholstery material to be effectively warped backward preventing the unpleasant sliding noise produced from the area of contact between the side frames of the back frame and the upholstery material and comfortably supporting the hip and back of the sitting person.

 1 A backrest for a chair comprising a bag like upholstery material with which a back frame is upholstered by fitting the bag like upholstery material onto the back frame that has a pair of right and left side frames extending in an up down direction wherein a low friction member is disposed on at least one of an inner surface of both side portions of the upholstery material and an outer surface of the right and left side frames contacting the inner surface of the side portions of the upholstery material the low friction member being configured to reduce a sliding resistance in an area of contact between the upholstery material and the side frames.

According to the above described configuration when the sitting person falls back on the backrest the side portions of the upholstery material that are in contact with the outer surfaces of the side frames can be smoothly moved around toward the front side. Thus the front surface portion of the upholstery material can be effectively warped backward in such a manner as to fit the back of the sitting person thereby providing a pleasant sense of seating.

Further because the side portions of the upholstery material can be smoothly moved around to the front surface side the unpleasant sliding noise from the area of contact between the upholstery material and the side frames can be prevented.

 2 A backrest for a chair comprising a bag like upholstery material with which a back frame is upholstered by fitting the bag like upholstery material onto the back frame that has a pair of right and left side frames extending in an up down direction wherein a low friction member is disposed on at least one of an inner surface of both side portions of the upholstery material on an upper portion side thereof supporting the back of a sitting person and an outer surface of the right and left side frames contacting the inner surface of the side portions of the upholstery material on an upper portion side thereof the low friction member being configured to reduce a sliding resistance in an area of contact between the upholstery material and the side frames and a high friction member is disposed on at least one of the inner surface of the side portions of the upholstery material on a lower portion side thereof supporting the sitting person around the hip and the outer surface of the right and left side frames contacting the inner surface of the side portions of the upholstery material on a lower portion side thereof the high friction member being configured to increase the sliding resistance in an area of contact between the upholstery material and the side frames.

According to the above described configuration when the sitting person falls back on the backrest the side portions of the upholstery material on the upper side thereof that contact the outer surfaces of the frames can be smoothly moved around to the front side. Thus the front surface portion of the upholstery material on the upper portion side thereof supporting the back of the sitting person can be effectively warped backward in such a manner as to fit the back while the side portions of the upholstery material on the lower portion side thereof supporting the sitting person around the hip can be prevented from being easily moved around toward the front side. Accordingly an excessive backward warping of the front surface portion of the upholstery material on the lower portion side can be prevented.

As a result the back of the sitting person can be comfortably supported in a flexible manner while the sitting person can also be comfortably supported around the hip by the lumbar support effect. Thus a pleasant sense of seating can be obtained.

Further the lower portion of the upholstery material can be prevented from moving upward with respect to the side frames or from having a slack or wrinkles.

 3 In the above described aspect 2 stitched portions are formed by internally folding and stitching both side end portions of the upholstery material to cause the upholstery material to be bag like each of the stitched portions being covered by a side end portion of the high friction member fixed by stitching.

 4 In any the above described aspects 1 to 3 stitched portions are formed by internally folding and stitching both side end portions of the upholstery material to cause the upholstery material to be bag like each of the stitched portions being covered by a side end portion of the low friction member fixed by stitching.

According to the above described configuration of aspect 3 or 4 the stitched portion of the side end portions of the upholstery material is covered with the side end portion of the low friction member or the high friction member by stitching. Thus the stitched portion of the side end portions of the upholstery material can be reinforced so that the upholstery material can be prevented from being frayed.

Because the upholstery material can slide with respect to the side frames via the low friction member or the high friction member affixed to the inner surface of the side portions of the upholstery material wearing of the side portions of the upholstery material can be reduced so that the reupholstering intervals of the upholstery material can be extended and cost can be reduced.

 5 In any the above described aspects 2 to 4 the high friction member is formed by one of a polyurethane resin or a foam thereof a urethane elastomer and rubber.

 6 In any the above described aspects 1 to 5 the low friction member is formed by one of a polyamide resin a fluororesin and a polyacetal.

According to the above described configuration of aspect 5 or 6 all of the recited materials are preferable for the low friction member or the high friction member readily formable and highly versatile. Thus the structure can be relatively inexpensively implemented.

The aspects of the present invention provide a backrest for a chair which backrest is capable of providing a pleasant sense of sitting by effectively warping the front surface portion of the upholstery material backward preventing the development of unpleasant sliding noise from the area of contact between the side frames of the back frame and the upholstery material and comfortably supporting the hip and back of the sitting person.

In the following embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

The support base has a substantially triangular shape expanding from the upper end of the leg column toward the front in plan and side views.

At the front end of the support base a front lower portion of a seat is pivotally mounted on a base axle extending in a left right direction. The seat can be rotated about the base axle into a standby position in which the seat is inclined with its rear raised as illustrated in or into a use position in which the seat is horizontal or inclined with its rear slightly lowered as illustrated in .

The arm rests extend upward from the sides of the rear of the seat and include a backrest pivotal support portion and an arm pad portion . The backrest pivotal support portion includes a curved surface protruding backward and having a semicircular or fan shape in a side view which shape is centered about a support axle of a backrest which will be described later. The arm pad portion extends forward from an upper portion of the backrest pivotal support portion and has an upwardly arched shape. Thus the arm rests have a generally forwardly extending triangular shape converging in a forward upper direction in a side view.

The arm pad portions may be dimensioned with respect to the front rear direction such that front end portions of the arm pad portions are positioned forwardly of a vertical line S passing through the center of the base axle on which the seat is pivoted in the standby position illustrated in .

When the seat is in the use position as illustrated in the front end portions of the arm pad portions may be positioned slightly to the rear of the vertical line S corresponding to the base axle on which the seat is pivoted.

On outer surfaces of slightly forward portions of the backrest pivotal support portions of the right and left arm rests front end portions of forwardly extending side pieces extending forward from a lower portion of the backrest on both sides are located. The front end portions are pivoted on the support axle extending substantially in the left right direction. Thus the backrest can be rotated about the support axle into an upright position illustrated in or a backwardly inclined position not illustrated with respect to the seat and the arm rests .

The backrest includes a concave surface facing the rear surface of the backrest pivotal support portions and having an arch shape substantially complementary to the curved surface on the rear surface of the backrest pivotal support portions . Thus the backrest can be rotated about the support axle with the opposed surfaces positioned close to each other. Between a central portion of a lower frame which will be described later of the backrest with respect to the left right direction and an upper surface of the front end portion of the support base a first biasing portion for biasing the backrest in an upright direction is provided. Examples of the first biasing portion may include a gas spring and a compression spring.

The support base includes a second biasing portion for helping the sitting person stand up by biasing the seat into the standby position.

The second biasing portion includes a rubber torsion unit having an axis in the left right direction a backwardly extending first link linked with the rubber torsion unit and biased in the anticlockwise direction in the side view of and a second link having a lower end portion pivoted to the end of the first link via an axis extending in the left right direction. An upper end portion of the second link is pivoted on a lower surface of the seat in an intermediate area in the front rear direction via an axis extending in the left right direction the second link extending in a diagonally upward rear direction.

As illustrated in the backrest extends in the up down direction and includes a back frame having a vertically longer rectangular shape in a front elevation. The back frame includes a pair of right and left side frames extending in the up down direction and having a gradually increasing front rear dimension toward the lower ends with which the forwardly extending side pieces are continuously connected. The upper ends of the side frames are coupled via an upper frame extending in the left right direction. The lower ends of the side frames are coupled via a lower frame extending in the left right direction. The upper frame and the lower frame are coupled at their intermediate portions in the left right direction via an intermediate frame which is positioned backwardly of the side frames and extending in the up down direction.

The back frame may be integrally formed from a synthetic resin material having an appropriate elasticity. Preferably the synthetic resin material may contain reinforced fibers such as glass or carbon fibers for increased strength.

The lower portions of the side frames and a lower portion of the intermediate frame are arched with the center of curvature located forwardly in a side view. The upper frame and the lower frame are curved in a plan view with their intermediate portions positioned backwardly of their side portions. Thus when the back frame is upholstered with a bag like upholstery material as will be described later a front surface portion and a back surface portion of the upholstery material with respect to the back frame are allowed to be relatively greatly spaced apart from each other in the front rear direction.

Further the lower portion of the backrest is also backwardly spaced from the rear ends of the seat and the arm rests . Thus when the backrest is rotated interference with the rear ends of the seat and the arm rests is prevented so that the backrest can have a large range of backward rotation.

The intermediate frame may be thinner than the other frame forming members of the back frame so that the intermediate frame can be more readily elastically deformed than the other members. In this way when the front surface portion of the upholstery material is subjected to a load as will be described later the intermediate frame can be elastically deformed in the backward direction.

At the upper end of the back frame a head rest frame is integrally formed. The head rest frame includes upwardly extending extension frames which are curved with intermediate portions thereof positioned forwardly of the upper and lower portions thereof in a side view. Upper ends of the extension frames are coupled to each other via a top frame extending in the left right direction.

As illustrated in the back frame and the head rest frame are upholstered from above with the bag like upholstery material by fitting the bag like upholstery material onto the back frame and the head rest frame . The upholstery material includes openings in the lower end and lower side portions and has stretch properties. The upholstery material may be in the form of a mesh woven from synthetic fibers. The upholstery material includes a head rest covering portion covering the head rest frame and a backrest covering portion covering the back frame .

The back frame and the head rest frame are covered with the upholstery material in a predetermined tensioned state. The right and left forwardly extending side pieces protrude in the forward direction through the lower side openings of the upholstery material . Lower end portions of a front surface portion and a back surface portion of the upholstery material positioned to the front and rear of the back frame respectively are joined to each other via a joining means below the lower frame of the back frame . Examples of the joining means include hook and loop fasteners hooks and zippers not illustrated .

When the head rest is not required the head rest frame and the head rest covering portion of the upholstery material may be omitted.

As illustrated in thin and flexible low friction members having small sliding resistance with respect to the frames and are disposed on inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material that contact outer surfaces of the side frames of the back frame excepting the forwardly extending side pieces and outer surfaces of the extension frames of the head rest frame .

Thin and flexible high friction members having large sliding resistance with respect to the side frames are disposed on inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material where the sitting person is supported around his or her hip the inner surfaces contacting the outer surfaces of lower portions of the side frames .

Preferably the low friction members may include a material such as a polyamide resin trade name Nylon fluororesin Teflon registered trademark trade name Daiflon or polyacetal. The high friction members may include a material such as a polyurethane resin or a foam thereof a urethane elastomer or rubber.

As illustrated in enlarged cross sections of the side end portions of the upholstery material are inwardly folded into layers and stitched into bag shaped portions at positions close to the inner surfaces on the front side of the right and left side frames or extension frames . At the same time the front end portions of the low friction member and the high friction member are folded into U shaped portions by which the folded portions of the upholstery material are covered by stitching. In this way stitched portions of the side end portions of the upholstery material can be reinforced. The front end portions of the low friction member and the high friction member may be simply stitched onto the stitched portions of the side end portions of the upholstery material simultaneously without being folded in U shape.

The low friction member and the high friction member may be affixed onto the outer surfaces of the side frames and the extension frames or onto the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material by using an adhesive rather than by stitching.

As illustrated in a concave groove may be formed in the outer surfaces of the side frames and the extension frames in the up down direction and a convex portion may be formed on inner surfaces of the low friction member and the high friction member in the up down direction. In this way by fitting the convex portion in the concave groove the low friction member and the high friction member can be detachably mounted on the outer surfaces of the side frames and the extension frames .

Further as illustrated in the low friction member and the high friction member configured to be elastically deformable may be detachably fitted on the outer surfaces of the side frames and the extension frames . In this case the concave groove illustrated in may not be provided in the side frames and the extension frames .

The low friction member and the high friction member may be a film formed on the outer surfaces of the side frames and the extension frames by coating.

When the sitting person falls back on the backrest structured as described above the back surface portion of the upholstery material is pulled and extended as the front surface portion of the upholstery material is extended and warped backward as indicated by the two dot chain line in . As a result the side portions of the upholstery material are pulled around toward the front surface portion to some extent as indicated by arrows so that the amount of warping of the front surface portion in the backward direction increases. At this time because the low friction members attached to the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material are in contact with the outer surfaces of the side frames except for the lower portions thereof and with the outer surfaces of the extension frames the sliding resistance at their areas of contact is reduced.

Consequently the upper side portions of the upholstery material are permitted to smoothly move around toward the front surface side so that the front surface portion of the upholstery material supporting the back and head of the sitting person can be effectively warped backward in such a manner as to fit the back and head of the sitting person. Thus the back and head of the sitting person can be comfortably supported with flexibility.

Also the development of unpleasant sliding noise can be prevented when the side portions of the upholstery material are moved around toward the front surface portion

Further because the upholstery material slides with respect to the side frames via the low friction members affixed on the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material wearing of the side portions of the upholstery material can be reduced so that the reupholstering intervals can be extended and cost can be reduced.

On the other hand the high friction members are attached to the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material where the sitting person is supported around the hip the inner surfaces contacting the outer surfaces of the lower portions of the right and left side frames . Thus the sliding resistance between the side frames and the lower side portions of the upholstery material is increased.

As a result even when the lower portions of the side frames are curved into an arch shape extending forward the lower portions of the side portions of the upholstery material are prevented from moving up thus preventing slackening or development of wrinkles in the lower portion of the upholstery material .

Further because the movement of the lower side portions of the upholstery material toward the front side of the back frame is prevented or reduced the lower portion of the front surface portion of the upholstery material where the sitting person is supported around the hip can be maintained in a properly tensioned state and prevented from being excessively warped backward. Thus the lumbar support effect can be obtained and the hip of the sitting person can be comfortably supported thereby providing enhanced comfort to the sitting person.

In the embodiments illustrated in the side portions of the upholstery material can slide with respect to the low friction member and the high friction member attached to the side frames . Thus effects similar to those described above can be obtained because of the small and large sliding resistances provided between the upholstery material and the side frames .

The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments and may include various other modifications or implementations.

For example while the low friction member according to the foregoing embodiments has been described as being long and continuous in the up down direction a plurality of short low friction members may be disposed at predetermined intervals in the up down direction.

In the foregoing embodiments the low friction members may be disposed on the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material or on the outer surfaces of the side frames . The low friction members may be disposed on both the outer surfaces of the side frames and the inner surfaces of the side portions of the upholstery material so that the low friction members can be contacted with each other.

The present invention may be applied to the backrest for conventional chairs having the seat that is not inclined up or down.
