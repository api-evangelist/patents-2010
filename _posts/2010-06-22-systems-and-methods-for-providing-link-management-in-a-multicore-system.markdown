For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

The hardware of the appliance such as a NIC or the kernel may be designed and constructed to support sequential operations across the NICs and or cores.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

The flow distributor can distribute network traffic among the cores according to a distribution computing or load balancing scheme such as those described herein. In one embodiment the flow distributor can distribute network traffic or pad according to any one of a functional parallelism distribution scheme a data parallelism load distribution scheme a flow based data parallelism distribution scheme or any combination of these distribution scheme or any load balancing scheme for distributing load among multiple processors.

The RSS module can execute within the NIC in some embodiments and in other embodiments can execute on any one of the cores .

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined bases on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask. Each bucket may comprise a range of index values that identify a core or processor.

In some embodiments the multi core system does not include a RSS driver or RSS module . In some of these embodiments a software steering module not shown or a software embodiment of the RSS module within the system can operate in conjunction with or as part of the flow distributor to steer packets to cores within the multi core system .

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores .

In such an embodiment CISCO s vn tag mechanism can be used to alter or tag each packet with the appropriate meta data.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan .

At step a determination is made as to whether an entry is found in the local ARP table matching the requested protocol address. If so at step a determination is made of the associated hardware address. At step the core may transmit data to the determined hardware address. If an entry is not found in the local ARP table at step then at step a determination is made as to whether the core is the default master or designated core. If so at step the default master or designated core may broadcast an ARP request for the requested protocol address over the network . If the core is not the default master or designated core then at step the core may transmit an inter core message to the default master or designated core requesting resolution of the requested protocol address. At step the default master or designated core may consult its local ARP table . At step a determination is made as to whether an entry is found in the default core s local ARP table matching the requested protocol address. Responsive to a negative determination the default core may broadcast an ARP request over the network as in step . If an entry is found at step then the default core may determine an associated hardware address at step . At step the default core may transmit an inter core message to the requesting core identifying the hardware address associated with the requested protocol address. At step the requesting core may add an entry to its local ARP table and transmit data to the determined hardware address.

Still referring to and in more detail at step a core may receive a request to transmit data to an address and the address may be identified only by a protocol address. In some embodiments this request may come from an application function process daemon and may be executed on behalf of a user or users or an operating system. The data may be data or requests for data or requests to open a connection with a remote device or any other type or form of data packet transmitted over a network .

At step the core consults a local ARP table for an entry matching the requested protocol address. In some embodiments the core may execute a hashing function on the requested protocol address to determine an index number in the local ARP table . In other embodiments the core may seek an entry by an index corresponding to the requested protocol address. In still other embodiments the core may search through part or all of the local ARP table . In yet other embodiments the core may use any other functionality or process for finding an item within a data structure.

At step a determination is made as to whether an entry has been found in the local ARP table corresponding to the requested protocol address. In some embodiments this determination could be a boolean comparison of the requested protocol address and address in the local ARP table being considered. In other embodiments any other function or functions for comparing two items of data may be used. In some embodiments steps and may be executed in multiple iterations until an entry has been found. In further embodiments steps and may be executed iteratively until the entire local ARP table has been searched. In other embodiments steps and may be executed iteratively a number of times either pre determined or determined in response to the size of or the number of entries in the local ARP table .

At step responsive to an entry being found in the local ARP table corresponding to the requested protocol address the core may determine an associated hardware address. In many embodiments the associated hardware address may be found in the local ARP table at the same or a corresponding entry. In other embodiments the local ARP table may be associated with or contain an association to another data structure containing hardware addresses indexed in a way that corresponds to the protocol addresses indexed in the local ARP table . In some embodiments the determination of an associated hardware address may be made by retrieving data from the local ARP table or associated data structure.

At step the core may transmit the data to the associated hardware address. In some embodiments the core may utilize any of the functions described above in reference to flow distributor or NIC .

Responsive to a determination at step than an entry was not found in the local ARP table corresponding to the requested protocol address at step a determination is made as to whether the core is the default master or designated core. Although discussed below in reference to a default core in some embodiments the terms master core default core or designated core may be used interchangeably. In some embodiments the default core may be identified by a switch or a data flag in an identification field. In other embodiments the default core may be the core with the lowest hardware address. In still other embodiments the default core may be the core with the lowest execution priority. In still other embodiments the default core may be determined by any other method yielding one default core. In some embodiments a backup default core or cores may be further identified for instance by the next lowest hardware address. In such embodiments a backup default core may be selected as a new default core responsive to an error or overloading of the default core or any other indication.

Responsive to a determination at step that the core is the default core or currently active default core at step the core may broadcast an ARP request over the network . In some embodiments the core may utilize any of the functions described above in reference to flow distributor or NIC to transmit the request. The ARP request may be an ARP packet identified above and may include the requested protocol address as the target protocol address. In some embodiments the ARP request may also include the hardware and protocol address of the core as the sender s hardware and protocol addresses. In such embodiments this may allow devices receiving the ARP request to associate the protocol address of the core with the hardware address in ARP tables maintained by such devices eliminating the need for them to transmit ARP requests for the protocol address of core .

Responsive to a determination at step that the core is not the default core the core may transmit an inter core message to the default core or core currently acting as the default core. This message may include a request to resolve the requested protocol address into a hardware address. In some embodiments this message may be a standard ARP Packet identified above. In other embodiments this message may be in a different proprietary or non proprietary protocol. In further embodiments this message may be transmitted directly or unicast to the default core while in other embodiments the message may be broadcast to all cores. In such embodiments cores receiving the message that are not the default core may discard or disregard the message.

At step the default core may consult its local ARP table using any of the methods identified above at step or any other method for finding an item within a data structure. Similarly at step the default core may determine whether an entry corresponding to the requested protocol address has been found using any of the methods identified above at step . In some embodiments step may include the iterative searches identified above in connection with step . Responsive to a determination at step that no corresponding entry has been found the default core may broadcast an ARP request as discussed above in connection with step .

If an entry corresponding to the requested protocol address has been found by the default core at step then at step the default core determines the associated hardware address. The determination of the hardware address may be performed using any of the methods identified in step or any other similar method.

At step the default core transmits an inter core message to the requesting core . This message may identify the hardware address associated with the protocol address requested at . In some embodiments this message may be a standard ARP Packet identified above. In other embodiments this message may be in a different proprietary or non proprietary protocol. In one embodiment this message may be transmitted directly or unicast to the requesting core while in another embodiment the message may be broadcast to all cores.

At step in some embodiments the core s receiving the inter core message may add an entry to their local ARP table s associating the hardware address with the protocol address. Furthermore in one embodiment the core that received the request to transmit data to a protocol address at step may transmit data to the associated hardware address using any of the methods identified at step or any similar method.

Referring now to a flow chart is shown illustrating an embodiment of a method of managing a received ARP message. In brief overview at step the default core may receive an ARP message. At step a determination is made as to whether the message was received in response to an ARP request transmitted by the default core . If so at step the default core may add an entry to its local ARP table . At step the default core may unicast or broadcast the ARP information in the response to another core or cores. At step the other core or cores may add an entry to their local ARP table s . At step the default core may transmit data to the hardware address identified by the ARP message. Responsive to the determination at step that the message is not a response to an ARP request at step the default core may consult its local ARP table for an entry corresponding to the sender protocol or hardware address identified in the ARP message. At step a determination is made as to whether an entry has been found. If so at step the default core may add an entry to its local ARP table corresponding to the sender protocol and or hardware address. If an entry has been found then at step a determination is made as to whether the received entry is an update. If so at step the default core may update the entry in its local ARP table. If the default core added an entry at step or updated an entry at step then at step in some embodiments the default core may unicast or broadcast the ARP information to another core or cores. Responsive to receiving the ARP information at step the other cores may add or update entries in their local ARP tables. At step a determination is made if the target IP of the ARP message is owned by one or more of the cores. If not at step the packet may be bridged to another network segment. If the target IP is owned by the cores at step the default core may transmit an ARP response to the requestor.

In one example of an embodiment of the method shown in a default core may receive an ARP message from a host with a sender protocol address of 1.2.3.4 and hardware address of 11 11 11 11 11 11. In some embodiments the default core may receive the ARP message due to the Flow Distributor sending all ARP messages to the default core. Accordingly the default core may maintain a record of transmitted or pending ARP requests and may determine at step that the received ARP message is not a response to a pending request. If the default core finds no corresponding entry in its local ARP table for the sender information then it may add an entry. To allow coordination and reduce ARP requests from other cores the default core may broadcast the entry or information corresponding to the entry to all other cores at step . These cores may then add an entry to their local ARP tables so that they need not send ARP requests for routing future messages to IP 1.2.3.4. In one embodiment where the requested or target IP address in the ARP message is an IP local to appliance or owned by the cores the default core may then respond to IP 1.2.3.4 with an ARP message identifying the hardware address of the target IP.

Referring now to a flow chart is shown illustrating an embodiment of a method of coordinating flushes of ARP entries from local ARP tables in a multi core system. In one such embodiment at step a timer on a default core may expire. The default core may make a determination at step if an ARP entry should be flushed. If so the default core may unicast or broadcast a message to one or more other cores instructing them to flush a corresponding ARP entry in their local ARP tables. If not the timer may be reset at step .

In one example embodiment of the method shown in responsive to a timer expiring the default core may determine if an ARP entry in its local ARP table may need to be flushed. In some embodiments the ARP table comprises a timestamp identifying when the ARP entry was created or last updated. In one such embodiment the default core may flush an entry responsive to a difference between the current time and the timestamp exceeding a predetermined threshold. In other embodiments the ARP table comprises a flag or indicator that may be set when an entry is created or updated. In one such embodiment responsive to expiration of the timer if an entry has an associated flag or indicator set the default core may unset the flag or indicator. In a further embodiment responsive to expiration of the timer if an entry does not have an associated flag or indicator set the default core may flush the entry. This allows for an entry to be in a set state indicating it was created or modified since the last timer expiration and an unset state indicating it was not. On the next expiration of the timer the entry may then be flushed. Responsive to flushing an entry the default core may broadcast an inter core or core to core message to other cores instructing them to flush the entry. In some embodiments through the methods outlined above the ARP tables of all cores may be identical or substantially similar.

If a Neighbor Advertisement NA packet is received completing the entry the entry may be set to the REACHABLE state . In some embodiments the core receiving the NA packet may broadcast an inter core update message to other cores to allow them to update a corresponding entry or entries in their local Routing Tables. Upon expiration of a timer on the core the entry may be set to the STALE state . Additionally in some embodiments if a NS packet is received with a sender address identified an entry may be added or updated and placed in the STALE state . When the core sends a packet to the address identified by the entry the entry is placed in the DELAY state . In some embodiments if a response packet from the address is received during the DELAY state the entry may be updated and placed in the REACHABLE state . In some embodiments the core may broadcast an inter core update message to other cores to allow them to update a corresponding entry or entries in their local Routing Tables. If no response packet is received during the DELAY state upon expiration of a timer on the core the entry may be placed in the PROBE state . In some embodiments the core may send one or more NS packets to the address corresponding to the entry. If a corresponding NA packet is received from the address the core may place the address in the REACHABLE state responsive to no difference in the address identified in the NA packet and the address in the entry in the local Routing Table. Alternately in some embodiments the core may place the address in the STALE state responsive to a difference in the address identified in the NA packet and the address in the entry in the local Routing Table. Additionally if no response is received to the one or more NS packets sent to the address by the core the core may in some embodiments delete the entry. In further embodiments the core may broadcast an inter core delete message instructing one or more other cores to delete a corresponding entry or entries in their local Routing Tables.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for performing neighbor discovery in a multi core environment. In one such embodiment at step a first core may receive a request from an application process service function or daemon to transmit a data packet to an address identified by a protocol address. At step the first core may select an owner core for the protocol address. At step the first core may send the owner core a request to resolve the protocol address into a hardware address. At step the owner core may make a determination as to whether it has an entry in a local Routing Table for the protocol address. If the owner core has an entry that is in the REACHABLE state as discussed above in connection with in some embodiments the owner core may send an inter core update message to the first core notifying or informing it of the entry. Responsive to a determination that the owner core does not have an entry corresponding to the protocol address at step the owner core may create an entry. Responsive to a determination that the owner core does have an entry corresponding to the protocol address at step in some embodiments if the entry is not in the REACHABLE state the owner core may change the entry state to PROBE or DELAY. At step the owner core may send an NS packet to the target protocol address. At step in some embodiments the owner core may receive a corresponding NA packet. At step responsive to receiving the NA packet the owner core may send a broadcast inter core update message to one or more other cores including the first core. At step the one or more cores and the owner core may update or add an entry to their local Routing Tables corresponding to the protocol address and hardware address identified in the NA packet. At step the one or more cores and the owner core may set the entry to the REACHABLE state as discussed above in connection with . In a further embodiment the core that received the request to transmit to the protocol address at step may transmit the packet to the identified hardware address.

In one example embodiment of the method illustrated in a core may receive a request to transmit to a protocol address from an application or host. In some embodiments the core may have an entry in its local Routing Table associated with the protocol address and the entry may have an indicator that the entry is currently set to REACHABLE. If so the core may transmit to the hardware address. However if not the core may select an owner core for the address which in some embodiments may be selected responsive to the core to which Flow Distributor routes or will route communications from the protocol address. The owner core may either create an entry associated with the protocol address or change an existing entry state associated with the protocol address to PROBE and send a Neighbor Solicitation packet. If and when a Neighbor Advertisement packet from the solicited protocol address arrives as discussed above the Flow Distributor may route the packet to the owner core. The core may broadcast the entry to the other cores via an inter core message. All cores may then update an existing entry or create a new entry associated with the information in the Neighbor Advertisement and set the state of the entry to REACHABLE. In some embodiments a Neighbor Advertisement packet may fail to arrive at step . In such an embodiment the owner core may repeat step and send another Neighbor Solicitation packet and wait for a response. This may be repeated a predetermined number of times. If no responsive Neighbor Advertisement packet arrives within a predetermined time or number of repetitions of step the owner core may flush the entry and broadcast a command to flush the entry to other cores.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for updating or flushing a Routing Table entry in a multi core system.

Responsive to the timer expiring the core may set the entry state to STALE at step . At step the core may send a NS packet with a target protocol address corresponding to the entry. At step a determination is made as to whether a NA response packet has been received within a predetermined time period. If not at step the core may send a delete inter core message to one or more other cores instructing them to delete a corresponding entry or entries from their local Routing Tables. If so at step the core may send an update inter core message to one or more other cores including the protocol and hardware address or addresses identified in the NA response packet. At step the core may reset its timer.

In one example embodiment of the method shown in responsive to a timer expiring an owner core of an entry may set the entry state to STALE signifying that no packet has been received from the associated hardware address within a predetermined period of time. The owner core may then send a Neighbor Solicitation packet to the associated protocol address.

Although shown separate from Packet Engine in some embodiments Bridge Table and or Timer may be functions or routines of Packet Engine .

Shown in are a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for performing bridge routing in a multi core system. As shown at step a core may receive a data packet on a source channel. At step a determination is made if the packet is a Bridge Protocol Data Unit BPDU packet. If so the core may classify the packet as DROP at step and at step update the channel or port status as necessary according to the Spanning Tree Protocol state indicated by the BPDU packet. If the packet is not a BPDU packet then at step a determination is made if the packet is a Link Aggregation Control Protocol LACP packet. If so the core may classify the packet as LAG at step and at step may update the LACP state machine. If the packet is not an LACP packet then at step the core may execute a hashing function on the source MAC and or VLAN of the data packet to create an index number. At step the core may consult the entry identified by the index number in the core s local Bridge Table. At step the core may determine if a matching entry has been found. In some embodiments steps and may be repeated by incrementing the index number and re consulting the Bridge Table and this process may be repeated for a predetermined number of iterations. If a matching entry is found the core may determine at step if an inuse flag has been set on the entry. If the flag has not been set at step the core may set an inuse flag on the entry and at step may broadcast the entry via an inter core message to one or more other cores. Responsive to a matching entry not being located at step the core may determine if the entry is empty. If not the core may consult a consecutive entry at step and increment a counter i at step . In one embodiment the core may then repeat step to determine if the consecutive entry matches the source MAC and or VLAN. This process may be repeated a predetermined number of times n in some embodiments to correct for collisions in the hash algorithm used at step . At step the core may add an entry to the bridging table. At step the core may set an inuse flag on the entry and at step broadcast the entry via an inter core message to one or more other cores.

Still referring to at step the core may determine if the packet is a broadcast packet. If so at step the core may classify the packet as BCAST and at step may forward the data packet on all channels except the source channel. At step the core may determine if the packet is multicast. If so at step the core may classify the packet as MCAST and at step may forward the data packet on all channels indicated for multicast by the packet except the source channel. At step the core may determine if the packet is unicast. If not at step the core may classify the packet as unknown and at step may forward the data packet on all channels except the source channel. At step the core may determine if the destination MAC address of the packet is local to appliance . If so at step the core may classify the packet as LOCAL and at step may route the packet internally to the destination.

Still referring to at step the core may execute a hashing function on the destination MAC and or VLAN of the data packet to create an index number. At step the core may consult the entry identified by the index number in the core s local Bridge Table. At step the core may determine if a matching entry has been found. If not the core may consult a consecutive entry and increment a counter in steps and respectively and repeat step . This process may be repeated for a predetermined number of iterations for control of hash collisions. If no entry is found and the process has been repeated for the predetermined number of iterations at step the core may classify the packet as UNKNOWN and at step may forward the packet on all channels except the source channel. If an entry is found at step at step the core may determine the destination channel associated with the destination MAC and or VLAN. At step the core may classify the packet by a channel number. At step the core may determine if the source and destination channels are the same. If so at step the core may discard the packet. Otherwise at step the core may forward the data packet on the destination channel. Although described generally as being executed by a core the above method and functions may be executed by a Packet Engine by a Bridge Manager or any other form and type of executable instructions.

In an example of one embodiment of the method shown in a core may receive a unicast data packet on a source channel for bridging to a destination. For example the packet may be from a MAC address of 11 11 11 11 11 11 and IP of 1.2.3.4 and arrive on channel or port . The packet may be identified as directed to a destination of IP 2.3.4.5 which may be identified explicitly or via any of the methods discussed above for address resolution as directed to MAC address 22 22 22 22 22 22. In some embodiments the packet may also identify a VLAN. The core may execute a hashing function on the source MAC and or VLAN with for example an output of 5. The core may then consult a local Bridging Table at entry for an entry matching MAC address 11 11 11 11 11 11 and or the VLAN. If a matching entry is not found the core may check entry entry entry etc. If the core does not find a matching entry the core may then check if entry is empty followed by entry entry entry etc. until the core finds an empty entry. The core may then add an entry for MAC address 11 11 11 11 11 11 any identified VLAN and IP 1.2.3.4 and broadcast this entry to other cores to add to their local Bridging Tables.

Continuing the discussion of this example of the embodiment of the method shown in the core may execute a hashing function on the destination MAC and or VLAN with for example an output of 15. Similar to the above discussed sequence the core may consult a local Bridging Table at entry entry entry etc. until a matching entry is found. The core may then consult the entry and determine for example that MAC address 22 22 22 22 22 22 is associated with channel or port . The core may then forward the data packet to IP 2.3.4.5 and MAC 22 22 22 22 22 22 via channel or port .

In some embodiments additional network links may be further aggregated with links A B to further increase bandwidth and reliability. Additionally in some embodiments one or more network links may connect to an additional one or more NICs . In some embodiments Flow Distributor may direct traffic from a first link e.g. link A A to a first core e.g. core A and may direct traffic from a second link e.g. link B B to a second core e.g. core B. In such embodiments the systems and methods described below may be used to coordinate the first core and other cores for performing link aggregation. In one embodiment each core may include a receive state machine A N generally referred to as receive state machine and a multiplex MUX state machine A N generally referred to as a MUX state machine . In one embodiment discussed below in more detail one Packet Engine may act as a master Packet Engine for purposes of link aggregation control. In such an embodiment this Packet Engine may be referred to as a Master Packet Engine or Master PE and other Packet Engines may be referred to as Slave Packet Engine s or Slave PE s . In many embodiments the Master PE may be the only Packet Engine running a receive state machine . Also as shown in each core may include a Periodic Transmission state machine A N referred to generally as Periodic Transmission state machine . In many embodiments the Master PE may be the only Packet Engine running a Periodic Transmission state machine . Although receive state machines MUX state machines and periodic transmissions state machines are shown in as separate from Packet Engines A N in many embodiments the state machines are functions or subroutines of Packet Engines A N. Also shown in are Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit LACPDU Packets A and B. In many embodiments LACPDU packets A and B may conform or substantially conform to IEEE standard 802.3 2005 section 43 while in other embodiments LACPDU packets A and B may conform to any protocol for communicating link aggregation status updates. Similarly in some embodiments Receive Machine MUX machine and Periodic Transmission Machine may be substantially similar to corresponding state machines described in IEEE standard 802.3 2005 with the modifications discussed below with regard to . In further embodiments two entities participating in link aggregation such as a first appliance and a second appliance or a first appliance and a router switch or other device may be referred to as an actor and a partner.

Shown in is a state machine diagram of an embodiment of a receive state machine . In many embodiments the receive state machine receives LACPDU packets from a partner and records the information contained in the packet. In further embodiments and responsive to expiration of a timer receive state machine controls coordination with the partner or installs default parameter values for use by other state machines including the MUX state machine and the periodic transmission state machine . As described above in connection with in many embodiments the receive state machine is run only by the Master PE. In one embodiment the receive state machine begins in a state of INIT . As shown the state machine may move to the PORT DISABLED state . In response to a port moved variable being set to true the machine may return to the INIT state . Responsive to link aggregation being disabled the machine may move to the LACP DISABLED state . If the port and link aggregation are enabled the machine may move to the EXPIRED state . If a packet is received before expiration of a timer the receive state machine may move to the CURRENT state . If a packet is not received the machine may move to the DEFAULTED state . Responsive to receipt of a packet the machine may move to the CURRENT state as above. In response to expiration of the timer without another packet being received the state machine may move to the EXPIRED state again.

Shown in is a state machine diagram of an embodiment of a MUX state machine . In many embodiments the input status of the MUX state machine is dependent on output status from receive state machine . Because in many embodiments all Packet Engines run a MUX state machine but only the Master PE runs a receive state machine a coordination system as follows may be employed. In one such embodiment the Master PE may broadcast an inter core status message to one or more Slave PEs in response to entering the states DETATCHED ATTACHED COLLECTING and DISTRIBUTING . In some embodiments the input to the MUX state machine is a variable with a status of Selected Unselected or Standby. In many embodiments a Packet Engine such as the Master PE determines the status of the selected unselected standby variable using functions and selection logic as described in IEEE standard 802.3.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method of link aggregation control in a multi core device. In brief overview at step a core maintaining a MUX state machine may receive an LACP packet. If the MUX state machine is in a current state of detached at step the core may update the MUX state machine according to the above discussed state diagram. If the MUX state machine is in a current state of waiting and the input is standby then the core may wait for another LACP packet at step . If the MUX state machine is in a current state of waiting and the input is not standby or if the MUX state machine is not in a current state of waiting then at step the core may update the MUX state machine according to the above discussed state diagram. At step the core may send a broadcast unicast multicast or other inter core message to notify the other cores of the new state and or the LACP input. At step the other cores may update additional MUX state machines maintained by each other core accordingly.

Still referring to as discussed above in many embodiments the Master PE may be the only Packet Engine running a receive state machine . In a further embodiment at step or step the Master PE may update the receive state machine in addition to updating the MUX state machine. For example upon receipt of a packet the Master PE may move from the expired or defaulted states to the current state discussed above in reference to . As discussed in IEEE standard 802.3 2005 the receive state machine may determine whether and how the Master PE should update the value of the selected variable between selected unselected and standby . Accordingly changes in the state of the receive state machine cause corresponding changes in the state of the MUX state machine .

Shown in is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system utilizing virtual router redundancy in a multi core environment. In some embodiments virtual router redundancy allows a master and one or more backup routers to act as a single virtual router. In one such embodiment routers use a virtual MAC address from a predetermined range of MAC addresses. When a client or server sends a data packet to the virtual MAC address the master and one or more backup routers may receive the packet and the master router may bridge the packet as necessary. If the master router fails the client or server may not need to determine the MAC address of a backup router. Rather the client or server may continue sending packets to the virtual MAC address and one of the backup routers may assume the bridging duties of the master router. In some embodiments this redundancy system may be transparent to the client or server and the client or server may not know that the previous master router has failed. In many embodiments main and backup routers in a virtual router configuration communicate through multicast packets such as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol VRRP packet for the purpose of advertising the status of the master router or advertising when a backup router has taken over the master router s duties. In a multi core environment due to Flow Distributor any of cores A N may receive a VRRP packet . To allow for coordination and common knowledge of the status of a master router among cores A N the following systems and methods may be used to facilitate virtual router operations in a multi core system. As shown in each core A N may include a VRRP Manager A N referred to generally as VRRP Manager s . In some embodiments each VRRP Manager may also maintain a VMAC Table A N referred to generally as VMAC Table s . In additional embodiments each VRRP Manager may also maintain a timer A N referred to generally as timer s . Although VRRP Managers VMAC Tables and timers are shown in as separate from Packet Engines A N in many embodiments they are functions or subroutines of Packet Engines A N. Also shown in is an example VRRP packet . In some embodiments NIC may also transmit VRRP Packet to the Network . In such an embodiment one of Packet Engines A N may be serving as a master router for a virtual router system. In some embodiments VRRP packet may conform to IETF RFC 3768. In other embodiments VRRP packet may conform to the Hot Standby Routing Protocol by Cisco Systems Inc. In still other embodiments VRRP packet may conform to the Common Address Redundancy Protocol as utilized by OpenBSD. In yet other embodiments VRRP packet may conform to any other protocol for communicating router availability in a virtual router system. As shown in one implementation VRRP packet may include version and type fields an 8 bit Virtual Router ID a priority number of the router originating VRRP packet a count of IP addresses contained in the VRRP packet an authentication type an advertisement interval a 16 bit checksum a number of IP addresses that are associated with the virtual router with the number of addresses specified by the count of IP addresses field and an authentication string.

Shown in is an example embodiment of a VMAC table . In one embodiment the VMAC table maintains an index of VMAC addresses associated with a virtual router. In some embodiments VMAC table may be a library index list file registry or other data structure embodied on a memory element accessible to a core a Packet Engine a VRRP manager a VIP server or other agent service process routine function or logic executing on a core. In some embodiments VMAC table comprises fields identifying the MAC address identified in a VRRP packet the priority identified in the VRRP packet and one or more IP addresses identified in the VRRP packet . In a further embodiment VMAC table may comprise a field identifying an owner core or Packet Engine that received a VRRP packet corresponding to the entry. In yet another embodiment VMAC table may comprise an indicator of whether the entry is static meaning the entry was added when the Packet Engine was configured or dynamic meaning the entry was added responsive to reception of a VRRP packet . In a further embodiment the VMAC table may further comprise a field identifying a timestamp at which a VRRP packet corresponding to the entry was received. In another embodiment the VMAC table may further comprise a field identifying whether an entry has been updated recently. In one such embodiment the field may comprise a flag or other indicator.

Shown in is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method for coordinating adding entries to a VMAC table in a multi core system. As shown in some embodiments at step a first core may receive a VRRP advertisement. Although referred to in the following discussion as being performed by a core the VRRP advertisement may be received by a Packet Engine executing on the core a Virtual IP server executing on the core a VRRP Manager executing on the core or other agent process application service daemon function routine or logic capable of maintaining a data structure. Such VRRP advertisements may be received periodically in some embodiments. For example another device may be configured to transmit a VRRP advertisement as periodic intervals responsive to expiration of a timer. At step in some embodiments the core may consult a VMAC table for an entry corresponding to the VRRP advertisement. At step the core may determine whether a dynamic entry exists corresponding to the VRRP advertisement. If not at step the core may add an entry to the VMAC table and at step may broadcast an inter core message notifying one or more other cores of the new entry. In a further embodiment at step the one or more other cores may add an entry or entries to their VMAC tables corresponding to the VRRP advertisement and responsive to receiving the inter core message.

Still referring to and in more detail upon receipt of a VRRP advertisement at step a core may consult a VMAC table at step to locate a corresponding entry. As discussed above in reference to the VMAC table may comprise an index of MAC addresses priorities IP addresses owner core identifiers and static dynamic identifiers. In some embodiments the index may further comprise a timestamp associated with each entry. In another embodiment the index may further comprise a flag or indicator associated with each entry. Accordingly responsive to determining at step of that a dynamic entry exists corresponding to the VRRP advertisement in some embodiments the core may update a timestamp associated with the entry. In another embodiment the core may set a flag or indicator associated with the entry. Such timestamps flags or indicators may be used to determine whether a VMAC entry should be flushed due to aging as discussed below.
