The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to powder actuated tools and in particular to sound suppressed stud drivers.

A stud driver may be a means to drive nails or studs into various substrates for example masonry or wood. With the nail or stud secured in the substrate one may attach or support objects on or to the nail or stud. In conventional stud drivers burning propellant may drive a hammer or piston like device into the stud or nail which is then driven into the substrate. At the final extension of the stroke or cycle the propellant may be out gassed into the environment thereby creating a loud noise. The reason for the out gassing may be to render the stud driver safe for reloading purposes.

In some environments it may be desirable to reduce the noise output of the stud driver. For example a worker may have a need to attach various payloads to surfaces without being detected. The worker may be exposed to danger if any type of sound is generated.

Past attempts to develop a sound suppressed stud driver resulted in apparatus that were not capable of penetrating the various substrates effectively. If a sound suppressed stud driver cannot penetrate the needed materials then it is not effective.

One aspect of the invention is a cartridge assembly for a sound suppressed powder actuated stud driver. The cartridge assembly may include a generally cylindrical housing having a through bore. A firing pin retainer may be disposed in the through bore and a firing pin may be disposed in the firing pin retainer. An ammunition cartridge case having a base may be disposed in the through bore with the base adjacent the firing pin retainer. A piston may be at least partially disposed in the ammunition cartridge case. A stud may be disposed in the through bore.

The firing pin may be spaced apart from an open end of the housing that is adjacent the firing pin retainer. The firing pin retainer may include a firing pin stop that limits movement of the firing pin in a direction away from the base of the ammunition cartridge case. The firing pin stop may seal the through bore when the firing pin is pressed against the firing pin stop.

The through bore may include a tapered portion that tapers from a first diameter of about an outside diameter of the ammunition cartridge case to a second diameter of about an outside diameter of the stud. Energetic material may be disposed at the base of the ammunition cartridge case.

The energetic material may be disposed in an energetic material housing that is separate from the ammunition cartridge case. After activation of the energetic material the sealing material beneath the head of the stud may form a seal at the tapered portion of the through bore.

Another aspect of the invention is a handle assembly for a sound suppressed powder actuated stud driver. The handle assembly may include a housing with an open end and a closed end and a bore extending inwardly from the open end. A firing pin may extend axially into the bore from the closed end of the housing. A first blocking pin may be movable into and out of the bore in an area near the closed end. A second blocking pin may be movable into and out of the bore in an area between the first blocking pin and the open end of the housing. A spring loaded locking pin may be movable into and out of the bore.

A handle lever may have one end engaged with the first blocking pin and an intermediate portion engaged with the second blocking pin.

A safety switch may be movable between unarmed and armed positions. In the unarmed position the safety switch may prevent movement of the first blocking pin out of the bore. The safety switch may be biased to the unarmed position.

A shield may be disposed near the open end of the housing and may extend radially outward from the housing.

A firing pin support may be disposed in the closed end of the housing. At least a portion of the firing pin may be disposed in the firing pin support.

A further aspect of the invention is a sound suppressed powder actuated stud driver. The stud driver may include a cartridge assembly and a handle assembly.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A sound suppressed stud driver SSSD may include two primary components. The two primary components may be a cartridge assembly and a handle assembly. The cartridge assembly may be a single use component. The handle assembly may be used multiple times. The cartridge assembly may include energetic material and a stud. Activation of the energetic material may cause the stud to penetrate a material. The stud may not completely exit the cartridge assembly. Thus both the stud and the cartridge assembly may be fixed to the material. The cartridge assembly remains intact with the stud and provides the support that may be needed in a particular situation.

To use the SSSD one may first load a cartridge assembly into a handle assembly. To activate the SSSD one may push or force the end of the cartridge assembly against the material to be penetrated. Such a push or force causes movement of the cartridge assembly inside the handle assembly which causes the energetic material to burn. The gases produced by the energetic material may drive a piston onto the stud thereby forcing the stud into the material to be penetrated.

A SSSD may include a cartridge assembly and a handle assembly . Cartridge assembly may include a generally cylindrical housing having a through bore . Housing may retain mechanical impact forces and internal pressures within its interior. Housing may be made of for example aluminum.

A firing pin retainer may be disposed in through bore . A firing pin may be disposed in firing pin retainer . An ammunition cartridge case may be disposed in through bore . Cartridge case may include a base . Base may be adjacent firing pin retainer . A piston may be at least partially disposed in ammunition cartridge case . A stud may be disposed in through bore .

Firing pin retainer may be fixed to housing using for example threads. Firing pin retainer may retain cartridge case within housing . Firing pin may be set back or recessed a distance C from an open end of housing . Open end of housing may be adjacent firing pin retainer . By recessing cartridge assembly firing pin in cartridge assembly housing firing pin may be protected from inadvertent impact. Inadvertent impact of cartridge assembly firing pin may cause cartridge assembly to initiate at undesired times.

Cartridge assembly may be a single use commodity. Thus cartridge assembly firing pin may also be a single use commodity. Single use firing pin in cartridge assembly may increase the life cycle of reusable handle assembly because the stress associated with firing pin is limited to cartridge assembly .

Firing pin retainer may include a firing pin stop that may limit movement of firing pin in a direction away from base of ammunition cartridge case . Firing pin stop may be an annular area of reduced inner diameter on firing pin retainer . Firing pin stop may seal through bore when firing pin is pressed against firing pin stop . Firing pin may float within the cavity of firing pin retainer . Thus firing pin may always be positioned in an ideal firing position.

As explained further below handle assembly may include its own firing pin . A firing pin in the cartridge assembly and a firing pin in the handle assembly may provide a dual firing pin arrangement. The dual firing pin arrangement may allow for a more precise impact of firing pin onto the rim of blank . The more precise impact may be a result of firing pin being tightly guided within firing pin retainer . Additionally the impact of firing pin may be controlled such that firing pin projection may not pierce or damage the blank . If blank were pierced gas may escape and create noise.

A flat portion of firing pin may provide a stop so that firing pin projection may have limited penetration. In addition the opposite side of firing pin is restricted by firing pin retainer stop . Firing pin retainer stop may prevent firing pin from exerting excessive force onto handle assembly firing pin .

A pad may be fixed to one end of housing . Pad may muffle or reduce the sound created by impact of cartridge assembly with a surface to be penetrated. Pad may be made of for example closed cell foam.

Stud may include a head . Sealing material may be disposed beneath head of stud . Sealing material may include for example a crush washer and a gasket or O ring .

Through bore may include a tapered portion . Tapered portion may taper from a first diameter A to a second diameter B. First diameter A may be about a same diameter as an outside diameter of ammunition cartridge case . Second diameter B may be about a same diameter as an outside diameter of stud .

Energetic material may be disposed at base of ammunition cartridge case . Energetic material may be disposed in an energetic material housing that may be separate from ammunition cartridge case . Energetic material and energetic material housing may be for example a commercially available .27 caliber blank. After activation of energetic material sealing material located beneath head of stud may form a seal at tapered portion of through bore .

In the past some stud drivers required that the energetic material be hand loaded. Cartridge assembly may use commercial off the shelf energetic material for example .27 caliber blanks. The gas generated by energetic material may be substantially sealed in cartridge assembly . Sealing the gas in cartridge assembly may reduce or eliminate undesired noise. Sealing the gas in cartridge assembly may reduce energy loss and increase the velocity of stud . Increasing the velocity of stud may allow penetration of materials that are difficult to penetrate.

Energetic material housing or blank containing energetic material may be seated in for example ammunition cartridge case . Ammunition cartridge case may be for example a .357 magnum cartridge case. Base of ammunition cartridge case may be modified for example enlarged to receive energetic blank . Energetic blank may seal ammunition cartridge case after activation of energetic material . A tapered portion of blank may peel back onto a joint in ammunition cartridge case .

The seal created by tapered portion may prevent any audible sound caused by gas escaping between blank and cartridge case base . On the other hand the seal created by tapered portion may not be perfect and may allow gas to slowly leak through over time. The small leakage rate may not adversely affect the gas pressure applied to piston .

At joint of cartridge case the combination of the thickness of energetic material housing and the thickness of base of cartridge case may provide a strong joint that allows a larger energetic material output prior to failure.

Gas generated by energetic material may force piston to move to the left as oriented in . Piston may include ends and . A gasket or O ring may provide a seal at end of piston . Cartridge case may form a crimp with piston . As piston moves end of piston may contact head of stud and move stud to the left as oriented in . Stud may move until sealing material and head are seated in tapered portion of through bore . Sharpened end of stud may penetrate pad and enter the adjacent material surface.

The outer circumference of housing may include a groove . Groove may be used to attach a line or cord not shown to cartridge assembly . The line or cord may be used to support a load after stud has penetrated the substrate of interest.

Turning now to handle assembly for an SSSD may include a housing . Housing may have an open end and a closed end . A bore may extend inwardly from open end of housing . The SSSD may be loaded by inserting end of cartridge assembly into open end of handle assembly .

A handle assembly firing pin may extend axially into bore from closed end of housing . A first blocking pin may be movable into and out of bore in an area near closed end . A second blocking pin may be movable into and out of bore in an area between first blocking pin and open end of housing . A spring loaded locking pin may be movable into and out of bore .

Handle assembly may include an ambidextrous safety switch . Safety switch may be connected to first blocking pin . First blocking pin may block cartridge assembly from impacting handle assembly firing pin . Safety switch may have armed and unarmed positions. Safety switch may be in the unarmed position shown in . In the unarmed position safety switch may prevent movement of first blocking pin out of bore . In the armed position safety switch may allow movement of first blocking pin out of bore . Safety switch may be biased to the unarmed position by for example a spring . In the unarmed position of safety switch cartridge assembly may not contact handle assembly firing pin .

A shield may be disposed near open end of bore . Shield may extend radially outward from housing . Shield may extend circumferentially 360 degrees. Shield may protect a user s hand. Shield may block fragments that may be generated when stud penetrates a substrate. Shield may provide equivalent protection for both right and left handed individuals.

Handle assembly may include a handle lever . One end of handle lever may be engaged with first blocking pin . Handle lever may be depressed to raise first blocking pin out of bore . Raising first blocking pin may arm the SSSD. Handle lever may be biased upwardly as shown in by a spring .

An intermediate portion of handle lever may be engaged with second blocking pin . Second blocking pin may prevent a user from arming the SSSD even with first blocking pin raised. The length of second blocking pin is such that insertion of cartridge assembly may be blocked by pin if a user has depressed handle lever before cartridge assembly is inserted in bore in handle assembly . But cartridge assembly may be inserted in bore until end of cartridge assembly contacts first blocking pin if handle lever is not depressed.

Proper insertion of cartridge assembly in bore may be confirmed by spring loaded locking pin . Spring loaded locking pin may lock into circumferential groove in cartridge assembly housing when cartridge assembly is properly positioned in bore . If locking pin is not engaged with groove then cartridge assembly may be able to slide out of bore . Movement of cartridge assembly out of bore may indicate to the user that cartridge assembly is not properly inserted in bore .

After locking pin is engaged with groove a user may activate or fire the SSSD. Placing the bottom of handle assembly housing in the palm of one s hand one s fingers may rest on top of handle lever and one s thumb may be positioned at safety switch . Safety switch may be moved to the armed position to the left in so that it no longer blocks movement of first blocking pin . Then handle lever may be depressed thereby raising first blocking pin out of bore . Then a user may strike pad against the surface to be penetrated. The force on pad may move cartridge assembly towards handle assembly firing pin . Handle assembly firing pin may contact and move cartridge assembly firing pin towards blank . Firing pin projection may contact rim of blank thereby activating energetic material . Gases produced by energetic material may cause piston to collide with stud and force stud into the substrate of interest.

Handle assembly may include a firing pin support . Firing pin support may be disposed in closed end of housing . At least a portion of firing pin may be disposed in firing pin support . Firing pin support may be useful if handle assembly is made of a low strength material for example injection molded plastic. Firing pin support may provide additional strength to handle assembly firing pin . Firing pin support may create a larger surface area for the distribution of impact energy when cartridge assembly is detonated. Firing pin support may act as a strength member and also as a safety device. Firing pin support may prevent handle assembly firing pin from becoming a projectile when cartridge assembly is detonated. Firing pin support may be for example integral with firing pin or as another example firing pin may be threaded into firing pin support .

Handle assembly firing pin may not degrade upon activation of the SSSD. The force of energetic material may be directed at cartridge assembly firing pin which may be a single use component. By transferring the damaging effects away from handle assembly to cartridge assembly the useful life of handle assembly may be increased.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
