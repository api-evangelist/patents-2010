The manufacturer s nominal zero error point MNZEP reflects a common practice of manufacturers in specifying processor ratings and operating parameters to generally assume a worst case operating situation and to set the operating clock rate or frequency at the manufacturer s nominal zero error point MNZEP. The manufacturer s nominal zero error point MNZEP may be a point selected to produce a tolerated operating error rate that is very small for example an operating error rate that is in a range of 10 9 per hour. In other instances the manufacturer s nominal zero error point MNZEP reflects a manufacturer s practice of labeling a higher speed processor chip as a lower speed processor chip. In situations an individual processor can be operated at a higher clock rate than the manufacturer s nominal zero error point MNZEP without exceeding a manufacturer s tolerated operating error rate. Without an ability to recover from timing errors resulting from a clock rate higher than the actual nominal zero error point ANZEP a computational system is subject to an increased possibility of system failure and data loss corruption due to the timing errors as clock rate further increases.

For example the first subcircuit may include any circuit block of the circuit blocks illustrated in system of .

The six subcircuits include an integer register file an ALU an ALU a load AGU an L cache and an L cache . The six subcircuit blocks are linked together as appropriate by communications links illustrated by a communication link . The illustrated embodiment also includes a power plane having a power plane voltage that powers a subcircuit block.

In an alternative embodiment one power plane may provide power to two or more subcircuit blocks. A power supply provides voltages to the power planes via couplers not illustrated as appropriate.

Continuing with the further example the system further includes an error detector operable to detect an incidence of a computational error occurring in the first subcircuit.

In operation of an embodiment the system operates with the power planes receiving a selected voltage or respectively receiving selected voltages from the power supply . For example an initial operation of the system may include the power planes each receiving a same voltage for example 1.40 volts.

If the error detector detects an incidence of a computational error occurring in Core the controller causes an increase in the voltage received by the power plane providing power to the Core . For example the voltage of the power plane may be increased to 1.20 volts.

Operation of an embodiment may be illustrated with reference to the system of . An initial voltage is supplied to the first power plane of the synchronous circuit from the power supply that includes an energy source. For example a voltage of 1.60 volts may be initially supplied to the power plane associated with the Core described in conjunction with . The energy source may include a replaceable battery and or rechargeable battery. The conservation operation decreases the voltage received at the first power plane in an increment of 0.10 volts to 1.50 volts. Decreasing the voltage received at the first power plane reduces electrical power supplied by the power supply and correspondingly reduces power drawn from an energy source coupled to the power supply. The monitoring operation monitors operations related to the Core and detects an incidence of a computational error occurring in the Core . For example the incidence may include an incidence rate of computational errors exceeding a predetermined number of computational errors per 1010 clock cycles such as 10 computational errors per 1010 clock cycles. The adjustment operation increases the voltage received at the first power plane in response to the detected computational error. The voltage received may be increased to the previous 1.60 volts from the 1.50 volts or increased to another value.

Operation of another embodiment may be illustrated with reference to the system . The conservation operation decreases the 1.60 voltage received at the first power plane in increments of 0.05 volts until a selected incidence of a computational error is detected occurring in the Core by the monitoring operation . Assuming for illustrative purposes that the predetermined incidence of computational errors is detected at a first power plane voltage of 1.45 volts then in response to the detection of the predetermined incidence of computational errors corresponding to the Core the adjustment operation increases the first power plane voltage. For example the adjustment operation may increase the first power plane voltage to 1.50 and the monitoring operation continues detection for the selected incidence of computational errors. If the selected incidence of predetermined computational errors is detected at 1.50 volts the adjustment operation may increase the first power plane voltage to 1.55. In another alternative embodiment if the monitoring operation does not detect the selected incidence of computational errors corresponding to Core the conservation operation again decreases the first power plane voltage and the operational flow is repeated.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware or software is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein may be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary.
