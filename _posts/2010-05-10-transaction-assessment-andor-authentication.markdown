Exemplary electronic signatures may comprise any information which may identify the user such as browser fingerprints computer fingerprints IP addresses geographic IP location information information associated with a payment and or a typing patterns.

In an aspect an exemplary system may uniquely identify a user using the network and payment attributes presented in the regular contexts of payment transactions. Attributes may include browser fingerprints computer fingerprints IP addresses geo IP location information information entered regularly on payment the typing pattern when entering fields in the payment information. Such information may comprise an electronic signature and may uniquely identify a user across merchants and payment networks. In some exemplary embodiments only when enough information is available to identify the user is the user known through his or her electronic signature.

In an aspect an exemplary method may include collecting the history data of charges entered information and summary data on those transactions being accepted or rejected to build a database that becomes part of an electronic signature for a user.

In an aspect an exemplary method may include using hashes of attributes collected in a transaction that can be stored at a central location and or may be used in a positive system to uniquely identify known users to a collection of merchants and payment networks. The hashes may not be reversed to extract personal information which may allow cooperation between merchants and payment entities without compromising customer information.

In an aspect an exemplary method may include explicitly identifying a user on first use of a payment instrument for the purpose of collecting an electronic signature for use in subsequent network transactions.

In an aspect an exemplary method may include a check of an electronic signature on a transaction for the purpose of detecting whether the user is the same or not as a requirement for acceptance of a card not present transaction.

The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description and drawings are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the figures may be arranged substituted combined and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated and make part of this disclosure.

The present disclosure relates inter alia to methods and systems associated with transaction assessment and or authentication and more particularly to assessing and or authenticating transactions to identify fraudulent payments.

The present disclosure contemplates that transaction fraud is becoming more prevalent due in large part to the Internet. For example transaction frauds may include fraudulent use of payment instruments such as credit cards debit cards and other similar instruments. Some fraud check systems maintain lists of known bad cards bad addresses and or bad computer system fingerprints which may be referred to as black lists. Further some fraud check systems perform analytics with the bad cards bad addresses and or bad computer system fingerprints to determine whether a given transaction appears legitimate. Some of these fraud check systems also determine a risk associated with a transaction.

Some exemplary embodiments according to the present disclosure may utilize information associated with a user to develop and or maintain an association between a user and a payment instrument. In some exemplary embodiments transaction assessment and or authentication systems and methods may be configured to collect information associated with a user of a payment instrument and or to compare such newly collected information with previously collected information. Based at least in part upon the comparison of the previously collected information and the newly collected information some exemplary systems and methods may be configured to determine whether the user is associated with the presented payment instrument. Some exemplary embodiments may be configured to maintain all or part of the information related to users transactions over time which may increase the level of trust in an identity matching scheme.

Some exemplary embodiments may utilize data that may be collected in transactions using Internet online payment systems for online merchants. For example data associated with a transaction may be collected to build a representation of the user who is associated with the payment instrument used in the transaction. In some exemplary embodiments data associated with attributes that can be seen in the network and or the transaction that may be associated with and or may identify a user may be analyzed and or used to create an electronic signature of the user. Exemplary attributes include but are not limited to browser fingerprints computer fingerprints IP addresses geographic IP location information information associated with a payment and or a typing pattern when entering data in fields related to the payment. Browser fingerprints may include attributes associated with an individual s browser that may be extracted using standard interfaces. For example browser fingerprints may include characteristics such as user agent includes browser and operating system screen resolution software plug ins in a manageable state time zone system language whether Java is enabled whether cookies are enabled sites visited and or IP address. The present disclosure contemplates that matching browser fingerprint characteristics in a subsequent interaction with those collected during a prior interaction may indicate a high probability that the same browser was used in both the prior and subsequent interactions.

Some exemplary computer fingerprints may allow a determine of whether a physical machine is the same as one that has been seen in the past. Computer fingerprints may include for example processor characteristics e.g. model number version speed cache size serial number etc. memory size of the machine values that are loaded at key locations values of the registry of the loaded operating system Ethernet MAC media access control address raw networking and network information e.g. configuration parameters loaded programs and or log files. Some exemplary embodiments may utilize performance on specified benchmark program fragments such as by measuring the performance of a program that includes different characteristics including input output and CPU central processing unit speed. Such an approach may take into account the other processes running on a user s machine the amount of memory etc. and it may provide reproducible results so that it may act as a part of a fingerprint. Example information associated with a payment may include behaviors observed on entered information e.g. typing rhythms billing addresses entered cards used passwords or PINs stored and or requested Zip code full name entered and or loaded verses empty fields on entering information for example the browser may have the previously entered values from the last instance of the user . This can be seen to be entered by the browser rather than typing by the speed of entry of the characters. In some exemplary embodiments the electronic signature may uniquely identify the user at the same merchant in future transactions and or at other merchants where the same attributes can be seen.

In some exemplary embodiments when a transaction is presented by a user to a merchant data related to the user s electronic signature may be collected. The newly collected electronic signature data may be compared to previously collected electronic signature data associated with that user to determine whether or not the newly collected electronic signature correlates with the previously collected electronic signature. If the newly collected electronic signature correlates with the previously collected electronic signature then it may be assumed that the user has been identified. If the newly collected electronic signature does not correlate with the previously collected electronic signature then it may be assumed that the user in the present transaction is not the same user who participated in previous transactions. Thus by associating a particular payment instrument with a known user e.g. by identifying the user by his or her electronic signature it may be determined whether or not the payment instrument presented in a particular transaction is known to belong to the user who is presenting the payment instrument.

In some exemplary embodiments a lack of correlation between the newly collected electronic signature and the previously collected electronic signature may be used to identify transactions which may merit further assessment. For example if the newly collected electronic signature correlates with a known previously collected electronic signature of a different user e.g. a user other than the user involved in the transaction then the transaction may be flagged for further assessment such as further determination of whether or not fraud is involved or whether additional fraud checks need to be performed.

The present disclosure contemplates that the notion of using an electronic signature associated with a user to identify the user in a payment network may be aided by the standardization of World Wide Web interfaces. Merchant payment interfaces often utilize standard World Wide Web technology to provide user catalogs and payment collection. This may include the input of credit card and or other payment information through applications running on users computers or as browser applications. Some exemplary embodiments according to the present disclosure may be configured to collect certain pieces of information for the purpose of identifying the user who is behind the payment instrument. Some of these pieces of information are not necessarily related to the transaction but may instead relate to characteristics of the user s computer environment and or network sessions. For example characteristics of the user s computer environment may include browser fingerprint information and or typing characteristics of the user. Characteristics of the network sessions may include IP address whether or not the user is coming from a known location associated with the user and or whether or not the user is utilizing a network proxy. The whole collection of the information or parts thereof may provide a unique user electronic signature. Such an electronic signature may allow a determination of whether a particular user is associated with a particular payment instrument they are presenting.

As illustrated in an exemplary transaction assessment and authentication environment may include a merchant submitting information pertaining to a transaction to a transaction assessment and authentication system . System may include a positive user ID module which may employ an electronic signature database and or authentication services to establish a user ID . Users who are not positively identified e g unknown users may be subjected to one or more third party fraud detection processes such as fraud model and or black listing analyses . Users who are positively identified e.g. verified users and or unknown users who have undergone third party fraud detection processes may be evaluated under a fraud policy and system may provide an accept or reject output associated with the user.

Some exemplary embodiments may be configured to utilize electronic signatures to identify users or as a common component in the identification of users. In some exemplary embodiments this may reduce or eliminate dependence upon user supplied information to identify users. In some exemplary embodiments the actual underlying data in an electronic signature may be less important than correlation between aspects of a newly collected electronic signature and a previously collected electronic signature.

Some exemplary embodiments may reduce the likelihood that a user s identity may be hidden. For example some exemplary embodiments may asses the degree of correlation of a newly collected electronic signature with a previously collected electronic signature. The degree of correlation may be evaluated to determine whether such electronic signatures uniquely identify the user. If so the electronic signature may be considered to be positive identification of the user in the transaction.

Some exemplary embodiments may use any technology to help identify a user at their computer or site using identifying attributes and or data. Instead of or in addition to using technologies to generate blacklists or negative lists of users with bad payment credentials some exemplary embodiment may use attributes to help identify the user in different contexts. The present disclosure contemplates that the attributes may not necessarily identify the user completely. Cryptographic techniques may be used to store encrypted information that may be transmitted by the user. The encrypted information may assist a merchant in determining the identification of a consumer user using a payment instrument.

As illustrated in some exemplary transaction assessment and authentication methods may include cryptographic hashing and or encryption of the information. For example newly collected electronic signature information such as user name user address geographic location credit card data and or other information may be run through a hash operation and or encryption operation prior to conducting identity matching to evaluate the correlation with a previously collected electronic signature such as from an electronic signature database . In some exemplary embodiments the original information run through the hash and or encryption operations may not be readily obtained from the hashed and or encrypted result. In such embodiments the correlation of the newly collected electronic signature and the previously collected electronic signature may be performed on hashed and or encrypted data. Thus although the actual information making up the electronic signature may not be retrievable e.g. only hashed and or encrypted data may be transmitted assessment of correlation e.g. matching of attributes may be performed. For example while the geographic location of a user may not be retrievable from the hash of the geographic location data the newly obtained hash of the user s geographic location may be compared to a previously collected hash of the user s geographic location. If the hashes match then the newly collected and previously collected geographic locations correlate.

In some exemplary embodiments using hashed and or encrypted data may allow private user data to be transmitted across the internet only in hashed and or encrypted form which may provide privacy advantages. In some exemplary embodiments using hashed and or encrypted data may allow a plurality of merchants or other parties to cooperate to reduce fraudulent transaction without divulging confidential customer information. For example merchants or other parties may contribute hashed and or encrypted information comprising user electronic signatures which may be used by other parties for transaction assessment through matching. However because the information is hashed and or encrypted the underlying information may not be retrievable.

Some exemplary embodiments may determine whether a payment instrument belongs to a user based on network information associated with the user. For example network information associated with the user may include the network provider whether the IP address is consistent with the user s known IP address the geographical proximity of the address registered with a payment instrument e.g. credit card or payment card and the IP address as determined by an IP to geo location service whether or not the user is utilizing a proxy or known bad set of IP locations as determined by a service or black list and or whether the IP address is associated with a service provider who was associated with the user in past transactions. In this manner some exemplary embodiments may enable a merchant to accurately assess whether a payment instrument such as a credit card belongs to the user of the payment instrument or not.

Some exemplary embodiments may address a growing problem with on line and or Internet transaction payments. For example when a merchant receives a user request to charge a credit card it may be beneficial to determine whether to accept the request based on the information presented by the user. In the case of stolen credit cards the information about the user may be stolen at the same time along with the physical and or virtual credit card information. This information may include a name address phone number and other pieces of billing and or personally identifiable information. Since each merchant may verify their own customer s data the personal data utilized for this kind of fraudulent activity may be replicated over and over. Some exemplary embodiments may reduce problems associated with the loss of that information and verification by the merchant. For example if the system detects that a different user is using a known payment instrument it may alert certain parties of the possibility of identity theft. By establishing the user s identity prior to processing the transaction some exemplary embodiments may allow Internet payments to approach card present situations in terms of fraud prevention and trustworthiness.

In some exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein may assist merchants in determining whether they should accept a credit card payment based on whether the user making the payment owns the credit card. This may provide confidence and or information to the merchant that the user owns the credit card. Such information may be considered by the merchant before processing the credit card payment. Some exemplary embodiments may reduce the differences between transactions where the credit card is present card present transaction and transactions where the credit is not present card not present transactions since it may help establish that the user actually owns the credit card in an analogous way to clerk asking a person for drivers license and or other credentials by matching the name and or other information on the credit card with the license information. This may be a useful tool for all involved parties since it tends to provide proof that a user owned the credit card presented the credit card to the merchant and that the merchant performed the actual fraud checks. This may be better than in many card present cases as a merchant may not be able perform the required identity checks and there may be no record of whether they were performed.

Some exemplary embodiments may determine whether the payment requesting user is the same user who actually owns the card instead of asking if a user s credentials are bad e.g. whether they are on a blocked list or are coming from known bad computer systems etc. . This may be accomplished using much of the same data. But the data may be transmitted to the authentication system to determine whether it is the same data that has been associated with the use of the card on an authentication network. In this manner the authentication system may help determine whether it is the user that actually owns the payment instrument as opposed to merely whether the transaction may be risky . This may provide much better user authentication than the explicit password based authentication methods that are used in some systems today. Some exemplary embodiments may produce a trust level or score indicating how close the user requesting a current payment is to the known users of the card. A trust score may weight matching elements to provide a high score for matching of all elements and a very low or medium score for instances in which there are partially matching or non matching elements.

In some exemplary embodiments a trust score may be calculated as follows. A set of candidate users may be identified base on known existing good users of the payment instrument presented known existing users of the computer from which the payment request is being made users who have made purchases through the merchant account currently requesting payment users sharing the same email address and or other criteria that find candidate users with a reasonable probability of matching the user requesting payment. For each of the candidate users the attributes of the current payment request may be compared with the attributes of the candidate user to determine which candidate user if any is best matched by the current payment request. In some exemplary embodiments the attributes may include user name user billing address user shipping address user phone numbers mobile work home fax etc. user typing rhythms email address merchant account name. For purposes of matching each of these attributes may be given a weight that reflects how strongly the presence of the attribute identifies the user. An exemplary table of user attribute weights follows 

An overall match score may be calculated for each of the candidate users as follows. The weights of all of the attributes that matched may be summed and designated matchWeight. The weights of all of the attributes that did not match may be summed and designated missWeight. The weights of all of the attributes of the candidate user may be summed and designated maxPossible. The weights of all of the attributes of the candidate user that were not present in the current payment request may be summed and designated notInRequest. 

In some exemplary embodiments the match score may be given by the following expression matchWeight missWeight 2 notInRequest 1000 maxPossible

In some exemplary embodiments individual known cards computers and users within the authentication system may have individual reputation scores that may be determined by the history of payments involving that entity. For example a user that has been involved in many successful transactions over a long period of time none of which have been subsequently reversed due to fraud may have a high reputation score. Similarly a user that has been the subject of fraudulent transaction reversals e.g. chargebacks may have a low reputation score.

The trust score of the user that is requesting payment may be a function of the user match score the reputation score of the user payment instrument and computer involved in the payment request and or the strength of any existing relationships between the payment instrument and computer.

The following exemplary algorithm illustrates how these inputs can be used to calculate a trust score for the payment requesting user 

A trust score may be used for example to determine how much scrutiny to apply to the transaction from a fraud analysis perspective. For example if a user s trust score is VERY GOOD or GOOD then only limited resources may to be applied to this user s transaction. Similarly if a user s trust score is BAD then the transaction may be rejected without further analysis. However if a user s trust score is SUSPICIOUS then this may be a transaction that deserves closer inspection.

In some exemplary embodiments accumulating the transactions performed by users may improve the accuracy of these scores over time.

Some exemplary embodiments may reduce problems associated with stolen credit cards used on the Internet e.g. when a user presents a credit card to a merchant the merchant may ask if the user owns the credit card and if not then merchant must perform more checks to determine if the credit card is stolen . If the user is known to the authentication system then the merchant may know that the credit card is being used legitimately. If the user is not known to the authentication system then the merchant may make a separate determination of the riskiness of the transaction e.g. by checking black lists . Thus some exemplary embodiments may reduce the frequency of checking the black lists in many cases since most transactions are in fact legitimate.

In some exemplary embodiments the authentication system may operate in a computer network environment as follows. The merchant may embed a code in their applications which may take data from the user s environment and pass it across to the authentication system. For example such data from the user s environment may include the same data as the browser fingerprint as described above. In the user s browser an encrypted cookie may store any data that is passed to the authentication system. The encrypted cookie may also store user s information that has been previously known. In one embodiment the user may not see the data as it may only be a credential that gets transmitted to the authentication system. Some exemplary embodiments may compare the previous values with the values that are passed across in the active session. If an application operates outside of the browser the routines may use the same protocol but assemble their own cookie outside of the browser cookie facilities and cache.

Further in some exemplary embodiments a central server may receive requests from merchants. An application programming interface API may send the cookie together with the network information for the user. This may include all the components of the API which may be gathered by the embedded code. When the user presents the information to the authentication system through the API they may include the cookie which may include past behavior and or local information . If information in the cookie does not match the current information then a message may be provided that the user cannot be identified and or authenticated. In such a case a user may be identified by the authentication system by a number of different methods. The methods may lead to the same or similar corroborating information.

In some exemplary embodiments transactions may occur with merchants issuers and or any entity that the user might want to present the payment instrument to. When a user presents a payment instrument to a merchant for example the merchant may request assistance from the authentication system to determine whether the user is the same user who has used the payment instrument in the past. In contacting the authentication system the user may transmit data associated with the user s computer system and or network connection including an IP address for example . The authentication system may utilize this data to make a determination as to whether the user is the same user who has used the same payment instrument in the past.

In some exemplary embodiments the payment instrument issuer may set up a policy so that when a user presents the payment instrument a check may be performed to confirm that the user s information matches the policy for the user identified as owning the payment instrument. Otherwise the user may be deemed not authenticated.

In some exemplary embodiments a merchant for example may collect data from the connection according to a policy that may be provided by the central authority. The user may not know what information to collect nor may they give any information about themselves except network information that is being transmitted and information that may be gathered from the network connection. The authentication system may analyze whether the payment instrument information is coming from the user or another entity. If the merchant has implemented authentication system algorithms for identifying the user then it may be determined with near certainty that it is the user. Otherwise a result may be returned that indicates that positive identification of the user cannot be determined. Future transactions may then be known with relative certainty.

In some exemplary embodiments a set of APIs may collect information related to the behavior of the user involved with the transaction. This may be deemed a fingerprint of the user. The fingerprint may be used as part of the electronic signature of the user.

In some exemplary embodiments when a merchant is asked to accept payment for a transaction they may ask the authentication system whether this is the same user as defined by the issuer authority for the payment instrument. The merchant may not make any determination of whether the payment should be taken. Instead the authentication system may determine whether the user owns the payment instrument and if the payment should be accepted. Based at least in part on the user s information including network information for example the decision may be made whether this is the same user that owns this payment instrument as has been seen in the past on the Internet. If the user has registered with the payment instrument issuer the determination of whether the user is the actual owner of the credential may be easily effectuated. The merchant may not know anything about the user beyond what they know through accepting the payment instrument. There is no identity of the user that is transmitted around the authentication system. Thus some exemplary embodiments may maintain privacy of all users in the system while verifying their ownership of their payment credentials through matching their electronic signatures.

In some exemplary embodiments a method to determine the identity of a user through use of network signatures may be provided. An exemplary network signature may include information known about the browser or computer environment the IP address networking locations that the user is known to come from and or the total history of the user s behavior. The network signature for a user may provide a unique identity in various contexts. This method may include weighing components of the network characteristics gathered through a user s activity on the Internet.

In some exemplary embodiments the algorithm to calculate a trust score for a payment requesting user described above may be adapted to identify the user via their network characteristics by substituting attributes of the user s network signature for user attributes. An exemplary table of network characteristic attribute weights follows 

Such a method may provide a proof of identity at the time of a transaction. In some exemplary embodiments the method may be implemented in an embedded Java applet.

In some exemplary embodiments the authentication system and or method may provide payment integration with security features. Such embodiments may provide details and or reports related to transactions and may correlate security information with user data.

In some exemplary embodiments an authentication system may provide fraud checks together with transaction data for a user. This may include a set of APIs that allow a merchant to plug in the payment instruments and or accounts together with order information and or payment information. Such a system may provide analytics about where users are from which payment methods they typically use among others.

In some exemplary embodiments a dynamic set of checks may uniquely identify a user across network identities. A network identity may be provided through the network signature. The network signature may be defined by the set of network attributes which may comprise the user s identity from the point of view of the merchant. For example network attributes may include the IP addresses that the user has come from the browser or computer information sampled in the application and or the cookie that indicates the same computer or browser has visited the Web site or merchant before.

In some exemplary embodiments an authentication system may include a test to register the user to a new computer based on a required set of credentials. This may also bind the network signature to another computer and or another network identity. In some exemplary embodiments multiple payment methods may be accepted for the same network identity.

In some exemplary embodiments the merchant computer system user computer system and or server system s may be in communication with each other directly or via network connections such as the Internet an intranet or other network . The user information including network information for example may be transmitted to the user information database s for storage.

In some exemplary embodiments an electronic commerce payment instrument verification system and or method may use unique attributes of computers e.g. such as is described in the cookie and network signature above and or prior purchasing behavior e.g. such as the transaction list and transactions results that have been seen for the user associated with a payment instrument to determine whether a person attempting to use the payment instrument is truly its owner. Some exemplary embodiments may include one or more servers configured to receive payment requests from merchant computer systems where the servers and associated software may be configured to verify the identity of the payment instrument user prior to allowing the payment to be made to the merchant. For example the servers may receive one or more pieces of information which may be encrypted from the user s computer to verify the location of the computer using the network address or other network characteristics. The servers may be configured to determine the degree to which the user s prior purchasing behavior correlates with the requested transaction. For example the servers may compare the network address es used in the past to determine whether the there is a correlation between the current transaction and the previous transaction s . Based at least in part upon correlation and or matching information between the previously collected data and the newly collected data a transaction may be authorized.

Some exemplary embodiments may include a transaction assessment and authentication system that relies upon an independent combination of an electronic signature and prior purchasing behavior to deny or allow use of a payment instrument in a transaction. For example such a system may utilize one or more cookies on the user s computer in its assessment and authentication. Similarly some exemplary methods may include evaluating a combination of an electronic signature which may include one or more cookies and prior purchasing behavior e.g. such as the transactions attempts and the results returned by the payment processor or gateway to deny or allow use of a payment instrument in a transaction.

To provide additional context for various aspects of the present invention the following discussion is intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the various aspects of the invention may be implemented.

The interface for external drive implementations includes at least one or both of Universal Serial Bus USB and IEEE 1394 interface technologies.

The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of data data structures computer executable instructions and so forth. For the computer the drives and media accommodate the storage of any data in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer readable media above refers to a HDD a removable magnetic diskette and a removable optical media such as a CD or DVD it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of media which are readable by a computer such as zip drives magnetic cassettes flash memory cards cartridges and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment and further that any such media may contain computer executable instructions for performing the methods of the invention.

A number of program modules may be stored in the drives and RAM including an operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data. All or portions of the operating system applications modules and or data may also be cached in the RAM. It is appreciated that the invention may be implemented with various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems.

It is also within the scope of the disclosure that a user may enter commands and information into the computer through one or more wired wireless input devices for example a touch screen a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse. Other input devices may include a microphone functioning in association with appropriate language processing recognition software as know to those of ordinary skill in the technology an IR remote control a joystick a game pad a stylus pen or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through an input device interface that is coupled to the system bus but may be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port an IEEE 1394 serial port a game port a USB port an IR interface etc.

The system may include a communication framework e.g. a global communication network such as the Internet that may be employed to facilitate communications between the client s and the server s .

Some exemplary embodiments of the invention may accumulate results from transactions over time such as charge backs and refunds. This information may help in assessing the fraud score of a transaction requested by the user. For example a lower fraud score would result from knowledge that this user does regular charge backs then merchants can apply their anti fraud policy to determine whether the transaction would be accepted.

Some exemplary embodiments may be configured to associate a credit card or another payment instrument with more than one user as in a family situation. Building a graph connecting multiple users to the devices locations and payment instruments may also affect the fraud score of a transaction. A graph may associate different entities through having common key attributes that may uniquely identify a user. For example if two users share the same browser or PC fingerprint then the graph may identify those two users as associated by sharing the browser or fingerprint. The same may apply for IP address credit card number or billing address for example.

In some exemplary embodiments use of a payment instrument through a known trusted source e.g. certain well known and trusted online retailers may establish a base reputation for a user with an electronic signature for a merchant or collection of merchants not affiliated with the trusted source. For example recognizing the user s use of the trusted source for a transaction may provide an increased level of confidence that the user is known to accurately to the service.
