The present invention relates generally to the field of financial resource management inventory control and online purchasing transactions between customers retailers suppliers and wholesalers. More particularly the present invention relates to a computerized system and method for paralleling and simulating an existing network of retailer supplier and wholesaler organizations wherein the system has the capability of instantaneously generating plotting and updating an optimal price and shipping cost trajectory between two geographic locations to enable an end user to locate the lowest FOB C F and CDF shipping costs for goods and services.

The system manages production rates for suppliers by purchasing at optimal cost order quantities and shipping at maximized discount rates. By coordinating the resources of multiple customers through common suppliers and financial institutions the system takes advantage of economies of scale to reduce transactional service charges and obtain the best supplier price for the consumer.

The system is comprised of computers configured linked and otherwise arranged to form a distributed Simulation Network of computers subdivided into multiple hierarchical neural like subcomponents having neural elements residing at remote sites hereinafter referred as computer network system as used in the U.S. Pat. No. 7 058 601 claim language.

With the advent of the Internet and related technologies electronic commerce and related online services has become one of the fast growing segments of the economy. Organizational data networks gather validate verify and exchange end user information in an effort to understand for example the kinds of products services and qualities consumers value most and how and why they make such determinations.

With regard to the electronic trade or e Trade industry there have long been individual computers loaded with programs for performing online purchasing inventory control and accounting functions to manage resources. Such systems rely upon the processing power and data within the single stand alone computer. A problem with these single computer applications has been that more processing power and data access capability are needed as well as reduced bandwidth usage coupled with web and virtual world access.

Another related problem is that each transaction must be paid in full before goods and services are shipped which particularly complicates matters for consumers who must obtain funds through financial institutions. Solutions to these problems are presented in the published doctoral dissertation of the present inventor entitled hereinafter referred as the doctorial dissertation submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at California Coast University in November of 1999 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Note from related art that was incorporated by reference that uses the commercial name of the tiers the summit tier is also known as the Managerial Pyramid Switch or MPS the middleware tier is also known as the Synergy Interface Switch or SIS and the Lower Tier is also known as Team Work Switch or TWS.

The supercomputer can have a plurality of switches per tier and each tier is programmed with artificial intelligence to make proactive decisions and purchase merchandise or update the its own database with the up to date latest information derived from the simulation environment that continuously replicates an echo of the environment. E.g. the simulation environment for the XCommerce is the Internet and it is updated by web crawlers as the find new relevant and significant information as per Z Price optimal inventories.

The present invention overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the prior art and accomplishes the above stated objectives as well as others as may be determined by a fair reading and interpretation of the entire specification.

Computer Network System The computer network system consists of a plurality of nodes where each one is programmed with Artificial Intelligence to perform predefined ad hoc tasks that are logistical rationalized based on the current conditions of the environment. The computer network system is synonymous with the Superset U . The cluster is divided into three geospatial tiers a Global b Regional and c Local. Each tier has the following functions 

Computer Network System Nodes All nodes work collectively and independently from each other and still simultaneously and in parallel analyze evaluate gather and process information from the environment in real time. From incipiency upon receiving the fuzzy logic piece of information that triggers a new task or update pending activities. Each node is assigned to a Superset I Set I J or Subset I J K cluster tier and is assigned to geospatial domains X or global Y or regional and Z local to create sub clusters Elements I J K X Y Z that help to build the managerial hierarchy as follows 

Managerial Hierarchy The Summit Tier coordinates Business Intelligence and Invoicing databases via the Internet that allows users to have access to their information in real time. The Middleware Tier manages UCommerce warehouses based on geographical area. The Lower Tier controls a plurality of points of presence belonging to 3party suppliers wholesalers and retailers and collectively constitutes the workhorse of the system.

Node Synchronization and Buffer Resources Every predefined cycle each node synchronizes the latest inventory and optimizes via artificial intelligence programming its organizational management logistics. Nodes can request to members of the same group any excess buffer resources to complete a task using vertical and lateral synergy. Parent nodes can use their chain of command to coordinate the resources of their subordinates to complete a task. Members of different regional clusters can synergistically collaborate to process tasks. Each node is able to replace and perform the organizational task of at least one node so that collectively the computer network system engulfs a global supplier.

Eliminates the Spaghetti Phenomena The computer network system has specialized interaction means with the environment to gather distill analyze and then standardize and convert the raw information into primed lingua franca data which in turn is quantified qualified organized and transformed so that Information Entropy is achieved and thus removes the chaos and anarchy or Spaghetti Phenomena .

Primes Vector CDR Lingua franca messages are primed by the computer network system as single version of the truth Vector CDR. And contain the vector trajectory and all pertinent transactional segments information. Prior art send all the transactional segments to a centralized billing data warehouse that match merges all the transactional components and then correlates the information into a single version of the truth billing entity. Whereas the computer network system uses artificial intelligence programming to assign a hierarchical owner and then plots circuit by circuit the vector trajectory. And then activates all relevant nodes to the transaction so that nodes can communicate amongst themselves via forward and reward chaining. And send all the dynamic and fixed cost to hierarchical owner so it can match merge and then correlate a single version of the truth billing entity absent of a centralized billing data warehouse.

Interact with the Human Resources The human resources of the organization proactively can use business intelligence software to send parameters to the computer network system. This enables individuals to directly control their own network and then send command instructions with the latest conditions of the environment so the computer network system can optimally analyze coordinate prioritize and synchronize throughput.

Computer Network System has three Tiers of Nodes Middleware and Summit tier nodes perform data warehouse functions and are programmed to monitor and control their chains of command. They act as virtual simulation of the organization. Lower tier nodes are designed to remove redundancy geographically distribute activities and then correlate and update information.

Avoids Taxing the Throughput The computer network system monitors the limited resources and capacities of the network to avoid taxing available throughput in real time. Each node can create plot and update purchase orders as soon as new relevant messages from the environment are detected.

Uses Synergy to Maximize Throughput Upon receiving environment command instructions each node can manage and organize the flow of information of their subordinates from predefined point A to point B routes to avoid clogs and saturation. Each node via synergy attempts to maximize throughput and assign prioritize and shares with other nodes that have substantial buffer resources since unused resources are considered waste which is one the confounding variable that is directly related in creating the Spaghetti Phenomena .

Analyzes Network Traffic Network traffic is analyzed by tier as the informational traffic is measured based on the latest command instructions and known routing throughput limitations of each given domain. The summit nodes of each tier performs the non obvious task of removing complexity in order to be a real time system by eliminating data redundancy filtering quantifying qualifying data as good or garbage and minimizing waste before beginning to transmit the data through the managerial hierarchy system.

Computer Network System Reaches Informational Entropy Nodes are programmed to remove the Spaghetti Phenomena at the point of attack that is one transaction at a time so that the computer network system can reach Informational Entropy at the organizational level which is a necessary condition to be considered a real time invention.

Computer Network System Stabilize the Flow of Information Summit and Middleware nodes stabilize the flow of information concerning financial conditions inventories shipping costs and tariffs required for billing and update the XLDB database with trending statistics that in turn are used to optimize resources and available bandwidth. Each node is programmed to be autonomous and through means of the managerial hierarchical synergy can work in parallel with others nodes to work as a single unit. Each node processes network information and then simulate plot map tract and vector each message to create a virtual instance of the organizational environment.

Computer Network System is a Real Time System Once the Spaghetti Phenomena is eliminated Informational Entropy is achieved and thus a state of balance harmony and proportion exists. The computer network system distributed configuration removes the need for a central mainframe. Consequently a real time solution consists of synergistically synchronizing all the computer network system functions.

Computer Network System Evaluates Network Resources Each node has its own location identification means and must be assigned to one geospatial specific domain cluster such as local regional or global. Every single activity and purchase order is processed in parallel starting from the point of origin and ending at the point of destination. The computer network system then rearward chains the routing vector information through the simulation network to the point of origin. The computer network system analyzes and evaluates the best usage of network resources as follows 

XCommerce Server Side Supercomputer XCommerce is a method based on UCommerce that simulates the entire superset of potential valid keyword regular expression requests construed during an Internet browser search and converting the results set into a vector based statistical data that enable efficient and accurate searching without requiring existing Browser based search engine supercomputer capabilities. XCommerce is the server side supercomputer that simulates standardizes and transforms the Internet into a plurality of concurrently working environment using a Managerial hierarchical method of indexing and searching web pages the following 

1 Managerial Hierarchical Relationship Indexing a request is broken down into keywords and clusters and then converted into a search pattern that optimally minimizes the quantity of valid and visible web pages with regards to a particular search.

2 Determining what is Relevant and Irrelevant Keyword and Cluster serve as the basis of each Managerial Hierarchical Relationship Index to analyze and distill what is relevant and irrelevant. Irrelevant web pages are discarded completely from analysis.

3 Partition the Environment into Blocks the environment is subdivided into a plurality of blocks that are arranged based on a three Managerial Hierarchical levels as follows 

4 Identifies Static Search Patterns the computer network system determines if the search pattern already exist and if yes obtains the top n web pages from the databases.

6 Finds New Search Patterns XCommerce stores new search pattern and its associate top n web pages into the database.

Any nodes can perform synergy lateral and vertical to finish pending tasks with unused bandwidth allowing components based on specified protocols to share the resources of lesser taxed subordinates group members or their parents. The supplier system interacts with the consumer preferably via the Internet.

In essence the summit tier updates the latest inventory information relating to supply whereas the nodes match merge multiple end user requests taking advantage of economies of scale to purchase goods at the lowest prices. Alternatively using end user criteria each node accommodates particular needs and offers door to door service with domestic and international rush shipping options.

Continentally distributed geographic nodes update the inventory of each warehouse as physical inventory is received other nodes and link directly to the provisioning of the organization they are monitoring. Specifically some nodes interact with suppliers while other nodes interact with wholesalers and still other nodes interact with retailers. When a supplier has a complex infrastructure that also includes wholesalers and retailers in their distribution chain the supplier nodes work in unison with wholesaler nodes and retailer nodes to more accurately reflect global regional and local territorial restrictions. The supplier system can purchase merchandise based upon anticipated demands of its end users and stock its U Commerce warehouse accordingly. This available stock is known as inventory in hand and is not subject to brand territorial restriction since each continental or regional U Commerce warehouse can barter with inventory between each other.

The U Commerce warehouse dramatically reduces end user delivery time cost and availability delays. The merchandise is only available when domestic and or international rush shipping is requested. For standard C F shipments the end user request is consolidated by the summit tier. The nodes when analyzing and end user request uses several supplier nodes inventory availability price and time of delivery. The ultimate decision maker is the end user.

Collectively each node gathers information from the environment elements that they monitor and work together to keep the supplier system data synchronized and up to date in real time. The summit tier U Commerce warehouse supplier wholesalers and retailers continuously scan and analyze the environment and logically eliminate redundant data then review end user needs and notify the computer network system nodes that in turn disseminate information to end users.

In this manner the node was able to find the best price without having to chain thousands of requests and responses that clog the system as is inherent with a centralized system. In sharp contrast HIVE due to its distributed tier architecture geospatial configuration and hierarchical arrangement of each node is able to perform pre calculated inventory calculations design to minimize bandwidth usage and allow the system to always work at its maximal rated capacity.

E.g. we will assume the following a the end user has allowed enough time for all regional wholesalers to satisfy the request with the allotted time and b the wholesale prices are lower than retail prices. Each node in charge of the transaction performs the following steps 

UCommerce 2010 the artificial intelligence programming must anticipate demand and stock its warehouses with optimal quantities of inventory in hand so that the lowest delay UCommerce warehouse also has the lowest P U at all times.

Nevertheless UCommerce 2010 the artificial intelligence programming must anticipate demand and must buy using economies of scale to always have the lowest delay warehouses with ample inventory in hand and the best P U.

In the spirit of supply side economics end users collectively constitute demand and the supplier system tries to identify critical path condition to delivery if goods produced by manufacturers constitute supply. The system by using the Intelligent Inventory Delivery method has access to the information of all the inventory of each node. U Commerce reviews multiple common denominator orders with the same tandem or destination to make economies of scale type purchase lowering the overall cost to the consumer. As the system gathers changes in the environment with regard to supply the appropriate retail wholesaler and or supplier node information gets updated.

For a vague KEYWORD search the system assumes that a large number of valid hits implicitly exists such as 10 000 000 000 making the value of the response meaningless.

For a vague KEYWORD search the system associates them to a Simple Pyramid Structure search that filters down the magnitude of vagueness by a factor of 10 000. The process of improving the Informational Entropy begins by filtering the vague KEYWORD search by reading comparing validating the semantic structure of the content of the all the responses and not just the highest page ranks. The supplier system measures the value of the content by comparing the quantity and quality of Simple Joins Blocks Ceiling and Walls which are another name for collections of words and grammatical rules that are used to write properly in a given language.

For a concise KEYWORD search the system assumes that a medium number of valid hits implicitly exists such as 1 000 000 making the value of the response virtually meaningless. For a concise KEYWORD search the system associates them to a Hybrid Pyramid Structure search that filters down the magnitude of vagueness by a factor of 100. The process of improving the Informational Entropy continues by filtering the concise KEYWORD search by further reading comparing validating the semantic structure with their association to higher magnitude words. The supplier system further measures the value of the content by comparing the quantity and quality of Hybrid Joins Blocks Ceiling and Walls which consists of less common word collections geospatial data antonyms and synonyms.

For a precise KEYWORD search the system assumes that a small number of valid hits implicitly exists such as 10 000 making the value of the response discrete. For a precise KEYWORD search the system associates them to a Complex Pyramid Structure search that filters down the magnitude of vagueness by a factor of 100. The process of improving the Informational Entropy continues by filtering the precise KEYWORD search by further reading comparing validating the semantic structure with their association to higher magnitude words. The supplier system further measures the value of the content by comparing the quantity and quality of Complex Joins Blocks Ceiling and Walls also analyzes all the HTML information and associated links to make sure the content is not a spam or viral contamination. Then system finds the optimal KEYWORD search by using the content page and security value achieve Informational Entropy and derive the top 10 most satisfying results.

The condensed and simplified to from related art show the basic concepts that enable the Simulation Network to be partitioned into three tiers of switches where each switch is an independent component of the overall Simulation Network and collectively work together as a single Super Switch Supercomputer that is able to process standardize transform clean and purify all the information move the data from origin to destination in real time and have the necessary processing power to control coordinate and manage the Simulation Network as if the entire telecommunication network was a single Network Platform Equipment being capable of handling millions of fixed wireless and IP telephony subscribers. The Simulation Network requires at least one client and one server nodes for each switch and consists of at least one tier of switches having one or more switches.

Lower Tier Partial Leg A and partial Leg B node use Artificial Intelligence Business rules to fill the missing gaps of information.

Lower Tier Parser is responsible for converting all of the INBOUND messages of the environment into a lingua franca and the OUTBOUND messages to the appropriate NPE packet protocol.

Lower Tier Storager is designed to load balance and to distribute tasks so that the nodes can scan for new activities and upon detecting new messages execute predefined task. E.g. JAM messages instantiate a new record and SSN which the assigned Call Owner must create.

Lower Tier Summit Grid Node is responsible for all of the activities of the lower tier switch. This node can match merge as its parent middleware tier switch when creating regional calls once it has determined its own Leg A or its equivalent since subscribers might reside outside of the network s environment.

Lower Tier Partial Summit Grid Node is responsible for correlating Partial Vector Legs B T data of a call so that the Summit Grid Node of the partial Leg A can match merge the different Partial Vector CDR into a single billing entity.

Lower Tier Independent Networks Fixed Layer Nodes Wireless Layer Nodes IP telephony Layer Nodes mimic monitor replicate and simulate the activities of the messages of their corresponding networks and convert the raw and redundant data into normalized and primed data so that other grid and cluster nodes can use them.

The main problem with telephony is that 98 of the calls use more than 1 NPE to create a single version of the truth billing entity and to further exacerbate the situation as Wireless becomes the dominant player of the globe with respect to telecommunications up to 50 of the calls will become Hybrid and 5 complex.

Thus an improvement with regards to the existing patents was required and the lower tier switch that behaves as a macro switch that assimilates all of the Fixed IP Telephony and Wireless messages within a geographical location.

Each Fixed network Central Office Switch wireless network XO IP Telephony Intelligent Component and CPE is simulated and the location of the end user is triangulated to a specific location based on organizational Business Rules.

Parser Nodes Interfaces with the Environment And is responsible for interfacing with the environment and converting all of the information into a lingua franca and assigning it to the correct directory and the appropriate forward and rearward chained updates to the system the assignment of unique ID and the different distinct call elements Legs A B T X Y W and Call Owner.

Storager Functions Nodes Update and Load Balance Data And is responsible for Deleting Inserting Load Balancing Replicating and Updating Data that is pertinent to the system. And has the information of each circuit and subscriber belonging to the system and have special scripts to follow the organization Business Rules to determine the acceptable location of each circuit of the call.

Partial A function Node Determines Leg A And is responsible for determining that the call originates Leg A resides within the local domain of the lower tier switch then gathers all of the information to creates a bitmap packets so that the each HQ can match merge Partial Vector CDR information.

Partial B function Node Determines Leg B And is responsible for determining that the call destination Leg B resides within the local domain of the lower tier switch then gathers all of the information to creates a bitmap packets so that the each HQ can match merge Partial Vector CDR information.

Summit Grid Node Controls the Cluster of Computer Grid The Summit Grid Node for each HQ integrates the flow of information of the Fixed IP Telephony and Wireless nodes so they can work together using lateral and vertical synergy to logically find the missing gaps of information by using organizational Business Rules.

Middleware Tier Switch may act as it Parent when it knows that an entire call is within the domain of a single network and the ownership of the call resides within its organization. This upgrade was created to eliminate the unnecessary flow of data upwards towards the summit tiers that saturate the system.

Middleware Tier Partial B Handles Hybrid Complex Calls permits the HQ summit node to handle the Leg B side of a Hybrid or Complex Call. Using business rules determines if the Leg B side vector trajectory is within the geospatial area of coverage of its organization so it can match merge the Vector CDR since it possesses all of the Partial Vector components.

Lower Tier the Workhorse the lower tier switch is a subdivision of the computer network system and its workhorse. E.g. X Commerce and U Commerce are commercial examples of the three tier Supercomputer architecture.

Matching 2 Independent Calls with Partial Differential Equation the use of Partial Differential Equations permits the system to handle 2 independent calls eliminating the unnecessary flow of data upwards towards the summit tiers that tend to saturate the system. Once the geospatial data is normalized and plotted the summit tier uses routing algorithms to fill the missing gaps of information to match merge the Vector CDR without placing any burden to the summit tiers.

The Parser converts messages into a lingua franca standard and updates 3party inventory means. The Storager distributes tasks to a plurality of Intelligent Components the latest conditions of the environment and priorities to satisfy quotes and orders with the lowest cost and time delays to the end user. The for Suppliers for Wholesalers and Retailers consists of a plurality of HQ1 HQ0 nodes that manage and control the 3party inventory means of suppliers and their organizations. and have the geographic subset i j and are linked to a common denominator UCommerce Warehouse H3 HQ2 that serves as Leg B final destination when merchandise is shipped from originating 3parties.

The system creates a Vectors CDR that has a complete quote or order that is part of more complex data structures such as a macro order. The Lower Tier is a subset i j subordinate of a Middleware Tier set i that controls a continental region which in turn belongs to the superset U . The partial differential equation permits the match merge of a plurality of quotes and orders into complex structures and also permits that each end user request be unique. Once the geospatial data is normalized the system can use available Inventory to find the optimal price.

The system integrates an x or Retailers y or Suppliers and z or Wholesalers and then optimizes its inventory means into dx dy and dz respectively that are available to a UCommerce warehouse. The messages from these 3party inventory means are integrated and standardized as Vectors CDR that possess Leg A origin Leg T U Tandem destination and Leg B final destination points for the world wide delivery of merchandise. Using business rules the system can purchase one item for one end user or in mass for a plurality of customers.

The Parser converts the messages into a lingua franca standard and updating the 3party inventory means.

The partial differential equation permits the match merge of a plurality of quotes and orders into complex structures and permits each end user request be unique. Upon the geospatial data is normalized the system can use available Inventory to find the optimal price.

Each of the subordinate also possesses Partial A Partial B Parser and Storager that manage and control regions that match merge regional scope transactions or the portion of the transaction under their command.

a Search the best price based on local scope sector i j k 0 1 for South Florida i j k 1 2 for North Florida and i j k 1 3 for Georgia . Then determine overall best price in this case i j k 0 1 located in South Florida.

b Compare the available inventory levels of each retailer. Three retailers have available inventory with optimal prices available for the geographical area.

d Compares the best retailer price against the UCommerce warehouse prices using X FOB and Y CDIF calculation to find the optimal route to send to the end user the purchase order with the best price shortest delay and reliable shipping means.

Billing Engine stores the Summary Reports Data Structures Collectively the Billing Engine via the Storager function of each Tier stores the Information in summary reports data structures so that the system has at its disposal the inventory of each 3party from point A to point B as optimal based on a quantity and shipping method selected by the customer. E.g. when an end user requests a quote the system checks for each local regional continental and Internet scope retailer wholesaler and supplier inventory distribution means for the best case scenario that satisfies the consumer.

Vector CDR with Associated Cost and Delays Once the best case scenario is identified the system creates a Vector CDR with Legs A B U T with the associated cost and delays.

Collectively the Billing Engine via the Storager function of each Tier haw specialized search engine clusters the summary report data structures so that the system has at its disposal a minor image of the content of the Internet. In this case when the end user requests an Internet browser search the system checks based on priority of each keyword contained in its request for the best case scenario that satisfies the consumer. Note prior art uses the divide and conquer filtering with regular expressions to help quantify and qualify the best case scenario whereas XCommerce utilizes summary reports from its managerial relationship indices that are derived from higher quality levels of Informational Pyramid Structures.

Once the best case scenario is identified the system creates a list of discrete amount of responses from the highest to the lowest that are displayed in the end user s browser.

UCommerce Lower Tier Transforms the Environment On the right hand side consists of the new transformation of the UCommerce technology in which all of the retailers wholesalers and suppliers belong to a TWS and all of the Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers are working in unison as part of a cluster. The HQ3 controls the entire geographical area that possesses a plurality of subordinates Lower Tiers to controlling SE NW and DF subdivisions of Mexico. Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers are arranged as groups of elements working together and continuously interacting to find the best price for the end user.

UCommerce Middleware Tier Transforms the Environment On the right hand side consists of the new transformation of the UCommerce technology in which all of the retailers wholesalers and suppliers belong to a Lower Tier or TWS and all of the Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers are working in unison as part of a cluster. The summit SIS controls the entire geographical area that possesses a plurality of subordinates SIS and TWS to controlling all of the regions of North America. In this case the figure only shows the Mexico distribution since USA East USA West and Canada would not fit in the diagram. For simplicity let s consider them cloned like with a single HQ4 that possesses HQ3 organizations consisting of HQ2 to HQ0 clusters. Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers are arranged as groups of elements working together and continuously interacting to derive the best price.

Intelligent Components through means of their Intelligent Data Warehouses that are part of an XLDB are responsible for normalizing the information and making it readily available to the end user.

UCommerce Summit Tier Transforms the Environment In this case B consists of the new transformation of the UCommerce technology in which all of the suppliers wholesalers and suppliers belong to a Lower Tier and each Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers work in unison as part of a cluster. The summit MPS controls the entire geographical area that possesses a plurality of subordinates MPS that possess a plurality of SIS organizations that have a plurality of TWS organizations controlling all of the regions of the World.

Each Tier organization creates their own Summary Report that competes each time and an end user makes a quote for goods and services. And for each item requested by the end user identifies the best price to the Leg B destination. UCommerce warehouse and upon receiving notification of a purchase match merges each item into a single quote.

Web Browser Regular Expression Response A Is the most satisfying responses derived from a search engine to a web browser regular expression. The cluster of 64 nodes is ideally a lower tier configuration and manage 2 30 web or 1 billion pages each middleware tier manages x 20 lower tiers and the x2 summit tiers manages x2 middleware tiers so that the environment is overlapped four times.

Final Destination UCommerce Warehouse 5 match merges partial orders into a final and complete order and then sends them through the transportation channels to the final destination.

Plurality of Orders are matched merged into a Macro Order 6 Shows how from a plurality of Retailers Suppliers and Wholesalers merchandise is sent to an UCommerce warehouse and the system links common denominator containers into a plurality of Macro X FOB. For example 5 containers full of merchandise from the same originating warehouse leave via UPS the same day and with the same transportation means to the same destination UCommerce warehouse the system will consider them as a large container or macro order.

UCommerce 2010 UCommerce purchases the merchandise directly and owns it until delivery unless the end user purchases Inventory In hand merchandise via GOLD LABEL. Otherwise the system will purchase in bulk quantities at the lowest prices and lowest transportation cost to replenish its warehouse based of forecasted demands so that it can minimize the forecast demand of its customers.

At the same time the MPS has an interface to a 2 browser engines cluster or 3party Supercomputer 8 8 that analyzes the content of the 3 environment or the Internet and has the capacity of retrieving the most valuable responses for each KEYWORD regular expression request made by an end user. In other words the MPS interacts with a search engine supercomputer to create single or groups of KEYWORDS Environmental Bitmaps or Summary Reports data structures which are the basis for developing the higher structures. In this case the HQ0 to HQ2 are responsible for not just simulating and mimicking the Network Platform Equipment or Browser Engine individual nodes of the environment but for communicating and working together with them. The supplier system in order to work in real time must first create the environmental bitmaps and the higher structure Environmental Bitmaps process that can take one or two months at which point both technologies are integrated and synchronized as is hereinafter referred as XCommerce.

XCommerce 2010 Join Block Wall and Ceiling are a collection of language specific keywords that filter and validate the content of the web page.

XCommerce 2010 The lower tier analyzes a request in the millions middleware tiers in the thousands and the summit tier in the hundreds using vector math to find the optimize size sample. Each web site is given a quality value from 1 to 10 and weight value of pages that belongs to the optimal size sample from 1 for a quality of 2 or 32 for a quality of 32. Using summary reports statistics data the system knows without searching the exact quality that will yield the twice the optimal size sample thus redundancy and irrelevant calculations.

 Not included in the FIG. E.g. the end user further narrows the search by using the KEYWORDS USA FLORIDA AVENTURA RESTAURANTS ARGENTINIAN creating X Y and Z results that range between 50 and 100 replies that are the basis for Complex Pyramid Structures. Prior art uses Caesar s Divide and Conquer strategies whereas XCommerce uses Summary Report Data Structures or Environmental Bitmaps based on weight values algorithms.

XCommerce 2010 each tier stores information based on quality levels to quickly reach the optimal size sample absent of calculation. 1 XCommerce uses the English language filter of Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling collection to validate each web page. 2 Assigns a vector value to each web page by matching each KEYWORDS or KEYWORDS GROUP or KEYWORDS COMBINATIONS to determine the best results for a given request.

XCommerce 2010 each lower tier is a Browser Engine Supercomputers 8 8 that manages the content of 1 billion web pages

XCommerce 2010 the lower tier maintains Simple Pyramids the middleware tiers Hybrid Pyramids and the summit tiers Complex Pyramids.

XCommerce 2010 The Simulation Network assigns the optimal lower tier that has a Simple Pyramid with 1 000 000 000 web pages the KEYWORD KEYWORDS GROUPS or KEYWORDS COMBINATIONS requested by the end user. The system uses the W RANK value of each web page that is the adjusted value of a web page based on the known quality of their parent site to create the optimal sized sample of 1 000 000 web pages.

XCommerce 2010 The Simulation Network assigns the optimal middleware tier that has a Hybrid Pyramid with 1 000 000 web pages that owns the KEYWORD KEYWORDS GROUPS or KEYWORDS COMBINATIONS requested by the end user. The system uses the W RANK value of each web page that is the adjusted value of a web page based on the known quality of their parent site to create the optimal sized sample of 10 000 web pages.

XCommerce 2010 The Simulation Network assigns the optimal summit tier that has a Complex Pyramid with 10 000 web pages the KEYWORD KEYWORDS GROUPS or KEYWORDS COMBINATIONS requested by the end user. And uses the W RANK value of each web page and uses the quality of the parent site to further adjust and create optimal sized sample of 10 web pages.

XCommerce 2010 Simple Hybrid and Complex Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling collections are the filtering mechanism used to make the request have a predefined magnitude by using vector math and optimally shrink the environment.

Match Merge and correlating a plurality of subordinate blocks A C The system identifies the raw magnitude of the KEYWORD and maps the content of the Simple and Hybrid Pyramid Structure as the foundation of the Summit Tier of the higher Information Entropy object match merges plurality of building blocks Wall Objects with 50 to 100 cells derived from its subordinate Lower and Middleware Tiers with the TOP 1 and TOP 10 most satisfying responses to the end user. The quality of the HTML content and links to other places is measured.

Simulation Network is a parallel clustered multi tiered Supercomputer consists of a plurality of nodes. Each node is programmed with Artificial Intelligence commercially known as Intelligent Components or IC to perform processing power predefined and ad hoc tasks based that must be logistical rationalized based on the requirements derived from the environment.

Simulation Network Superset U has 3 Tiers The computer network system is also known as the Superset U . The cluster is divided into three geospatial tiers a Global b Regional and c local possessing specialized Data Mitigation Network Trending Provisioning Data Mart and Business Intelligence functionality relying on a sharable Extreme Large Data Base XLDB tier. Each of the nodes or IC is assigned a geospatial area of coverage range from 0 small geographical areas to 7 the world a managerial hierarchy system denoted as HQ. Each Intelligent Component possesses the following characteristics and functions 

Intelligent Component works independently from each other All of the Intelligent Components work collectively and independently from each other and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing evaluating gathering and processing information from the environment in real time or from the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic piece of information that triggers new and updates pending activities or tasks. The cluster of computers must be subdivided into a superset set subset geospatial tiers 

Summit Tier has Global Geospatial Scope coordinates the Data Mart cluster used for Business Intelligence and Invoicing that works with UCommerce Software via the Internet that allows users to have access to their business and personal information in real time. The system analyzes each UCommerce Software interaction to better understand what the client values in order to keep the subscriber satisfied. The summit node of the cluster U has control of all of the financial institutions interfaces human resources and Network Platform Equipments of an organization. Consequently each Intelligent Component has the four cluster configurations as follows HQx I K y T where x ranges from 0 local to 7 global geospatial scope I Global Superset J Region Set K Local subset y denotes the element and T XLDB or Data Mart Cluster.

Middleware Tier has Regional Geospatial Scope controls UCommerce warehouses based on continent or continental region.

Lower Tier has Local Geospatial Scope controls a plurality of points of presence that interface with suppliers wholesalers and retailers. These HQ2 to HQ0 collectively constitute the workhorse of the system and control of users requests and replies to the system. These Intelligent Components coordinate and synchronize the entire billing provisioning and TQM functionality requests and replies. They also have the ability to interact with 3parties organizations and supply them with a summary of all of the data they have processed.

Simulation Network Synchronizes All Inventories Virtually simulate 3parties organization functionality by partitioning and decentralizing their global distribution means by assigning them to regional TWS continental SIS or worldwide MPS. Each Intelligent Component and Intelligent Data Warehouse must only synchronize the latest inventory once every predefined cycle and then is programmed to optimize and maximize its organizational management logistics. The nodes of the system will interact directly with the provisioning and physical or queued inventory of each member of a 3party distribution means.

Summary Reports of the Environment Permit Synergy each node can request to members of the same cluster any excess buffer resources to complete a task. Each parent tier cluster can coordinate the resources their subordinates to complete a task. Sibling tier cluster can synergistically collaborate to process tasks.

Intelligent Components Remove Chaos and Anarchy the supplier system interacts with the environment and gathers distills analyzes standardizes and convert the raw information into primed data which in turn is organized and transformed so that Information Entropy is achieved and thus chaos and anarchy or Spaghetti Phenomena is eliminated.

UCommerce uses Lingua Franca Primed Messages Collectively Intelligent Components work together to parallel and simulate an existing organization that possesses an UCommerce supplier system. And each message has a single version of the truth vector trajectory that assigns a discrete amount of Intelligent Components so they can communicate amongst themselves or members of the organization and the Internet clients. Based on the vector trajectory each message has an owner and the path so Intelligent Components can communicate amongst themselves via forward and rearward chaining. The software sends the parameters to a single or plurality of clusters so they can optimally analyze assign calculate distribute prioritize and weight the rate of messages and timing limitations for the next queue of incoming messages based on the conditions of the environment and historical trends.

Intelligent Component are independent working entity or an element of a given superset set or subset grouping with the following characteristics 

Remove Redundancy from the Environment gather and distill raw data to remove redundancy geospatially distribute activities and correlate and update information and then valorize the resources and capacities of the network by using synergy to avoid not taxing the capacity of the network in real time.

Analyze the Conditions of the Environment manage and organize the flow of information within their organization from predefined point A to point B routes to avoid clogs and saturation maximize throughput and assign and prioritize cluster nodes via synergy that have substantial buffer resources since unused resources are considered waste which is the independent variable that is directly related in creating the Spaghetti Phenomena . And immediately create plot and update purchase orders as soon as new messages from the environment are processed.

Remove Complexity to Reach Information Entropy based on the known latest working conditions of each Intelligent Component network routing traffic patterns and throughput limitation of each given domain. The Simulation Network performs the non obvious task of removing complexity in order to be a real time system by eliminating data redundancy filtering quantifying qualifying data as good or garbage and minimizing waste before beginning to transmit the data through the managerial hierarchy system. And thus eliminate the Spaghetti Phenomena at its incipiency to reach Information Entropy.

Autonomous and work together as a Single Unit Each Intelligent Component is programmed to be autonomous and through means of the managerial hierarchy and synergy can work in parallel with others to function as a single unit.

UCommerce makes all Purchase Orders in Parallel Every single activity and purchase order is made in parallel starting from the point of origin and ending at the point of destination and by rearward chaining of routing vector information through the simulation network to the point of origin. The computer network system which plots a purchase order providing the lowest prices and the best terms and conditions available for that transaction at that moment and a request is initiated and continues in real time as the activity progresses.

Simulation Network Managerial Hierarchy the Simulation Network analyzes and evaluate the best usage network resources as follows 

An Intelligent Component is a node that belongs to the Simulation Network and is programmed using artificial intelligence to perform a particular task depending on the tier it belongs there are three tiers lower tier middleware tier and the summit tier.

All the components work collectively and independently from each other and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing evaluating gathering and processed information from the environment in real time or from the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic piece of information that triggers new and updates pending activities or tasks. An Intelligent component can programmed to belong any of the following three tiers 

The lower tiers analyze update monitor control validate verify and administer information independently. This alone eliminates the need for a central mainframe and also reduces the raw workload in an unobvious manner. The method of the invention removes redundant data at incipiency enabling the system to function in real time which is a significant aspect of the present invention

Depending on the size of the network the architecture defining the way the computers are linked together may comprise varying types and degrees of scope such as for example retailer wholesaler and supplier organizations each with its own parent and subordinates. For the purposes of this invention retailer wholesaler and supplier define available scopes that best reflect supply side organizations and their resources.

a Process Messages and Transactions Receives and sends messages and transactions for all of the activities performed by the end users that interface with the system .

Update Available Inventories continuously update the latest shipping cost formulas geographical location of retailers suppliers system warehouses wholesalers and their available inventories.

Match Merge Multiple Activities from multiple end users with regards to the same supplier to afford the best competitive rate via economy of scale discounts where applicable.

UCommerce Managerial Hierarchy Distribution the simulation network has a hierarchical structure that is geospatial in nature where each HQ is assigned a value from 0 local to 7 global denotes its authority position power and responsibility.

Simulation Network Delegation of Command each node by means of lateral synergy where a subordinate creates a virtual instance of its immediate superior and acts and functions in the same manner as its supervisor including the same delegated authority and responsibility within the hierarchy.

Summit Tier the Superset U the summit tier monitors and controls the environment or Internet or Superset U and is responsible for prioritizing the resources of its subordinates. The summit tier performs the following 

Summit Tier Functions i Coordinates the activities of the subscriber software driven requests. ii Analyzes gathers and identifies purchasing patterns of behavior. iii Puts buyers and sellers together. iv Determines customer level of satisfaction. v Communicates with the outside of the environment via the Internet.

Middleware Tier the Sets controls the actual inventory and makes financial decisions using mini cost algorithms. These elements gather information and study patterns of purchasing and production behavior and faults and then make on their own ad hoc optimized logistics reports that are submitted 3parties. This inverted or reverse ad hoc query does not hog the resources of the network since the system builds the report on its own by summarizing the reports of its subordinates and then sending them to the user. Each middleware tier controls a geographical region of the Internet or the set where U I J K . And manages the logistical flow of transportation and queuing of delivery of goods and services from an UCommerce warehouse to the destination. And merges multiple requests as one to have better bargaining power and lower costs to the consumer via economies of scale.

Lower Tier Subsets validates and verifies each end user request and reply and is assigned an ownership of several end users. This tier at incipiency determines the origin tandem and destination of the transaction. By means of the data mining activities of the client software the system updates and keeps the end users profile current. Each lower tier controls a subset of the Internet by modeling a plurality of retailers suppliers and wholesalers organization points of presence and interacts directly with their provisioning systems.

X FOB Method penalizes the FOB price based on the number of days the product is away from the C F port. X FOB stands for delay free FOB price. X FOB is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A to UCommerce warehouse Leg T or Leg U using Ocean Land and Cargo transportation services where delivery is preferred in days.

Y CDIF Method stands for delay free CDIF door to door service. Y CDIF is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A Leg T or Leg U to destination Leg B after paying cargo duties and insurance and using Cargo and Express shipment transportation services where delivery is preferred in hours taking into account cost as constraint. Y CDIF Gold is a rush service when the client requires merchandise ASAP where cost is a secondary constrain and time the primary and immediate service is optimal.

X FOB and Y CDIF Calculations are a way to calculate the quality and versatility of a transport route from Leg A to Leg B Warehouse.

X FOB Routing the supplier system determines the best route for sending merchandise FOB or C F. The supplier also assigns the best FOB P U by using via X FOB method and then determines the best C F UCommerce Warehouse by default. Alternatively the end user can select a different path from the critical path and the system will warn any time delays and cost differences.

Y CDIF Routing The supplier system determines the best path to send CDF merchandise via Y CDIF method and the end user only has to specify where they want the goods and services delivered. Every time the system detects a significant change in inventory for a given product the system will update all of the clients of the newly derived critical paths for delivering good and services.

X FOB and Y CDIF Restocking After each purchase each tier determines how to replenish Inventory In Hand levels and purchase optimal levels of merchandise to maintain the minimum amount of inventory in stock at the lowest cost. X FOB restocks in ocean land or cargo transportation methods whereas Y CDIF uses green blue or red labels. Y CDIF Gold uses red or black labels.

UCommerce Searches The client software must require from the end user a supplier before making a search. Once the end user selects the valid supplier for a given product the system can start the partial search commands that are sent to each TWS SIS and MPS that using X FOB and Y CDIF methods create optimal transportation cost from Leg X to Leg Y. When the supplier system responds from the active memory information of each Intelligent Component the client merges all of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. Each node does not make a SQL command request instead has control of the inventory and is responsible for coordinating the flow of information sent to it to be processed by the different clients. Once the information is made to the node it will match merge optimal routes in its entirety or partially until the best satisfying means of delivery are obtained.

UCommerce Pickups the end user delivers at the nearest authorized agents the goods with the original cost so that the system can generate the quote for the duties and expenses at the final destination. Each order confirmation uses an authorized agent that accepts the goods to be shipped in behalf of the client and then sends them to the final destination via C F CDF or CDIF as the client selected.

UCommerce Restocking When making a search for C F CIF CDF and CDIF the system calculates X FOB and Y CDIF until the warehouse has enough Inventory In Hand to satisfy the order. Thus if an end user requested quote demands for a quantity of items that exceeds available Inventory In Hand the system will do the following 1 Requests the missing Inventory via X FOB and Y CDIF restocking means. 2 Then merchandise will receive the appropriate time delay for availability in the system. 3 Ideally the system will request all of the missing merchandise from the manufacturer as one consolidated order since the merchandise will not leave until all of the units are available. 4 All of the FOB quotes from UCommerce Warehouse offer X FOB Inventory In Hand with the corresponding restocking delay. 5 All of the C F CDF and CDIF quotes will offer both X FOB and Y CDIF to the final destination port with the corresponding restocking delay whereas Y CDIF Gold makes available the actual Inventory In Hand with no delay.

X FOB Inventory Control Bitmaps Each tier TWS SIS and MPS creates a X FOB real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate Intelligent Components to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information such as 1 Availability 2 Quantity In Hand 3 Highest Quantity 4 Best Price 5 Most Reliable route and 6 transportation means.

Y CDIF Inventory Control Bitmaps Each tier creates an Y CDIF real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate nodes to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information. The bitmaps consist of 0 and 1 to notify which supplier carries a specific product in the Available field. The In Hand consists of a number of 2 to the n 1 power in hexadecimal form 0 to 32758 products in hand. The highest bitmap is a hexadecimal value that calculates how much inventory a specific supplier has where F means unlimited. The best Price and Most Reliable bitmaps sort with ranking which supplier offers the best service to the end user. These numbers are updated after each change in inventory to reflect the latest optimal prices and paths. These bitmaps have preprocessed all of the calculations with the best case inventory and logistical flow for a given item using X FOB and Y CDIF guidelines eliminating the need for end users software components to have to do the calculations or bog down the system with unnecessary queries.

UCommerce 2010 The X FOB and Y CDIF Inventory Control Bitmaps are commonly known and referred as managerial relationship indices summary results that have pre calculated look up information to eliminate the need of redundant and resource intensive calculations.

The system when calculating X FOB and Y CDIF calculates the U Commerce value that ranges from best to worst which is used to modify the expected time delays when shipping goods from origin to destination.

Rule 1 U Commerce warehouses in strategic locations worldwide that have Inventory Hand have a plus 2 UC Value. Otherwise the warehouse will offer merchandise from the same country shipping via ground or express mail.

Rule 2 define Service Economies which include US Japan Germany Spain Italy Japan France and United Kingdom and have an Industrial Basis of 2.

Rule 3 define Industrial Market Economies which include Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Chile China Denmark Egypt Greece Hong Kong Ireland Israel Mexico Morocco Netherlands Nigeria Norway Poland Portugal Russia Singapore South Korea Switzerland Taiwan Turkey and Ukraine and have an Industrial Basis of 1.

Rule 4 define Third World Economies consisting of the remainder of the countries in the World and have an Industrial Basis of 0.

Rule 5 If Leg A and Leg B belong to the same country then add a 2 for domestic modifier. International shipments have a 0 modifier. The system can calculate FOB C F or CDF prices. The system will only calculate FOB and C F when Leg A and Leg B reside in the same country.

Rule 7 Service and Industrial Market Economies can enhance trade using comparative advantage philosophy of trade. To reflect this protrade variable to the U Commerce system the following assumption SE Service Economies and IE Industrial Market Economies located in America Asia and Europe with region being are considered to be part of the Supra Continent and receive no adverse intercontinental modifier. Commerce between the United States of America and another country receives a plus 1 pro trade modifier.

Rule 8 Countries of the former Soviet Union where Continent is Asia or Europe and with region receive a 1 regional modifier and no adverse intercontinental modifier.

Rule 9 Countries that belong to the Middle East where Continent is Asia or Europe and with Region receive a 1 regional modifier and no adverse intercontinental modifier.

Rule 10 Industrial Market Economies IE countries in Asia get a regional modifier of 1 when exporting to other industrial economies in America or Europe with Region . Asian Industrial Market Economies in region 1 get a 1 adverse intercontinental modifier when importing goods and services from any region Europe or America. This is to further adjust the asymmetrical trade between continents. Japan receives the export 1 regional modifier to other Industrial Market Economies IE but doesn t suffer an adverse intercontinental modifier.

Rule 11 Industrial Market Economies IE countries in Europe with Region Central or Balkans get a regional modifier of 1 when exporting to Europe Region European Common Market . These countries get a 1 adverse regional modifier when importing goods and services from Europe Region . Note countries that become expanded members of the European Common Market will become Region .

Rule 12 Industrial Market Economies IE countries in South America get a regional modifier of 1 when importing from America Region . These countries get a 1 adverse regional modifier when exporting goods and services from America Region . This is to further adjust the asymmetrical trade between regions due to the NAFTA. Note countries that become part of the expanded North America Free Trade Agreement will become Region .

Rule 14 IE Industrial Market Economies using Continental Barriers for 3E world countries or vice versa when shipping 

Rule 15 Intercontinental trade between two industrial market economies or service economies has no adverse modifiers.

Rule 16a To calculate the U Commerce Value the system must determine the value of six variables and then add them together to find the final value.

Rule 16b U Commerce will offer services based on the final system value defined by using the following formula based on the U Commerce Value UCV services can be determined.

Rule 17 to determine C F U Commerce uses the Maxi Cost method to derive prices. The system calculates the lowest price to deliver the goods to a specific port. C F also includes Ocean and Air line Cargo that calculated by pound or kilogram shipments.

Rule 18 To determine CDF U Commerce uses the Maxi Cost method to derive the cost. Use C F cost plus duties. U Commerce allows the end user to make the tariff 0 where applicable or user defined based on the actual circumstances. The system assigns the Mini Duties Cost to be 50 the actual duties rate this is done reflect the Far East Asia low costs for durable goods.

Rule 19 Depending on the origin and destination countries and the U Commerce value the system offers the following air shipment methods 

These services can be added to the FOB cost since the U Commerce supplier system has multiple warehouses in strategic locations worldwide.

Rule 21 End user client software protocols to improve throughput and to eliminate unnecessary requests that burden a supplier system database.

Rule 22 X FOB calculations the software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structure with critical data that allows the client to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of look up tables stored in memory or open file with a product list to determine what product are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files all the static data that is displayed in the graphical user interface GUI . The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible to merge and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. The system will prioritize each available product based on U Commerce shipment value and overall net price. Once the client gets the updated price it adds the domestic shipment when Inventory is not available. X FOB penalizes the FOB price based on the number of days the product is away from the C F port. X FOB stands for delay free FOB price.

Rule 23 Y CDIF calculations the software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structure with critical data that allows the client to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of look up tables stored in memory or open file with a product list to determine what product are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files all the static data that is displayed in the graphical user interface GUI . The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible to merge and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. Once the system has assigned a X FOB price for a given product. The end user s selects a C F international shipping method via Air White Green Blue Red and or Black Label express mail services. The International shipment charge if any are added to the FOB price per unit. The system then calculates the Air shipment method expressed in hours to further adjust the FOB price International Shipment Value Added Duties. In other words the system will penalize or make more expensive the Y CDIF price of a product the more time it requires to reach the front door of the customer. Y CDIF stands for delay free CDIF door to door service.

UCommerce 2010 Single version of the truth is a management information system common terms that is used in billing. And involves the gathering all the related information related to a particular transaction. And then requires the steps of data mediation to convert and prime the information into a common data structure. And then sends the primed information to a centralized mainframe or billing component that match merges all the transactional pieces of information and then associates by transaction. And finally correlates all the transactional pieces into a final billing entity with all the dynamic and static costs.

Rule 24 Each Intelligent component determines for each supplier and wholesaler the best continental regional warehouse for sending merchandise FOB or C F. The supplier also assigns the best FOB price via X FOB rule 22 and then determines the C F destination ports to sends goods and services. When making calculation the client uses the geographical U Commerce Warehouse by default. Alternatively the end user can different path from the critical path and the system will make the appropriate calculation. The client software will immediately monitor and track the critical path and end user defined path and warn any time delays and cost differences.

Rule 25 The supplier system determines the best path to send CDF merchandise via Y CDIF rule 23 and the end user only has to specify where they want the goods and services delivered. Every time the system detects a significant change in inventory for a given product it will update all of the clients of the newly derived critical paths for delivering good and services.

Rule 26 The client software must require from the end user a supplier before making a search. Once the end user selects the valid supplier for a given product the system can start the partial search commands that are sent to the Genesis Engine architecture. When the supplier system responds from the active memory information of each intelligent component the client merges all of the partial command to a single version of the truth. The Intelligent component do not make a SQL command requests instead the Intelligent Component has control of the inventory and is responsible managing and coordinating the flow of information send to them to be processed by the different clients.

Rule 27 The end user can also request the shipping only through the U Commerce method supplier system. The end user delivers at the nearest authorized agents the goods with the original cost so that the system can generate the quote for the duties and expenses at the final destination. Each order confirmation uses an authorized agent that accepts the goods to be ship in behalf of the client and then sends them to the final destination via C F CDF or CDIF as the client selected.

Rule 28 When making a search for C F CIF CDF and CDIF the system calculates X FOB and Y CDIF until the warehouse has enough Inventory In Hand to satisfy the order. Thus if an end users requested quote demands for a quantity of items that exceeds available Inventory In Hand the system will do the following 

Request the missing Inventory via Ground for X FOB and Air for Y CDIF. All of the units will receive the added delay.

Ideally the system will request all the missing merchandise from the manufacturer as one consolidated order since the merchandise will not leave until all the units are available. Unless the customer accepts partial shipments to satisfy a large order that uses several suppliers.

All FOB quotes from U Commerce Warehouse offer X FOB Inventory In Hand with the corresponding delay All C F quotes CDF and CDIF quotes will offer both X FOB and Y CDIF to the final destination port with the corresponding delay.

Rule 29 X FOB real time Inventory control allows Intelligent Component monitoring a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information such as available In Hand Highest Quantity Best Price and Most Reliable

Rule 30 works the same as Rule 29 except it is for Y CDIF. The bitmaps consist of 0 and 1 to notify which supplier carries a specific product in the Available field. The In Hand consist to a number of 2 to the n 1 power in hexadecimal form 0 to 32758 products in hand. Highest bitmap is a hexadecimal value that calculates how much inventory a specific supplier has where F means unlimited. Best Price and Most Reliable bitmaps sort with ranking which supplier offers the best service to the end user. These numbers are update after each change in inventory to reflect the latest optimal prices and paths. These bitmaps or summary report database structures have all the preprocessed math done with best case inventory and logistical flow for a given item using X FOB and Y CDIF guidelines eliminating the need for clients components to have to do the calculations or bog down the system with unnecessary queries.

Rule 31 The system also offers CSF method which is identical to CDF with the only exception is that it use sub rates normally 50 below regular duties. Optionally the end user can select CWF that is identical to CDF with the only exception that duties are calculated based weight only. CSF and CWF with insurance become CSIF and CWIF respectively.

Rule 32 X FOB and Y CDIF end user adjustments. X FOB usually made to offset the cost associated with Ocean Cargo delays from origin to destination. In some instances the end user will be able to prioritize the X FOB to be measured in days and not in weeks by allowing the system to calculate X FOB with Air Cargo. Y CDIF usually made to offset cost related with Air Cargo delays from origin to destination. In some instances the end user will be able to prioritize the Y CDIF to be measured in hours and not in days by allowing the system to calculate Y CDIF with Gold Label.

Rule 33 Makes a shipment between U Commerce warehouses with a time delay for execution. The system will consolidate multiple orders of several customers to lower the cost. The system will reflect the shipping cost at the quote module level anticipating minimal shipping cost taking into account the critical shipment weight to derived substantial discount is reached. Once a consolidated order is sent from Warehouse A to Warehouse B the order is broken down piece meal distributed and then delivered to the final destination to each individual customer.

User wants to purchase industrial spare parts from available U Commerce warehouses using X FOB rules to determine the best real cost.

Referring to an end user requires an industrial part FOB for maintenance of existing machinery. To perform said task using the supplier system the end user first has the following 

1 Select the category of products 2 Select the U Commerce Warehouse. For simplicity the end user select WORLD. Once a valid spare part is place in the input field the local UCommerce software verify that the product is valid and is available. Furthermore interchange spare parts that have the same characteristics will be made.

Warehouses that have Inventory In Hand or via Domestic Rush FOB availability participating. When the end user selects Domestic Rush FOB a shipping method must be selected. The cost of shipment and the delay time required to send the merchandise from the supplier outlet to the U Commerce is added to any calculation.

E.g. The end user selects an Industrial Ball Bearing product XYZ. The end user wants to know all available Inventory In Hand available or any valid merchandise that matches the product interchange table. UCommerce validates that the product exist and also identifies all of the interchange table equivalents. UCommerce software identifies within the U Commerce Supercomputer hierarchy which warehouses carryout the spare part or equivalents.

UCommerce software reads the compressed file structure with critical data that allows for optimized searches. UCommerce software breaks the file structure and the field of Inventory In Hand. The system reads 0 or 1 as part of string where each string element corresponds to physical warehouses. After scanning the field it determines three ones that correspond to three U Commerce warehouses located at New Delhi India Nairobi Kenya and Miami Fla. USA. The system identifies the location of the end user which is Sao Paolo Brazil and will be used from X FOB calculations. X FOB will adjust raw prices with time delays and U Commerce Values using Ground or Ocean Express.

Using Rules 1 22 the supplier system makes the sub queries request and calculates the real cost and X FOB delays and adjustments using Ocean and Ground shipping constraints to make calculations absolute in terms of the clients perspective that would ultimately require the merchandise to be delivered in Sao Paolo Brazil. Then UCommerce software match and merge the results of each sub query as a single version of the truth and highlight to the end users the most satisfying alternative via New Delhi India route since it is the most cost efficient in absolute terms.

Once the client gets the updated price it adds the Domestic Rush FOB when Inventory In Hand is not available. X FOB penalizes the FOB price based on the number of days the product is away from the C F port. X FOB stands for delay free FOB price.

User wants the best door to door CDIF service to purchase an industrial spare part from available U Commerce using X FOB and Y CDIF rule to determine the fastest route and best cost.

Referring to an end user requires an industrial part CDIF for maintenance of existing machinery. To perform said task using the supplier system the end user first has the following 

1 Select the category of products 2 Select the U Commerce Warehouse. For simplicity the end user select WORLD 3 Once a valid spare part is place in the input field the local UCommerce software verify that the product is valid and is available. Furthermore interchange spare parts that have the same characteristics will be made 4 Select the destination port 5 Select the shipping method

Warehouses that have Inventory In Hand or that are available via Domestic Rush FOB. When the end user selects Domestic Rush FOB a shipping method must be selected. The cost of shipment and the delay time required to send the merchandise from the supplier outlet to the U Commerce is added to any calculation. The system also calculates the appropriate duties fees and insurance for the transaction. The end user must select a shipping method from FOB origin warehouse to destination. In this case the end user is willing to pay for Black Label or Next Flight service door to door to Sao Paolo Brazil.

In this example the end user selects an aircraft spare part product ABC. The end user wants to know all available Inventory In Hand available or any valid merchandise that matches the product interchange table. UCommerce software validates that the product exist and also identifies all of the interchange table equivalents. UCommerce software identifies within the U Commerce Supercomputer hierarchy which warehouses carryout the spare part or equivalents.

For the purposes of this example UCommerce software reads the compressed file structure with critical data that allows for optimized searches. UCommerce software breaks the file structure and the field of U Commerce with Inventory In Hand. The system reads 0 or 1 as part of string where each string element corresponds to physical warehouses. After scanning the field it determines three ones that correspond to three U Commerce warehouses located at Seoul Korea London UK and Miami Fla. USA. The system identifies the location of the end user which is Sao Paolo Brazil and will be used from Y CDIF calculations. Y CDIF will adjust raw prices with time delays and U Commerce Values using Express Ail Mail.

Using Rule 1 28 the supplier system makes the sub queries request and calculates the real cost and X FOB and Y CDIF delays and adjustments using Air Ground and Ocean shipping constraints to make calculations absolute in terms of the clients perspective that would ultimately require the merchandise to be delivered in Sao Paolo Brazil. Then UCommerce software match and merge the results of each sub query as a single version of the truth. The software takes into account shipping and time delays constraints to identify the best absolute price using time customs and duties fees and Air Express Shipping as part of the final cost.

When the supplier system Supercomputer searches for available merchandise within its scope of control it will use the default route unless the end user specifically request to consolidate the shipment at a Tandem port. Rule 24 when the end user requests consolidated shipment the system calculates the best satisfying alternative from Origin to Tandem to Destination ports.

Then UCommerce software match and merge the results of each sub query as a single version of the truth and highlight to the end users the most satisfying alternative via Seoul Korea route since it is the most cost efficient in absolute terms. In this case the fastest method is Miami Sao Paolo with an intrinsic delay of 14 hrs. The system selects to ship the goods and service from Korea since it has the lowest price of 16 783 after paying duties and insurance and a delay of 36 hrs.

User is in a dire emergency requiring an industrial spare part a request Gold Label door to door service to determine the safest and fastest.

Referring to the U Commerce supplier systems determines the best Y CDIF calculation using Gold Label Emergency Spare Part service from Seoul Korea Miami USA and London UK to the destination point of Sao Paolo Brazil within 20 hrs. In this case the fastest method is Miami Sao Paolo with an intrinsic delay of 14 hrs. The system selects to ship the goods and service from Miami Fla. USA since it allows the Emergency Spare Part to be delivered to the end user door to door with the 20 hrs limitation. Shipments from Korea and UK are made non applicable since their delay value exceeds 20 hrs.

An end user requires an industrial part emergency CDIF for maintenance of existing machinery. To perform the task using the supplier system the end user first has the following 

1 Select the category of products 2 End Users selects Gold Label which finds the fastest and safest route only 3 Once a valid spare part is place in the input field the local UCommerce software verify that the product is valid and is available. Furthermore interchange spare parts that have the same characteristics will be made 4 Select the destination port and 5 Time constraint.

The supplier system follows the guidelines of Rule 20. The end user wants the product ASAP or within the same day 0 23 hrs.

Warehouses that have Inventory In Hand or that are available via Domestic Rush FOB. The cost of shipment and the delay time required to send the merchandise from the supplier outlet to the U Commerce is added to any calculation. The system also calculates the appropriate duties fees and insurance for the transaction. The end user must select a shipping method from FOB origin warehouse to destination. In this case the end user is willing to pay for Gold Label or emergency spare part service door to door to Sao Paolo Brazil.

E.g. The end user selects an oil refinery spare part product CRITICAL PART. The end user wants to know the product or equivalent that will meet the emergency. UCommerce software validates that the product exist and also identifies all of the interchange table equivalents. UCommerce software identifies within the U Commerce Supercomputer hierarchy which warehouses carryout the spare part or equivalents.

After scanning for available warehouse that carry product CRITICAL PART it determines three ones that correspond to three U Commerce warehouses located at Seoul Korea London UK and Miami Fla. USA. The system identifies the location of the end user which is Sao Paolo Brazil and will be used from Y CDIF calculations. Y CDIF will adjust raw prices with time delays and U Commerce Values using Express Ail Mail.

Applying Rules 1 28 and Intelligent Inventory Delivery Rules the supplier system makes the sub queries request and calculates the real cost and X FOB and Y CDIF delays and adjustments using Air Ground and Ocean shipping constraints to make calculations absolute in terms of the clients perspective that would ultimately require the merchandise to be delivered in Sao Paolo Brazil. Then UCommerce software matches merges the results of each sub query as a single version of the truth. The software takes into account shipping and time delays constraints to identify the best absolute price using time customs and duties fees and Air Express Shipping as part of the final cost.

When performing calculations the supplier system searches for available merchandise within its scope of control it will use the default route path. An alternate path is used for calculations when the end user specifically requests to consolidate the shipment at a Tandem port. Rule 24 when the end user requests consolidated shipment the system calculates the best satisfying alternative from Origin to Tandem to Destination ports.

UCommerce matches merges the results of each sub query as a single version of the truth and highlight to the end users the most satisfying alternative via Miami Fla. USA route since it is the most cost efficient in absolute terms with 23 hours parameter.

In this case the lowest price is Seoul Korea to Sao Paolo with a cost of 16 783. The system selects to ship the goods and services from the USA since it is the safest route within 14 hrs.

Inventory changes occur as purchases orders sales order and or changes of available inventory. Nodes of the system do not have to perform redundant inquiries with regards of price quantity and availability. The system has three paths form origination to destination 

Via U Commerce the merchandise is shipped from retailer wholesaler or supplier to an U Commerce Leg A. Thus each U Commerce node as inventory changes calculates for the cost of shipping a specific product from origin to Leg A. These values alone are updated to all pertinent subordinate nodes and to any higher hierarchal node. Once the merchandise arrives to the U Commerce warehouse the system adds the average cost time of arrival to its final destination on the shipping label.

Via U Commerce Inbound the merchandise is shipped from retailer wholesaler or supplier to an U Commerce Leg A and then shipped Inbound to Leg T. Thus the system calculates the average cost time of arrival from Leg A to Leg T. Then the system adds the average cost time of arrival to its final destination based on the shipping label.

Direct Shipment the merchandise is shipped directly from Leg A to final destination without intermediary Leg T. Then the system adds the average cost time of arrival to its final destination based on the shipping label.

A shipping by Label from U Commerce to each destination country exist that contains the best worst and average time of delivery cost and end users customer s satisfaction rating. The reason most shipment go to an U Commerce Warehouse is that an order must require a consolidation of multiple purchase orders from different places.

For example U Commerce has 1024 participating retailers. The system would have several string fields of 1024 where is a binary number where 0 is false and 1 is true.

Field 4 Quantity is a number 0 to 9 and a letter A Z 2 to the n 1 power. Where A 10 and Z 35. The system doesn t convert the quantity request in a number for example 1024 2 to 10 power so it would be B. 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 4 4 8 5 16 6 32 7 64 8 128 9 256 A 512 B 1024 C 2048 D 4096 E 8192 F 16384 and Z 343599738368 

Field 6 Price Percentage is an ASCII value from 0 to 250 where each point is integer round up of the actual price retail price. ASCII value 125 is 50 of retail price.

These tables exist for GRAY WHITE GREEN BLUE RED BLACK and GOLD label service while the Intelligent Inventory Delivery algorithm has more pre calculated fields.

UCommerce 2010 UCommerce is the Simulation Network and UCommerce software is the tool used by the end user to buy products. UCommerce purchases the merchandise and moves its inventory through the supply line based on predicted demand to optimally lower P U.

Search Engine Supercomputers Several Search Engines exist in the lucrative market of delivering valorized content via the Internet such as Ask Altavista Google MSN and Yahoo to name a few that are based on large scale Supercomputers of thousands of CPU U that are subdivided into groups sets and clusters subsets of 64 specialized nodes or elements that a lightning speed identifies the best satisfying response for a given parameters of regular expressions. Note clusters of 64 nodes distribution tend to be the most cost efficiency arrangement based on the magnitude of the superset UI . These search engines perform millions of daily searches and lion share of the responses occur in less than 0.1 seconds.

XCommerce Is an Inventory Control system similar to UCommerce where the distribution of goods and services is expanded to include electronic links and their corresponding html content. Since the browser entities are a very lucrative endeavor and enjoy long term stream of revenues due in part to the teachings of mass media Target Advertisement from the Berkeley s University professor Dr. Goldhaber. Note this technology will use Optimal Value Advertisement that takes into account economies of scale limited advertisement budgets and mathematical algorithms to maximize customers satisfaction.

Browsers Gather Information The UI or the Internet Universe Superset contains all of the information that is obtained by web crawlers that are programmed to scan predefined subdivision of the chaos and anarchy environment and in return then as geospatial data with balance harmony and proportion so that a cluster of 64 CPU can divide and conquer its content. Each node has 1 n links or content of the Internet. These nodes parse the information with a plurality of regular expressions designed to identify common denominator patterns of alphanumeric characters that are hereinafter referred as KEYWORDS. Each unique IP Address is considered a link that is comprised by a plurality of HTML web pages with content hereinafter referred as PAGES. The cluster using a dictionary of valid Keywords and databases of LINK values helps populate the multi independent variables associated with solving the Eigenvector most satisfying solution based on the known content UI .

Browsers Standardize Information The browsers gather the information from the environment as begin rationalizing and standardizing the raw mountains of meaningless data into the essence of the matter that mathematical explains with quantifiable values what is good bad or redundant. As each HTML is parsed the browser detects Keywords and compares the historical LINK information X Y Z preserved in a Data Warehouse. Then the system uses eigenvectors based on algorithms to normalize quantify and qualify as statistical distribution that permits which discrete group of PAGES I J K or elements of the Superset UI is the most satisfying response to the end user inquiry.

Browsers Organized Information Now that the information has been normalized and standardized the cluster can correlate the data to eliminate bad or incomplete information and through the process of simplification remove the lion share of data which is redundant leaving only exact data that is highly useful and unique. As each link is extracted and valorized for content value of its subordinate PAGES the system places signature values such as I KEYWORD J Frequency K LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERNS X LINK Value Y Reliability and Z Popularity with a mini set or micro universe of the browsers UB limitations to a discrete number of responses n where the cluster cherry picks the discrete sorted by valuing the resultant of the maximized Eigenvector UB with I J K X Y Z characteristics that respond to a simple regular expression inquiry. LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERN valorization method is explained in the new art concerning XCommerce.

Browsers Transform Information As the content of a HTML is converted into Keywords and WORD PATTERNS values all of a sudden the raw meaningless data can be expressed as the primed correlated single version of the truth vector based data with I J K X Y Z independent variables to name a few. Where I J K are the independent variables that analyze the KEYWORD content as it refers to a group of logically organized words used to communicate a message that has been translated into a lingua franca mathematical language that is not confounded. Furthermore possessing X Y Z that independent variables that are used to normalize links within the scope of particular sets that belong to the superset UI that is relational and dimensioned based on quality popularity product and satisfaction patterns of behavior.

Browsers Analyze Information Data Mart means that they reduce complexity to better understand what the end user is searching and augment Keywords LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERNS and LINKS values.

Browsers Evaluate Information Business Intelligence allows the human intelligence to better understand the environment as it relates to each customer.

Browsers Identify Customers From Universal to Personal Understanding personalized means of advertisement have a greater significant impact on persuading an individual to satisfy a craving need

Browsers Target Advertisements Paying the Bills Corporate advertiser must be able to use the Internet as a new method to reach the public that is better than traditional mass media technology.

Browsers Corporate Sponsors Value cost justifying with results a personalized relationship between the corporate sponsors and customers is generated. This bond of trust and confidence facilitates sales.

Rule 1 UCommerce versions I and II always try to minimize delays duties and costs to service the customer with the best product and the door to door service.

Rule 115 A plurality of Hybrid Pyramid structure searches and Keywords of magnitude 10 to 13 are used to derive the most valuable weighted 100 query responses that make up a Complex Pyramid search with a relative weighted magnitude of 15.

Rule 117 A valid word with a magnitude of 2 or more is considered a Keyword. Thus a set of characters and their associated magnitudes help define the process of converting it into geospatial bitmap data.

Rule 121 When the end user makes a single word request for a Keyword Search with a word with a magnitude of 0 1 2 the system at random replaces the search with a magnitude 5 Keyword.

XCommerce 2010 To derive Simple Hybrid and Complex Pyramid Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling uses quality values to shrinks the size of the environment and uses vector math to add up the relevant KEYWORDS used in the requests and the added GEOSPATIAL and LINGUISTIC KEYWORDS obtained from the collections that were used to create exact magnitude objects.

Rule 134 The process of converting a simple Keyword into a Pyramid Search structure is the process of transforming raw confounded and worthless information into primed standardized geospatial bitmap data. W RANK method takes into account the human capacity to measure and understand quality for discrete quantities such 10 to 100 responses.

Rule 135 A Keyword that is transformed into geospatial bitmap data will possess a higher magnitude value. W RANK method takes into account the human nature that considers time as money whereas it can be amusing to have a query response with millions responses they don t want to have to distill analyze and find on their own the most valuable answer.

Rule 136 The system reads the entire content of the Superset U and determines for each link the valid languages such as English French Germany or Spanish to name a few. The algorithm then determines the language of each page belonging to a link.

Rule 138 A Keyword is compared against a language identifier dictionary and also to corporate technology and mathematical geospatial libraries.

Rule 140 The system uses Keyword Validation filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 0 to 6 Keywords or Simple Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings. The weighted algorithm ranks the content of the document versus a given language standard from 0 to 10000.

Rule 141 Pages that have a value less than the language limit are not considered to belong to that language.

Rule 142 Pages that have a value greater than the language limit and below the language structural limit are confounded. 0 Pages are eliminated from the process.

Rule 143 The system reads the content of a Page to derive basic linguistic and geospatial characteristics.

Rule 144 The system performs a Keyword Value filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 7 to 10 Keywords or Hybrid Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings.

Rule 145 The system performs a Keyword Quality filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 11 to 14 Keywords or Complex Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings.

Rule 146 The Keyword Value and Keyword Quality filtering algorithms results are converted into environmental bitmap data from the point of view of a subset U where the common denominator element is the primary Keyword.

Rule 147 The Keyword Validation mechanism identifies if the data belongs to a language and if it is valid or invalid.

A Macro Order permits the supplier system to have the capacity to partially match merge the contents of several distinct orders belonging to a plurality of end users to take advantage of economies of scale.

Let s suppose that a given product such as HD TV is sold in massive scale 20 000 units per day and its supplier is located in Japan. For the purchase of a single HD TV the P U X FOB TYO is 699 and P U Y CDIF is 999 699 FOB TYO 100 Shipping TYO MIA via Ocean 150 customs 50 UCommerce Shipping and Handling with delivery in 4 weeks.

Buying in bulk 20 000 units the supplier X FOB price to UCommerce TYO is 549 or 699 minus 20 discount 

The product weight is 20 lbs. Thus the UCommerce by purchasing in behalf of the 20 000 end users with common denominator Leg A TYO and Leg T Miami can create two Macro Orders that offer optimal P U to the end users 

1 Macro Order Leg A has a X FOB Price UCommerce TYO of 549 significantly reducing the cost to the end user by 150.

Thus the end users significantly lower their aggregate cost of FOB or CDIF costs and with optional shorter time delays and improved services such as GOLD LABEL when required for an emergency spare part.

Z PRICE Z PRICE permits an end user the best price door to door. For example an end user living in Sao Paolo Brazil wants to purchase a single HD TV. If the end user purchases a single item via direct method the cost would be P U X FOB TYO 699 P U X FOB MIA 949 and P U Y CDIF SAO 1 249. Instead the end user allows each UCommerce system and method to find the best price based on time delays 

1 Macro Order Leg A has a X FOB Price UCommerce TYO of 549 significantly reducing the cost to the end user by 150.

Note c g X FOB Y CDIF pricing has already taken into account 115 for customs declarations since the merchandise is handled via Free Trade Zones.

Classical Divide and Conquer Browser Search Is a description of how to use the present 3party prior art to derive an optimal query response. For example an end user wants to find out the World Cup Final match between France and Italy in Germany Jul. 9 2006 

1 Let s assume the end user did not go directly to a favorite sports site that has previously stored in his browser.

5 Note 2 4 the browser will suggest the use www.fifa.com still the end user must find the information within easy during the tournament not 6 months after the fact when League Tournaments Olympic Women World Cup soccer event dominate the spotlight.

6 The Simple Pyramid Structure validates and filters out WORLD CUP FIFA 16 000 000 responses minus 90 redundancy or pork equals 1 600 000 responses still the end user is not satisfied since over a million responses exist or is not impressed using 1 www.favoritesite.com or 5 www.fifa.com using the KEYWORD regular expression WORLD CUP FIFA and English language only.

9 The end user requests the KEYWORD CHAMPION that has 500 000 responses. Fact Italy is the FIFA Germany 2006 World CUP Champion. This logically eliminates the need to use France since they are runners up and any news making reference to the final in future tense.

10 The Hybrid Pyramid Structure validates and filters out GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION 500 000 responses minus 50 redundancy or pork equals 250 000 responses

13 The end user requests the KEYWORD PENALTY that has 25 000 responses. Fact Z. Z. was given a red card and ejected from the game he was also awarded the Golden Ball award for being the best tournament player and his team France lost the final in penalty kicks.

14 The Hybrid Pyramid Structure that validates and filters out RED GOLDEN PENALTY 25 000 responses minus 50 redundancy or pork equals 12 500 responses.

Pyramid Structures Browser Search Analysis The XCommerce supplier system is responsible for creating the Informational Pyramid Structures for FIFA content which includes the World Cup and League Tournaments.

Simple Pyramid Calculations using Simple Pyramid collections of Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling to create 1 000 000 cells 

Hybrid Pyramid Calculations using Hybrid Pyramid collections of Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling to create 10 000 cells 

World and Cup regular expression have a magnitude 0 or 1 and thus are not considered Keywords whereas FIFA with a magnitude 2 is.

Simple Pyramid Constructs based on the Simple Pyramid Structure constructs the system top objects consists of the following 

Thus using the player collection for example Diego Armando Maradona can be associated as a player that played for Boca Juniors Argentina Barcelona Spain and Napoli Italy. In particular Zidane can be associated as a player that played for Bordeaux in France Juventus in Italy and Real Madrid in Spain. Boca Juniors Real Madrid and Napoli are members of the Teams collections. Both Maradona and Zidane won the Adidas Golden Ball 1986 and 2006 respectively.

Complex Pyramid Calculations using Complex Pyramid collections of Joins Blocks Walls and Ceiling to create 100 cells WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION RED GOLD PENALTY ZIDANE BUFFON CANNAVARO SHAKIRA have a magnitude of 15.

XCommerce 2010 Simple Hybrid and Complex collections have at there disposal the same English language semantics KEYWORDS nevertheless the use different quality values to create objects of exact magnitudes.

Is a comparative analysis of 3parties Browser Search Engines versus the W RANK The Basic Keyword search WORLD CUP FIFA versus the Simple Pyramid Structure. The End user begins the Divide and Conquer process of placing enough words until a satisfying response is encountered.

Simple Pyramid Structure W RANK Calculations The Simple Pyramid Structure for WORLD CUP FIFA is a process that logically associates other valuable common denominator KEYWORDS to derive to the optimal element.

2 The System uses Simple Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings English Semantics to further valorize each of the links and to associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 1 000 000 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

Note 2 to 9 consists of a preprocessed task done to all of the pages of the Internet having a given language content in this case English. As per Examples 3 and 4 only FIFA is a KEYWORD. Primary word is WORLD. Secondary word is CUP. Tertiary word is FIFA.

Hybrid Pyramid Structure W RANK Calculations the Intermediate Keyword search WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION versus the Hybrid Pyramid Structure. The End user begins the Divide and Conquer process of placing enough words until the Browser Engine responds with a satisfying response.

The Hybrid Pyramid Structure for WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION is a process that logically associates other valuable common denominator KEYWORDS to derive to the optimal element.

7 The System uses Hybrid Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings English Semantics by paragraph to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 10 000 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

Hybrid Pyramid Valorization Means The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 500 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA or WORLD CUP FIFA are valid.

As per Examples 3 and 4 only CHAMPION is a KEYWORD. For the second filter the Primary word is GERMANY. Secondary word is ITALY. Tertiary word is CHAMPION.

Hybrid Pyramid Construct Test A Hybrid Pyramid Construct test is based on the unique number of words in a given page. The system match merges common denominator 1 to 256 Hybrid Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings out of the most likely 1024 comparisons.

8 The System uses Complex Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings Data and Geospatial data by content to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 100 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

9 The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 3 000 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION or HYBRID or HYBRID PYRAMID combinations are valid.

As per Examples 3 and 4 none are KEYWORDS. For the third filter the Primary word is RED. Secondary word is GOLD. Tertiary word is PENALTY.

Complex Pyramid Construct Test A Complex Pyramid Construct test is based on the unique number of words in a given page. The system match merges common denominator 1 to 256 Complex Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings out of the most likely 1024 comparisons.

10 Finally after the system has match merged the Complex Pyramid Switch the system identifies the highest satisfying KEYWORD to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to the TOP ten cell. Thus the 11 cells have the 2.5 billion responses. The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 10 000 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION RED GOLD PENALTY or COMPLEX or COMPLEX PYRAMID combinations are valid.

Shows how the W RANK differs from the 3party browser engines When the end user makes a request such as WORLD CUP FIFA the query requires the 8 8 cluster to perform an eigenvector search to derive the highest valued replies to the end user. Whereas W RANK identifies the HQ1 owner of the FIFA KEYWORD Environmental Bitmap Pyramid Structure for the result without performing any calculations since the data within the supplier system is current. Finally W RANK uses a weighted algorithm instead a Regular Expression filtering mechanism or Caesar s Divide and Conquer strategy as shown in the Examples 3 to 5.
