title: System and method for managing information technology models in an intelligent workload management system
abstract: The system and method described herein for managing information technology models in an intelligent workload management system may include a computing environment having a model-driven, service-oriented architecture for creating collaborative threads to manage workloads. In particular, the management threads may converge information for managing planned changes and recovery processes for version-controlled snapshots of the information technology models. For example, a discovery engine may enrich models of an infrastructure with identity information obtained from an identity vault and the infrastructure itself, and a management infrastructure may then manage planned changes to the infrastructure model. In particular, the management infrastructure may construct implementation plans that coordinate interaction between managed entities to implement the planned changes, and may further detect drifts between operational states and planned states for the infrastructure models.

The invention relates to a system and method for managing information technology models in an intelligent workload management system and in particular to a computing environment having a model driven service oriented architecture for creating collaborative threads to manage workloads wherein the management threads may converge information for managing planned changes and recovery processes for version controlled snapshots of the information technology models.

 Cloud computing generally refers to a computing environment with dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources which are typically provided as services over the Internet. For example cloud computing environments often employ the concept of virtualization as a preferred paradigm for hosting workloads on any appropriate hardware. The cloud computing model has become increasingly viable for many enterprises for various reasons including that the cloud infrastructure may permit information technology resources to be treated as utilities that can be automatically provisioned on demand while also limiting the cost of services to actual resource consumption. Moreover consumers of resources provided in cloud computing environments can leverage technologies that might otherwise be unavailable. Thus as cloud computing and cloud storage become more pervasive many enterprises will find that moving data center to cloud providers can yield economies of scale among other advantages.

However while much of the information technology industry moves toward cloud computing and virtualization environments existing systems tend to fall short in adequately addressing concerns relating to managing or controlling workloads and storage in such environments. For example cloud computing environments are generally designed to support generic business practices meaning that individuals and organizations typically lack the ability to change many aspects of the platform. Moreover concerns regarding performance latency reliability and security present significant challenges as outages and downtime can lead to lost business opportunities and decreased productivity while the generic platform may present governance risk and compliance concerns. In other words once organizations deploy workloads beyond the boundaries of their data centers lack of visibility into the computing environment may result in significant management problems.

While these types of problems tend to be pervasive in cloud computing and virtualization environments due to the lack of transparency existing systems for managing and controlling workloads that are physically deployed and or locally deployed in home data centers tend to suffer from many similar problems. In particular information technology has traditionally been managed in silos of automation which are often disconnected from one another. For example help desk systems typically involve a customer submitting a trouble ticket to a remedy system with a human operator then using various tools to address the problem and close the ticket while monitoring systems that watch the infrastructure to remediate problems may remain isolated from the interaction between the customer and the help desk despite such interaction being relevant to the monitoring system s function.

As such because existing systems for managing infrastructure workloads operate within distinct silos that typically do not communicate with one another context that has been exchanged between two entities can often be lost when the workload moves to the next step in the chain. When issues surrounding workload management are considered in the context of business objectives wherein information technology processes and business issues collectively drive transitions from one silo to another modern business tends to move at a speed that outpaces information technology s ability to serve business needs. Although emerging trends in virtualization cloud computing appliances and other models for delivering services have the potential to allow information technology to catch up with the speed of business many businesses lack the knowledge needed to intelligently implement these new technologies.

For example emerging service delivery models often lead to deployed services being composed and aggregated in new and unexpected ways. In particular rather than designing and modeling systems from the ground up new functionality is often generated on the fly with complex building blocks that tend to include various services and applications that have traditionally been isolated and stand alone. As such even though many emerging service delivery models provide administrators and users with a wider range of information technology choices than have ever before been available the diversity in technology often compounds business problems and increases the demand for an agile infrastructure. Thus despite the advantages and promise that new service delivery models can offer businesses existing systems tend to fall short in providing information technology tools that can inform businesses on how to intelligently implement an information technology infrastructure in a manner that best leverage available technology to suit the particular needs of a business.

According to one aspect of the invention a system and method for intelligent workload management may generally provide a computing environment having a fluid architecture whereby the computing environment may create common threads to manage workloads that converge information relating to user identities and access credentials provisioned and requested services and physical and virtual infrastructure resources among other things. In one implementation services provided in the computing environment may generally include various aggregated physical and or virtual resources while applications may include various aggregated services and workloads may include various compositions of whole services separate services and or sub services that work together. For example in response to a user requesting a service that performs a particular function or application the intelligent workload management system or alternatively the workload management system may create a workload to manage provisioning the user with a tuned appliance configured to perform the particular function or application whereby the tuned appliance may provide the requested service for the user. To manage the workload the workload management system may create a resource store that points to a storage location for the appliance declare a service level agreement and any runtime requirements that constrain deployment for the appliance obtain a certificate that provides attestation tokens for the user and the appliance and create a profile that provides an audit trail of actual lifecycle behavior for the appliance e.g. events and performance metrics relating to the appliance . Thus workflows created in the computing environment may converge various sources of information within a common thread which the workload management system may use to manage the workload e.g. actual metrics for a particular workload can be compared to anticipated metrics for the workload to determine whether various services underlying the workload function as intended .

According to one aspect of the invention the system and method for intelligent workload management may operate in a model driven architecture which may merge information relating to user identities with services that may be running in an information technology infrastructure. As such the information merged in the model driven architecture may be referenced to determine specific users or organizational areas within the infrastructure that may be impacted in response to a particular change to the infrastructure model. Thus whereas information technology has traditionally been managed within disparate silos where context exchanged between any two entities may be lost at the next step in the chain the model driven architecture may track context for information technology workloads from start to finish. As such tracking context for the information technology workloads may provide audit trails that can then be used to identify a relevant user application system or other entity that can provide assistance with a particular issue. Moreover in the context of managing workloads for virtualized services where different users typically have to communicate with one another on demand the audit trail that the model driven architecture enables may track end to end workload activities and thereby provide visibility and notice to users applications systems services or any other suitable entity that may be impacted by the workload.

According to one aspect of the invention the system and method for intelligent workload management may enable agile and flexible management for an information technology infrastructure which may enable the infrastructure to move at the speed of modern business. For example the system and method for intelligent workload management may further operate in a service oriented architecture unifying various heterogeneous technologies which may provide businesses with the capability to deploy information technology resources in a manner that can meet business objectives. For example the service oriented architecture may provide adaptable interoperable and user friendly information technology tools to manage the infrastructure in a manner that addresses many typical business challenges that information technology organizations face. For example while the model driven architecture may employ virtualization features to provide manageable workloads that can move efficiently through the infrastructure the service oriented architecture may merge different technologies to provide various coordinated systems that can cooperate to optimally execute portions of an overall orchestrated workload. As such the model driven and service oriented architectures may collectively derive data from the information technology infrastructure which may inform intelligent information technology choices that meet the needs of businesses and users.

According to one aspect of the invention the system and method for intelligent workload management may be used to manage workloads created in response to service requests. For example any suitable user application system or other entities may request a service from the workload management system wherein the request may include a desired performance level or service level for the service any components or criteria required for the service comments to provision the service in a certain manner or any other suitable information for the requested service. In response to receiving the service request human and or automated approvers or service delivery managers may collaboratively manage the service request and determine whether the service can be provisioned as requested. Furthermore the approvers may provide feedback on the service provisioning decision which may create an interactive collaborative conversation between requesters approvers and other entities in the management thread. In one implementation various security policies may be built into the model to automatically approve or deny certain requests wherein the security policies may be dynamically updated in response to handling similar requests e.g. a request for Bit Torrent storage may be automatically denied because a particular security policy indicates that peer to peer file sharing violates a company policy .

According to one aspect of the invention services provisioned in the workload management system may include any suitable combination of physical infrastructure resources and virtualized infrastructure resources. For example to provision virtualized services that can abstract underlying physical platforms and share computing resources in a manner that may address many needs for immediacy in business environments the workload management system may manage physical infrastructure resources and virtualized infrastructure resources to support provisioning virtualized services. Thus the service oriented architecture employed in the workload management system may enable management for the physical infrastructure resources e.g. rack mounting configuring and otherwise physically installing servers storage resources and other devices and may further enable management for the virtualized infrastructure resources e.g. pre configuring provisioned services with identity management features denying flagging or auditing service requests from unauthorized entities etc. . Moreover the workload management system may be considered a service in that the workload management service may be built dynamically in response to service requests e.g. because a management infrastructure can introduce computational burdens just as any other resource limiting the existence of the workload management infrastructure to an on demand service can free computational resources for other tasks having a greater need for immediacy .

According to one aspect of the invention to manage collaborative service provisioning in contexts that combine physical and virtualized resources the workload management system may store a history of interaction between requesters approvers and other entities in service provisioning threads and may further record log and save traffic and activity between such entities in the service provisioning threads. As such various processes that occur during service provisioning may be recorded and injected into a real time stream that can subsequently be played back thereby capturing the service provisioning processes as a whole including any responses that human and or automated entities may provide during the collaborative process. During processes for collaboratively managing the information technology infrastructure the workload management system may expose portions of the infrastructure model to entities involved in the management processes. In one implementation the workload management system may expose just enough context to entities involved in the management processes whereby the involved entities may view the respective portions of the infrastructure model for which such entities have management responsibility e.g. prior to implementing any particular change to the infrastructure the workload management system may query the model and determine an impact of the change notify impacted entities etc. .

According to one aspect of the invention virtualized services provisioned in the workload management system may further include injection points for adding and or removing information from the provisioned services. For example any particular virtualized service may generally include a layered architecture that includes injection points for inserting zero residue management agents that can manage the service and ensure that the service functions correctly. Thus in one implementation zero residue management agents may be inserted within virtualized services at build time run time or any other suitable point in a lifecycle for the virtualized services wherein the particular management agents inserted within the virtualized services may depend on a type of management required. For example the workload management system may analyze a configuration of the service a lifecycle point for the service or other suitable information for the service to derive a recipe of the management agents to be injected e.g. the recipe may depend on a required service level for the service a current operational state for the infrastructure model services running in the infrastructure a type of management required for the running services etc. .

Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the following drawings and detailed description.

According to one aspect of the invention illustrates an exemplary model driven architecture A in a system for intelligent workload management while illustrates an exemplary service oriented architecture B in the system for intelligent workload management. In one implementation the model driven architecture A shown in and the service oriented architecture B shown in may include various components that operate in a substantially similar manner to provide the functionality that will be described in further detail herein. Thus any description provided herein for components having identical reference numerals in will be understood as corresponding to such components in both whether or not explicitly described.

In one implementation the model driven architecture A illustrated in and the service oriented architecture B illustrated in may provide an agile responsive reliable and interoperable information technology environment which may address various problems associated with managing an information technology infrastructure e.g. growing revenues and cutting costs managing governance risk and compliance reducing times to innovate and deliver products to markets enforcing security and access controls managing heterogeneous technologies and information flows etc. . To that end the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may provide a coordinated design for the intelligent workload management system or alternatively the workload management system wherein the coordinated design may integrate technologies for managing identities enforcing policies assuring compliance managing computing and storage environments providing orchestrated virtualization enabling collaboration and providing architectural agility among other things. The model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may therefore provide a flexible framework that may enable the workload management system to allocate various resources in the information technology infrastructure in a manner that balances governance risk and compliance with capacities for internal and external resources . For example as will be described in further detail herein the workload management system may operate within the flexible framework that the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B to deliver information technology tools for managing security performance availability and policy objectives for services provisioned in the information technology infrastructure .

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may enable managing identities in the information technology infrastructure . In particular managing identities may present an important concern in the context of managing services in the information technology infrastructure because security performance availability policy objectives and other variables may have different importance for different users customers applications systems or other resources that operate in the information technology infrastructure . As such the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may include various components that enable identity management in the information technology infrastructure .

For example in one implementation the workload management system may include an access manager e.g. Novell Access Manager which may communicate with an identity vault and control access to content applications services and other resources in the information technology infrastructure . In one implementation the access manager may enforce various policy declarations to provide authentication services for any suitable component in the information technology infrastructure . For example the identity vault may include various directories that organize user accounts roles policies and other identity information that the access manager can reference to generate authorization decisions. The access manager and the identity vault may further support federated user identities wherein a user at any particular client resource may submit single sign on authentication credentials to the access manager which may then control access to any suitable resource in the information technology infrastructure with the single sign on authentication credentials e.g. user names identifiers passwords smart cards biometrics etc. . Moreover the identity information stored in the identity vault may be provided to a synchronization engine whereby the synchronization engine may provide interoperable and transportable identity information throughout the architecture e.g. via an identity fabric within an event bus that manages transport throughout the architecture .

In one implementation providing the identity information stored in the identity vault to the synchronization engine may form portable identities that correspond to independent digital representations for various users applications systems or other entities that interact with the information technology infrastructure . In particular the identities maintained in the synchronization engine may generally include abstractions that can provide access to authoritative attributes active roles and valid policies for entities that the identity abstractions represent. Thus synchronizing the identity information stored in the identity vault with the synchronization engine may provide independent and scalable digital identities that can be transported across heterogeneous applications services networks or other systems whereby the workload management system may handle and validate the digital identities in a cooperative interoperable and federated manner.

In one implementation the identities stored in the identity vault and synchronized with the synchronization engine may be customized to define particular attributes and roles that the identities may expose. For example a user may choose to create one identity that exposes every attribute and role for the user to applications services or other systems that reside within organizational boundaries another identity that limits the attributes and roles exposed to certain service providers outside the organizational boundaries and another identity that provides complete anonymity in certain contexts. The identities maintained in the synchronization engine may therefore provide awareness over any authentication criteria that may be required to enable communication and collaboration between entities that interact with the workload management system. For example the synchronization engine may include a service that can enforce policies controlling whether certain information stored in the identity vault can be shared e.g. through the access manager or other information technology tools that can manage and customize identities .

In one implementation the workload management system may further manage identities in a manner that enables infrastructure workloads to function across organizational boundaries wherein identities for various users applications services and other resources involved in infrastructure workloads may be managed with role aggregation policies and logic that can support federated authentication authorization and attribute services. For example in one implementation the access manager the identity vault and the synchronization engine may manage identity services externally to applications services and other resources that consume the identities which may enable the workload management system to control access to services for multiple applications using consistent identity interfaces. In particular the access manager the identity vault and the synchronization engine may define standard interfaces for managing the identity services which may include authentication services push authorization services e.g. tokens claims assertions etc. pull authorization services e.g. requests queries etc. push attribute services e.g. updates pull attribute services e.g. queries and audit services.

As such in one implementation the workload management system may employ the identity services provided in the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B to apply policies for representing and controlling roles for multiple identities within any particular session that occurs in the information technology infrastructure . For example in response to a session that includes a user logging into a client machine and invoking a backup service the workload management system may manage the session with multiple identities that encompass the user the backup service and the client machine . The workload management system may further determine that the identity for the client machine represents an unsecured machine that resides outside an organizational firewall which may result in the workload management system retrieving a policy from the identity vault and or the synchronization engine and applying the policy to the session e.g. the policy may dynamically prevent the machine and the user from being active in the same session . Thus the workload management system may manage multiple identities that may be involved in any particular service request to control and secure access to applications services and other resources in the information technology infrastructure .

In one implementation the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may further provide identity services for delegating rights in delegation chains that may involve various different levels of identities. In particular any particular user may have various roles attributes or other identities that define various rights for the user. As such in one implementation the rights delegation identity service may enable the user to delegate a time bounded subset of such rights to a particular service wherein the service can then make requests to other services on behalf of the user during the delegated time. For example a user may delegate rights to a backup service that permits the backup service to read a portion of a clustered file system during a particular time interval e.g. 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. . In response to the file system receiving the read request from the backup service the identity services may enable the file system to audit identities for the backup service and the user and further to constrain read permissions within the file system based on the relevant rights defined by the identities for the backup service for the user.

In one implementation the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may further provide identity services for defining relative roles wherein relative roles may be defined where a principal user application service or other entity can only assume a particular role for a particular action when a target of the action has a particular set of identities. For example a user having a doctor role may only assume a doctor of record relative role if an identity for a target of the doctor of record action refers to one of the user s patients. In another example applications may request controlled access to information about an identity for a certain user wherein the application may retrieve the requested information directly from the access controlled identity for the user. In particular the workload management system may determine the information requested by the application and create a workload that indicates to the user the information requested by the application and any action that the application may initiate with the requested information. The user may then make an informed choice about whether to grant the application access to the requested information. Thus having identities to enable applications may eliminate a need for application specific data storage or having the application access separate a directory service or another identity information source.

Thus in the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B the identity management services may create crafted identities combined from various different types of identity information for various users applications services systems or other information technology resources . In one implementation while the identity information may generally be stored and maintained in the identity vault the identity information can be composed and transformed through the access manager and or the synchronization engine with the resulting identity information providing authoritative statements for represented entities that span multiple authentication domains within and or beyond boundaries for the information technology infrastructure . For example an identity for a user may be encapsulated within a token that masks any underlying credential authentication identity federation and attribute attestation. Moreover in one implementation the identity services may further support identities that outlive entities that the identities represent and multiple identity subsets within a particular identity domain or across multiple identity domains. As such the identity services provided in the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may include various forms of authentication identifier mapping token transformation identity attribute management and identity relationship mapping.

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may enable enforcing policies in the information technology infrastructure . In particular enforcing policies may present an important concern in the context of managing services in the information technology infrastructure because policies may be driven from multiple hierarchies and depend on operational legislative and organizational requirements that can overlap contradict and or override each other. As such the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may include various components for defining policies in standardized languages that can be translated merged split or otherwise unified as needed. To that end the workload management system may have multiple policy decision points and policy definition services for consistently managing and enforcing policies in the information technology infrastructure

As such in one implementation the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may provide standard policy languages and service interfaces that enable the workload management system to make consistent decisions based on flexible user needs. In particular any suitable resource including workloads and computational infrastructure may be provided with access to standardized instrumentation that provides knowledge regarding information that may be available desired or allowed in the workload management system. In one implementation the workload management system may invoke various cooperating policy services to determine suitable physical resources e.g. physical servers hardware devices etc. virtualized resources e.g. virtual machine images virtualized servers etc. configuration resources e.g. management agents translation services etc. storage resources e.g. the clustered file system one or more databases etc. or other resources for a particular workload. For example the synchronization engine may dynamically retrieve various policies stored in the databases and an event audit service may then evaluate the policies maintained in the synchronization engine independently from services that subsequently enforce policy decisions e.g. the event audit service may determine whether the policies permit access to certain information for a particular application and the application may then enforce the policy determination .

In one implementation separating policy evaluation within the event audit service from policy enforcement within consuming services may enable the workload management system to access the consuming services and manage policy based control for the service in an independent and simultaneous manner. The event audit service may include a standardized policy definition service that can be used to define policies that span multiple separate application and management domains. For example in one implementation the policy definition service may create manage translate and or process policies separately from other service administration domains and interfaces. As such the policy definition service may provide interoperability for the separate domains and interfaces and may further enable compliance services that may be provided in a correlation system and remediation services that may be provided in a workload service

In one implementation to ensure correct and effective policy decisions the policy definition service provided within the event audit service may be configured to obtain data relating to a current state and configuration for resources managed in the infrastructure in addition to data relating to dependencies or other interactions between the managed resources . For example a management infrastructure may include a discovery engine that dynamically monitors various events that the infrastructure generates and pushes onto the event bus which may include an event backplane for transporting the events. Moreover the discovery engine may query the infrastructure to determine relationships and dependencies among users applications services and other resources in the infrastructure . As such the discovery engine may monitor the event bus to obtain the events generated in the infrastructure and synchronize the events to the synchronization engine and may further synchronize information relating to the relationships and dependencies identified in the infrastructure to the synchronization engine . In one implementation the event audit service may then evaluate any events resource relationships resource dependencies or other information describing the operational state and the configuration state of the infrastructure in view of any relevant policies and subsequently provide any such policy evaluations to requesting entities.

In one implementation the policy definition service may include standard interfaces for defining policies in terms of requirements controls and rules. For example the requirements may generally be expressed in natural language in order to describe permitted functionality prohibited functionality desirable functionality and undesirable functionality among other things e.g. the event audit service may capture legislative regulations business objectives best practices or other policy based requirements expressed in natural language . The controls may generally associate the requirements to particular objects that may be managed in the workload management system such as individual users groups of users physical resources virtualized resources or any other suitable object or resource in the infrastructure . In one implementation the policy definition service may further define types for the controls. For example the type may include an authorization type that associates an identity with a particular resource and action e.g. for certain identities authorizing or denying access to a system or a file permission to alter or deploy a policy etc. or the type may include an obligation type that mandates a particular action for an identity.

Thus in one implementation translating requirements into controls may partition the requirements into multiple controls that may define policies for a particular group of objects. Furthermore rules may apply certain controls to particular resources wherein rules may represent concrete policy definitions. For example the rules may be translated directly into a machine readable and machine executable format that information technology staff may handle and that the event audit service may evaluate in order to manage policies. In one implementation the rules may be captured and expressed in any suitable domain specific language wherein the domain specific language may provide a consistent addressing scheme and data model to instrument policies across multiple domains. For example a definitive software library may include one or more standardized policy libraries for translating between potentially disparate policy implementations which may enable the event audit service to provide federated policies interoperable across multiple different domains. As such the rules that represent the policy definitions may include identifiers for an originating policy implementation which the policy definition service may then map to the controls that the rules enforce and to the domain specific policy language used in the workload management system e.g. through the definitive software library .

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may enable monitoring for compliance assurances in the information technology infrastructure . In particular compliance assurance may present an important concern in the context of managing services in the information technology infrastructure because policy enforcement encompasses issues beyond location access rights or other contextual information within the infrastructure e.g. due to increasing mobility in computing environments . As such the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may define metadata that bounds data to characteristics of data. To that end the workload management system may employ a standard metadata format to provide interoperability between policies from multiple organizations to enable the policies to cooperate with one another and provide policy based service control. For example certain infrastructure workloads may execute under multiple constraints defined by users the infrastructure sponsoring organizations or other entities wherein compliance assurance may provide users with certification that the workloads were properly assigned and executed according to the constraints. In another example sponsoring organizations and governing bodies may define control policies that constrain workloads wherein compliance assurance in this context may include ensuring that only authorized workloads have been executed against approved resources .

As such in one implementation the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may provide preventative compliance assurance through a compliance management service that supports remediation in addition to monitoring and reporting. For example when workloads move from data centers internal to the infrastructure into third party processing centers cloud computing environments or other environments having reusable computing resource pools where services can be relocated the workload management system may generate compliance reports that indicate whether any constraints defined for the workloads have been satisfied e.g. that authorized entities perform the correct work in the correct manner as defined within the workloads . Thus compliance may generally be defined to include measuring and reporting on whether certain policies effectively ensure confidentiality and availability for information within workloads wherein the resulting compliance reports may describe an entire process flow that encompasses policy definition relationships between configurations and activities that do or do not comply with the defined policies and identities of users applications services systems or other resources involved in the process flow.

In one implementation the workload management system may provide the compliance management service for workloads having specifications defined by users and further for workloads having specifications defined by organizations. For example users may generally define various specifications to identify operational constraints and desired outcomes for workloads that the users create wherein the compliance management service may certify to the users whether or not the operational constraints and desired outcomes have been correctly implemented. With respect to organizational workloads organizations may define various specifications identifying operational constraints and desired outcomes for ensuring that workloads comply with governmental regulations corporate best practices contracts laws and internal codes of conduct. Thus the compliance management service may integrate the identity management services and the policy definition service described above to provide the workload management system with control over configurations compliance event coverage and remediation services in the information technology infrastructure .

In one implementation the compliance management service may operate within a workload engine provided within the management infrastructure and or a workload service in communication with the synchronization engine . The workload engine and or the workload service may therefore execute the compliance management service to measure and report on whether workloads comply with relevant policies and further to remediate any non compliant workloads. For example the compliance management service may use the integrated identity management services to measure and report on users applications services systems or other resources that may be performing operational activity that occurs in the information technology infrastructure . In particular the compliance management service may interact with the access manager the identity vault the synchronization engine or any other suitable source that provides federated identity information to retrieve identities for the entities performing the operational activity validate the identities determine relationships between the identities and otherwise map the identities to the operational activity. For example in one implementation the correlation system may provide analytic services to process audit trails for any suitable resource e.g. correlating the audit trails and then mapping certain activities to identities for resources involved in the activities . Furthermore in response to the correlation system processing the audit trails and determining that certain policies have been violated the correlation system may invoke one or more automated remediation workloads to initiate appropriate action for addressing the policy violations.

In one implementation the compliance management service may further use the integrated policy definition service to monitor and report on the operational activity that occurs in the information technology infrastructure and any policy evaluation determinations that the event audit service generates through the policy definition service. For example in one implementation the workload engine and or the workload service may retrieve information from a configuration management database or other databases that provide federated configuration information for managing the resources in the information technology infrastructure . The workload engine and or the workload service may therefore execute the compliance management service to perform scheduled and multi step compliance processing wherein the compliance processing may include correlating operational activities with identities and evaluating policies that may span various different policy domains in order to govern the information technology infrastructure . To that end the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may provide various compliance management models may be used in the compliance management service.

In one implementation the compliance management models may include a wrapped compliance management model that manages resources lacking internal awareness over policy based controls. The compliance management service may augment the resources managed in the wrapped compliance model with one or more policy decision points and or policy enforcement points that reside externally to the managed resources e.g. the event audit service . For example the policy decision points and or the policy enforcement points may intercept any requests directed to the resources managed in the wrapped compliance model generate policy decisions that indicate whether the resources can properly perform the requests and then enforce the policy decisions e.g. forwarding the requests to the resources in response to determining that the resources can properly perform the requests denying the requests in response to determining that the resources can properly perform the requests etc. . Thus because the resources managed in the wrapped compliance model generally perform any requests that the resources receive without considering policy based controls or compliance issues the event audit service may further execute the compliance management service to wrap coordinate and synthesize an audit trail that includes data obtained from the managed resources and the wrapping policy definition service.

In one implementation the compliance management models may include a delegated compliance management model to manage resources that implement a policy enforcement point and reference an external policy decision point wherein the resources managed in the delegated compliance management model may have limited internal awareness over policy based controls. As such in one implementation the compliance management service may interleave policy decisions or other control operations generated by the external policy decision point with the internally implemented policy enforcement point to provide compliance assurance for the resources managed in the delegated compliance management model. The delegated compliance management model may therefore represent a hybrid compliance model which may apply to any suitable service that simultaneously anticipates compliance instrumentation but lacks internal policy control abstractions e.g. the internally implemented policy enforcement point may anticipate the compliance instrumentation while the externally referenced policy decision point has the relevant policy control abstractions . Thus in the delegated compliance management model the compliance management service may have fewer objects to coordinate than in the wrapped compliance management model but the event audit service may nonetheless execute the compliance management service to coordinate and synthesize an audit trail that includes data obtained from the managed resources and the delegated external policy decision point.

In one implementation the compliance management models may include an embedded compliance management model that manages resources that internally implement policy enforcement points and policy decision points wherein the resources managed in the embedded compliance management model may have full internal awareness over policy based controls. As such in one implementation the resources managed in the embedded compliance management model may employ the internally implemented policy enforcement points and policy decision points to instrument any service and control operations for requests directed to the resources . In one implementation to provide flexible compliance assurance resources managed in the embedded compliance management model may expose configuration or customization options via an externalized policy administration point. Thus the embedded compliance management model may provide an integrated and effective audit trail for compliance assurance which may often leave the compliance management service free to perform other compliance assurance processes.

Accordingly in one implementation the compliance management service may obtain information for any resource managed in the information technology infrastructure from the configuration management database or other databases that include a federated namespace for the managed resources configurations for the managed resources and relationships among the managed resources . In addition the compliance management service may reference the configuration management database or other the databases to arbitrate configuration management in the infrastructure and record previous configurations histories for the resources in the configuration management database or other databases . As such the compliance management service may generally maintain information relating to identities configurations and relationships for the managed resources which may provide a comparison context for analyzing subsequent requests to change the infrastructure and identifying information technology services that the requested changes may impact.

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may include managing computing and storage environments that support services in the infrastructure . In particular in one implementation the computing and storage environments used to support services in the infrastructure may employ Linux operating environments which may generally include an operating system distribution with a Linux kernel and various open source packages e.g. gcc glibc etc. that collectively provide the Linux operating environments. In one implementation the Linux operating environments may generally provide a partitioned distribution model for managing the computing and storage environments employed in the workload management system. Further in one implementation a particular Linux distribution may be bundled for operating environments pre installed in the workload management system e.g. openSUSE SUSE Linux Enterprise etc. which may enable vendors of physical hardware resources to support every operating system that the vendors customers employ without overhead that may introduced with multiple pre installed operating environment choices.

In one implementation the partitioned distribution model may partition the Linux operating environments into a physical hardware distribution often referred to as a pDistro which may include physical resources that run over hardware to provide a physical hosting environment for virtual machines . For example in one implementation the physical hardware distribution may include the Linux kernel and various hypervisor technologies that can run the virtual machines over the underlying physical hosting environment wherein the physical hardware distribution may be certified for existing and future developed hardware environments to enable the workload management system to support future advances in the Linux kernel and or hypervisor technologies. Alternatively or additionally the workload management system may release the physical hardware distribution in a full Linux distribution version to provide users with the ability to take advantage of future advances in technologies at a faster release cycle.

In one implementation the partitioned distribution model may further partition the Linux operating environments into a virtual software distribution often referred to as a vDistro which may include virtual machines deployed for specific applications or services that run enable and otherwise support workloads. More particularly any particular virtual software distribution may generally include one or more Linux package or pattern deployments whereby the virtual machines may include virtual machines images with just enough operating system JeOS to support the package or pattern deployments needed to run the applications or services for the workloads. In one implementation the virtual software distribution may include a particular Linux product e.g. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server bundled with hardware agnostic virtual drivers which may provide configuration resources for tuning virtualized resources for optimized performance.

In one implementation the particular virtual software distribution may be certified for governmental security requirements and for certain application vendors which may enable the workload management system to update any physical resources in the physical hardware distribution underlying the virtual software distribution without compromising support contracts with such vendors. In particular in response to future changes in technology that may improve support for Linux operating environments resulting improvements may occur in techniques for building and deploying Linux operating environments. Thus where many application vendors currently tend to only provide support for certain Linux applications that run in certain Linux versions the workload management system may enable support for any particular Linux application or version which may drive Linux integration and adoption across the information technology infrastructure . In one implementation for example the workload management system may employ Linux applications and distributions created using a build system that enables any suitable application to be built and tested on different versions of Linux distributions e.g. an openSUSE Build Service SUSE Studio etc. . For example in response to receiving a request that includes unique specifications for a particular Linux application the workload management system may notify distribution developers to include such specifications in the application with the specifications then being made available to other application developers.

Thus in one implementation the Linux build system employed in the workload management system may enable distribution engineers and developers to detect whether changes to subsequent application releases conflict with or otherwise break existing applications. In particular changes in systems compiler versions dependent libraries or other resources may cause errors in the subsequent application releases wherein commonly employing the Linux build system throughout the workload management system may provide standardized application support. For example in one implementation the workload management system may employ certified implementations of the Linux Standard Base LSB which may enable independent software vendors ISVs to verify compliance and may further provide various support services that can provide policy based automated remediation for the Linux operating environments through the LSB Open Cluster Framework OCF .

In one implementation the Linux operating environments in the workload management system may provide engines that support orchestrated virtualization collaboration and architectural agility as will be described in greater detail below. Further to manage identities enforce policies and assure compliance the Linux operating environments may include a syslog infrastructure that coordinate and manages various internal auditing requirements while the workload management system may further provide an audit agent to augment the internal auditing capabilities that the syslog infrastructure provides e.g. the audit agent may operate within the event audit service to uniformly manage the Linux kernel the identity services the policy services and the compliance services across the workload management system . For example in one implementation partitioning the monolithic Linux distribution within a multiple layer model that includes physical hardware distributions and virtual software distributions may enable each layer of the operating system to be developed delivered and supported at different schedules. In one implementation a scheduling system may coordinate such development delivery and support in a manner that permits dynamic changes to the physical resources in the infrastructure which provide stability and predictability for the infrastructure .

In one implementation partitioning the Linux operating environments into physical hardware distributions and virtual software distributions may further enable the workload management system to run workloads in computing and storage environments that may not necessarily be co located or directly connected to physical storage systems that contain persistent data. For example the workload management system may support various interoperable and standardized protocols that provide communication channels between users applications services and a scalable replicated storage system such as the clustered file system illustrated in wherein such protocols may provide authorized access between various components at any suitable layer within the storage system.

In one implementation the clustered file system may generally include various block storage devices each of which may host various different file systems. In one implementation the workload management system may provide various storage replication and version management services for the clustered file system wherein the various block storage devices in the clustered file system may be organized in a hierarchical stack which may enable the workload management system to separate the clustered file system from operating systems and collaborative workloads. As such the storage replication and version management services may enable applications and storage services to run in cloud computing environments located remotely from client resources .

In one implementation various access protocols may provide communication channels that enable secure physical and logical distributions between subsystem layers in the clustered file system e.g. a Coherent Remote File System protocol a Dynamic Storage Technology protocol which may provide a file system to file system protocol that can place a particular file in one of various different file systems based on various policies or other suitable protocols . Furthermore traditional protocols for access files from a client resource e.g. HTTP NCP AFP NFS etc. may be written to file system specific interfaces defined in the definitive software library . As such the definitive software library may provide mappings between authorization and semantic models associated with the access protocols and similar elements of the clustered file system wherein the mappings may be dynamically modified to handle any new protocols that support cross device replication device snapshots block level duplication data transfer and or services for managing identities policies and compliance.

As such the storage replication and version management services may enable users to create workloads that define identity and policy based storage requirements wherein team members identities may be used to dynamically modify the team members and any access rights defined for the team members e.g. new team members may be added to a write access group users that leave the team may be moved to a read access group or removed from the group policies that enforce higher compliance levels for Sarbanes Oxley may be added in response to an executive user joining the team etc. . For example a user that heads a distributed cross department team developing a new product may define various members for the team and request permission for self defined access levels for the team members e.g. to enable the team members to individually specify a storage amount redundancy level and bandwidth to allocate . The workload management system may then provide fine grained access control for a dynamic local storage cache which may move data stored in the in the clustered file system to a local storage for a client resource that accesses the data i.e. causing the data to appear local despite being persistently managed in the clustered file system remotely from the client resource . As such individual users may then use information technology tools define for local area networks to access and update the data wherein the replication and version management services may further enable the individual users to capture consistent snapshots that include a state of the data across various e mail systems databases file systems cloud storage environments or other storage devices.

In one implementation the storage replication and version management services may further enable active data migration and auditing for migrated data. For example policies or compliance issues may require data to be maintained for a longer lifecycle than hardware and storage systems wherein the workload management system may actively migrate certain data to long term hardware or an immutable vault in the clustered file system to address such policies or compliance issues. Furthermore identity based management for the data stored in the clustered file system may enable the workload management system to control track and otherwise audit ownership and access to the data and the workload management system may further classify and tag the data stored in the clustered file system to manage the data stored therein e.g. the data may be classified and tagged to segregate short term data from long term data maintain frequently used data on faster storage systems provide a content addressed mechanism for efficiently searching potentially large amounts of data etc. . Thus the workload management system may use the storage replication and version management services to generate detailed reports for the data managed in the clustered file system.

In one implementation the storage replication and version management services may further provide replication services at a file level which may enable the workload management system to control a location an identity and a replication technique e.g. block level versus byte level for each file in the clustered file system . In addition the storage replication and version management services may further enable the workload management system to manage storage costs and energy consumption e.g. by controlling a number of copies created for any particular file a storage medium used to store such copies a storage location used to store such copies etc. . Thus integrating federated identities managed in the identity vault with federated policy definition services may enable the workload management system to manage the clustered file system without synchronizing or otherwise copying every identity with separate identity stores associated with different storage subsystems.

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may provide orchestrated virtualization for managing services provided in the information technology infrastructure . In particular virtualization generally ensures that a machine runs at optimal utilization by allowing services to run anywhere regardless of requirements or limitations that underlying platforms or operating systems may have. Thus the workload management system may define standardized partitions that control whether certain portions of the operating system execute over hardware provided in a hosting environment or inside virtual machines that decouple applications and services from the hardware on which the virtual machines have been deployed. The workload management system may further employ a standardized image for the virtual machines provide metadata wrappers for encapsulating the virtual machines and provide various tools for managing the virtual machines e.g. zero residue management agents that can patch and update running instances of virtual machines stored in the clustered file system databases or other repositories .

In one implementation the virtualized services provided in the workload management system may simplify processes for developing and deploying applications which may enable optimal utilization of physical resources in the infrastructure. Furthermore virtualization may be used to certify the Linux operating environments employed in the infrastructure for any suitable platform that include various physical resources . In particular as described in further detail above the workload management system may partition the Linux operating environments into a multiple layer distribution that includes a physical distribution and a virtual distribution wherein the physical distribution may represent a lower level interface to physical resources that host virtual machines while the virtual distribution may represent any applications or services hosted on the virtual machines

For example in one implementation the physical distribution may include a minimally functional kernel that bundles various base drivers and or independent hardware vendor drivers matched to the physical resources that host the virtual machines . In one implementation the physical distribution may further include a pluggable hypervisor that enables multiple operating systems to run concurrently over the hosting physical resources a minimal number of software packages that provide core functionality for the physical distribution and one or more of the zero residue management agents that can manage any virtualized resources that may be hosted on the physical resources . As such in response to any particular request to install a physical distribution package selections available to the workload management system may include packages for the kernel the hypervisor the appropriate drivers and the management agents that may be needed to support brands or classes of the underlying physical resources

Furthermore in one implementation the virtual distribution may include a tuned appliance which may generally encapsulate an operating system and other data that supports a particular application. In addition the virtual distribution may further include a workload profile encapsulating various profiles for certifying the appliance with attestation tokens e.g. profiles for resources applications service level agreements inventories cost compliance etc. . Thus the virtual distribution may be neutral with respect to the physical resources included in the physical distribution wherein the virtual distribution may be managed independently from any physical drivers and applications hosted by a kernel for the virtual distribution e.g. upgrades for the kernels and physical device drivers used in the physical distributions may be managed independently from security patches or other management for the kernels and applications used in the virtual distributions . Thus partitioning the physical distributions from the virtual distributions may remove requirements for particular physical resources and preserve records for data that may require a specific application running on a specific operating system.

In one implementation from a business perspective the workload management system may secure the virtualized resources in a similar manner as applications deployed on the physical resources . For example the workload management system may employ any access controls packet filtering or other techniques used to secure the physical resources to enforce containment and otherwise secure the virtualized resources wherein the virtualized resources may preserve benefits provided by running a single application on a single physical server while further enabling consolidation and fluid allocation of the physical resources . Furthermore the workload management system may include various information technology tools that can be used to determine whether new physical resources may be needed to support new services deploy new virtual machines and establish new virtual teams that include various collaborating entities.

In one implementation the information technology tools may include a trending tool that indicate maximum and minimum utilizations for the physical resources which may indicate when new physical resources may be needed. For example changes to virtual teams different types of content changes in visibility or other trends for the virtualized resources may cause changes in the infrastructure such as compliance storage and fault tolerance obligations wherein the workload management system may detect such changes and automatically react to intelligently manage that the resources in the infrastructure . In one implementation the information technology tools may further include a compliance tool providing a compliance envelope for applications running or services provided within any suitable virtual machine . More particularly the compliance envelope may save a current state of the virtual machine at any suitable time and then push an updated version of the current state to the infrastructure whereby the workload management system may determine whether the current state of the virtual machine complies with any policies that may have been defined for the virtual machine . For example the workload management system may support deploying virtual machines in demilitarized zones cloud computing environments or other data centers that may be remote from the infrastructure wherein the compliance envelope may provide a security wrapping to safely move such virtual machines and ensure that only entities with approved identities can access the virtual machines

Thus from an architectural perspective the virtualized resources may enable the workload management system to manage development and deployment for services and applications provisioned in the infrastructure . For example rather than dynamically provisioning physical resources to deal with transient peaks in load and availability on a per service basis which may result in under utilized physical resources the workload management system may host multiple virtual machines on one physical machine to optimize utilization levels for the physical resources which may dynamically provisioned physical resources that enable mobility for services hosted in the virtual machines . Thus in one implementation mobile services may enable the workload management system to implement live migration for services that planned maintenance events may impact without adversely affecting an availability of such services while the workload management system may implement clustering or other availability strategies to address unplanned events such as hardware or software failures.

In one implementation the workload management system may further provide various containers to manage the virtual machines wherein the containers may include a security container an application container a service level agreement container or other suitable containers. The security container may generally provide hardware enforced isolation and protection boundaries for various virtual machines hosted on a physical resource and the hypervisor hosting the virtual machines . In one implementation the hardware enforced isolation and protection boundaries may be coupled with a closed management domain to provide a secure model for deploying the virtual machines e.g. one or more security labels can be assigned to any particular virtual machine to contain viruses or other vulnerabilities within the particular virtual machine . Furthermore in the context of tuned appliances wherein one virtual machine hosts one service that supports one particular application the application container may package the service within a particular virtual machine image . As such the virtual machine image may include a kernel and a runtime environment optimally configured and tuned for the hosted service. Similarly the service level agreement container may dynamically monitor meter and allocate resources to provide quality of service guarantees on a per virtual machine basis in a manner transparent to the virtual machine kernel

In one implementation the various containers used to manage the virtual machines may further provide predictable and custom runtime environments for virtual machines . In particular the workload management system may embed prioritization schemes within portions of an operating system stack associated with a virtual machine that may adversely impact throughput in the operating system. For example unbounded priority inversion may arise in response to a low priority task holding a kernel lock and thereby blocking a high priority task resulting in an unbounded latency for the high priority task. As such in one implementation the prioritization schemes may embed a deadline processor scheduler in the hypervisor of the virtual machine and build admission control mechanisms into the operating system stack which may enable the workload management system to distribute loads across different virtual machine and support predictable computing. In addition the workload management system may decompose kernels and operating systems for virtual machines to provide custom runtime environments. For example in the context of a typical virtual machine an unprivileged guest virtual machine may hand off processing to a helper virtual machine at a device driver level. Thus to support server class applications that may depend on having a portable runtime environment the workload management system may use the decomposed kernels and operating systems to dynamically implement an operating system for a particular virtual machine at runtime e.g. the dynamically implemented operating system may represent a portable runtime that can provide a kernel for a virtual machine that hosts a service running a server class application which may be customized as a runtime environment specific to that service and application .

In one implementation the workload management system may further employ different virtualization technologies in different operating environments. For example in one implementation the workload management system may implement Type 1 hypervisors for virtualized server resources and Type 2 hypervisors for virtualized workstation desktop or other client resources . In particular Type 1 hypervisors generally control and virtualize underlying physical resources to enable hosting guest operating systems over the physical resources e.g. providing coarse level scheduling to partition the physical resources in a manner that can meet quality of service requirements for each of the guest operating systems hosted on the physical resources . Thus the workload management system may implement Type 1 hypervisors for virtualized server resources to leverage performance and fault isolation features that such hypervisors provide. In contrast Type 2 hypervisors generally include use a host operating system as the hypervisor which use Linux schedulers to allocate resources to guest operating systems hosted on the hypervisor. In Type 2 hypervisor architectures such as the VMware GSX Server Microsoft Virtual PC and Linux KVM hosted virtual machines appear as a process similar to any other hosted process. Thus because workstations desktops and other client resources may include hardware that may or may not support virtualization the workload management system may provide centralized desktop management and provisioning using Type 2 hypervisors. For example the workload management system may manage and maintain desktop environments as virtual appliances hosted in the infrastructure and then remotely deliver the desktop environments to remote client resources e.g. in response to authenticating an end user at a particular client resource the virtual appliance carrying the appropriate desktop environment may be delivered for hosting to the client resource and the client resource may transfer persistent states for the desktop environment to the infrastructure to ensure that the client resource remains stateless .

In one implementation orchestrated virtualization may generally refer to implementing automated policy based controls for virtualized services. For example an orchestrated data center may ensure compliance with quality of service agreements for particular groups of users applications or activities that occur in the information technology infrastructure . The workload management system may therefore provide a policy based orchestration service to manage virtualized resources wherein the orchestration service may gather correct workload metrics without compromising performance in cloud computing environments or other emerging service delivery models. For example workloads that users define may be executed using coordinated sets of virtual machines embedding different application specific operating systems wherein the workload management system may provision and de provision the virtual machines to meet requirements defined in the workload e.g. using standard image formats and metadata wrappers to encapsulate the workloads embed standard hypervisors in the virtual machines physical to virtual P2V or virtual to virtual V2V conversion tools to translate between different image formats etc. . Furthermore in cloud computing environments that can include unpredictable sets of dynamic resources external to the infrastructure the workload management system coordinate such resources using a closed loop management infrastructure that manages declarative policies fine grained access controls and orchestrated management and monitoring tools.

In one implementation the workload management system may further manage the orchestrated data center to manage any suitable resources involved in the virtualized workloads which may span multiple operating systems applications and services deployed on various physical resources and or virtualized resources e.g. a physical server and or a virtualized server . Thus the workload management system may balance resources in the information technology infrastructure which may align management of resources in the orchestrated data center with business needs or other constraints defined in the virtualized workloads e.g. deploying or tuning the resources to reduce costs eliminate risks etc. . For example as described in further detail above the configuration management database may generally describe every resource in the infrastructure relationships among the resources and changes incidents problems known errors and or known solutions for managing the resources in the infrastructure .

As such the policy based orchestration service may provide federated information indexing every asset or other resource in the infrastructure wherein the workload management system may reference the federated information to automatically implement policy controlled best practices e.g. as defined in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library to manage changes to the infrastructure and the orchestrated data center. For example the configuration management database may model dependencies capacities bandwidth constraints interconnections and other information for the resources in the infrastructure which may enable the workload management system to perform impact analysis what if analysis and other management functions in a policy controlled manner. Furthermore as noted above the configuration management database may include a federated model of the infrastructure wherein the information stored therein may originate from various different sources. Thus through the federated model the configuration management database may appear as one virtual database incorporating information from various sources without introducing overhead otherwise associated with creating one centralized database that potentially includes large amounts of duplicative data.

In one implementation the orchestration service may automate workloads across various physical resources and or virtualized resources using policies that match the workloads to suitable resources . For example deploying an orchestrated virtual machine for a requested workload may include identifying a suitable host virtual machine that satisfies any constraints defined for the workload e.g. matching tasks to perform in the workload to resources that can perform such tasks . In response to identifying allocating and deploying the suitable host virtual machine deploying the orchestrated virtual machine for the workload may include the workload management system positioning an operating system image on the host virtual machine defining and running the orchestrated virtual machine on the chosen host virtual machine and then monitoring restarting or moving the virtual machine as needed to continually satisfy the workload constraints.

In one implementation the orchestration service may include various orchestration sub services that collectively enable management over orchestrated workloads. For example the orchestration service may be driven by a blueprint sub service that defines related resources provisioned for an orchestrated workload which the workload management system may manage as a whole service including various different types of resources . Furthermore a change management sub service may enable audited negotiation for service change requests including the manner and timing for committing the change requests e.g. within an approval workload . The sub services may further include an availability management sub service that can control and restart services in a policy controlled manner a performance management sub service that enforces runtime service level agreements and policies a patch management sub service that automatically patches and updates resources in response to static or dynamic constraints and a capacity management sub service that can increase or reduce capacities for resources in response to current workloads.

To provide exemplary contexts for some of the orchestration sub services noted above the availability management sub service may automatically migrate a virtual machine to another physical host in response to a service restart failing on a current physical host more than a policy defined threshold number of times. With respect to the performance management sub service in response to determining that a service running at eighty percent utilization can be cloned the service may be cloned to create a new instance of the service and the new instance of the service may be started automatically. Furthermore to manage a patch for running instances of a service the patch management sub service may test the patch against a test instance of the service and subsequently apply the patch to the running service instance in response to the test passing. Regarding the capacity management sub service an exemplary service instance may include a service level agreement requiring a certain amount of available storage for the service instance wherein the capacity management sub service may allocate additional storage capacity to the service instance in response to determining that the storage capacity currently available to the service instance has fallen below a policy defined threshold e.g. twenty percent .

In one implementation the orchestration service may incorporate workflow concepts to manage approval workloads or other management workloads wherein a workload database may store information that the workload management system can use to manage the workloads. For example in one implementation an approval workload may include a request to provision a particular service to a particular user in accordance with particular constraints wherein the approval workload may include a sequence of activities that includes a suitable management entity reviewing the constraints defined for the service determining whether any applicable policies permit or prohibit provisioning the service for the user and deploying the service in response to determining that the service can be provisioned among other things. Thus the workload engine may execute the orchestration service to map the sequence of activities defined for any particular workload to passive management operations and active dynamic orchestration operations. For example the workload database may stores various declarative service blueprints that provide master plans and patterns for automatically generating service instances physical distribution images and virtual distribution images that can be shared across the workload management system to automatically generate the service instances and declarative response files that define packages and configuration settings to automatically apply to the service instances.

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may enable collaboration between entities that interact with the services provided in the information technology infrastructure . In particular collaboration may generally involve dynamic teams that cross traditional security and policy boundaries. For example where loosely affiliated organizations share data and applications the workload management system may enable continued collaboration even when some of the participants sharing the data and applications may be temporarily offline e.g. the workload management system may authorize certain users to allocate portions of local client resources to support cross organizational endeavors . Thus the workload management system may provide a standard interface designed to enable dynamic collaboration for end users that simplify interaction with complex systems which may provide organizations with opportunities for more productive and agile workloads.

In one implementation the workload management system may provide a collaboration service that enables workloads to span multiple users applications services systems or other resources . For example multiple users may collaborate and share data and other resources throughout the workload management system both individually and within virtual teams e.g. via a service bus that transports data relating to services or other resources over the event bus . As such the workload management system may support virtual team creation that can span organizational and geographic boundaries wherein affiliations content status and effectiveness may be represented for identities that have membership in any particular virtual team e.g. to enable online and offline interaction between team members . In one implementation the workload management system may provide enriched collaboration content e.g. images video text data feeds and may efficiently transport the collaboration content between team members e.g. via the service bus . Furthermore the workload management system may integrate desktops laptops personal digital assistants smart phones or other suitable client resources into virtual team collaboration experiences in order to meet emerging demands for mobile interoperable and integrated access. Thus the collaboration enabled in the workload management system may operate in an adaptive collaborative environment which may unify technologies for online integrated media sharing with offline authoring and editing.

In one implementation the collaboration service may generally include a web based platform that support inter organization and intra organization management for virtual teams interoperability between various different collaboration products social networking to deliver information that enables the virtual teams to interact efficiently either online or offline and federated searches against any suitable information source among other things. For example in one implementation the collaboration service may include various collaboration sub services that collectively enable the adaptive collaborative environment including a client sub service an aggregation sub service an information sub service a real time collaboration sub service and a metadata sub service.

In one implementation the client sub service may provide communication interfaces with real time online systems offline systems and user interfaces. In particular functionality for the client sub service may be provided in a web based interface that supports interaction with the real time online systems in addition to software that can execute locally at client resources to provide offline access to shared data and real time meetings that may involve shared applications and shared desktops. For example in one implementation the client sub service may communicate with the aggregation sub service to coordinate the communication and collaboration across various information sources wherein the aggregation sub service may route messages to the appropriate information sources in appropriate formats. Furthermore to ensure that collaborative contexts reference information that may be distributed across the infrastructure rather than hosted within one particular application the information sub service may integrate the different information sources within the collaborative environment. As such the virtual teams may connect and collaborate using information that originates anywhere across the infrastructure and the information sub service may enable members of the virtual teams to discuss information or other content from the various sources in an interactive manner. The real time collaboration sub service may interact with the information sub service to provide real time meetings that include audio content video content instant message content and other forms of communication content in real time collaborative contexts within the infrastructure and with third parties.

In one implementation the metadata sub service may provide a helper service to the aggregation and information sub services collecting ancillary metadata generated during interaction between virtual team members and create collaborative threads to maintain contexts that generated the data. Furthermore the metadata sub service may evaluate the ancillary metadata to discover new and relevant links between information sources and integrate data that can potentially originate from various disparate information sources. For example the metadata sub service may provide a uniform format for classifying data collected during collaborative contexts which may provide a single source for virtual team members to search and display the data across any suitable collaboration source. Similarly the metadata sub service may index and unify data collected from disparate network sources including various search engines and content aggregation services to help the virtual team members to locate information that may be interesting or otherwise relevant to the collaborative contexts. As such the various sub services integrated within the collaboration service may provide a collaborative environment that supports dynamic interaction across organizational boundaries and different information sources in a manner that can account for any particular virtual team member s personal preferences.

In one implementation as noted above the technologies integrated by the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B may collectively provide various services that the workload management system can use to manage workloads and enable intelligent choices in an information technology infrastructure . Furthermore various horizontal integration components may be distributed in the workload management system to integrate the various technologies employed in the model driven architecture A and the service oriented architecture B and provide an agile and interoperable information technology infrastructure .

In particular the horizontal integration components distributed across the workload management system may provide agility and interoperability to the information technology infrastructure through support for various emerging service delivery models including Web 2.0 Software as a Service SaaS mashups hardware software and virtual appliances cloud computing grid computing and thin clients among others. For example in one implementation every service application or other resource in the workload management system may be provided with an application programming interface that can provide connectivity between different operating systems programming languages graphical user interface toolkits or other suitable services applications or resources .

In one implementation the application programming interface may include a Representational State Transfer REST application program interface which may use standard methods defined in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP wherein using standardized types to format data may ensure interoperability. In one implementation the REST interface may define a Uniform Resource Identifier URI that represents a unique identity for any suitable entity and may further define relationships between the represented identities with hyperlinks that can be selected to access information for related identities attribute claims roles policies workloads collaboration spaces and workflow processes. Thus through the use of URIs hyperlinks and other standard HTTP methods the REST interface may provide an interface to a data ecosystem that can be navigated in a web based environment that can be used anywhere in the workload management system. In one implementation the REST interface may declare a namespace having version controls and standard methods to read and write to the data ecosystem and may include a URI registry containing the URIs that represent the identities in the data ecosystem. Thus any suitable resource may programmatically discover other identities that communicate using the REST interface e.g. the REST interface may be implemented in a communication gateway to physical resources a communication gateway to virtualized resources a communication gateway to configuration resources etc. .

Furthermore in one implementation the workload management system may extend an application program interface stack for the supplied REST interface which may enable new services applications and other resources to be integrated into the workload management system in a manner that automatically inherits the identity based and policy controlled services implemented in the workload management system. In particular the supplied application program interface stack may generally include a unified adapter and a proxy to existing and future technologies using protocols to enable services that communicate through the REST interface regardless of whether the services reside in the infrastructure a cloud computing environment a third party data center or elsewhere e.g. web service protocols lightweight directory protocols messaging queue protocols remote procedure call protocols etc. . To provide support to developers and users that extend the application program interface stack supplied for the REST interface a Recipe based Development Kit RDK may provide full source code examples for various operating systems programming languages and graphical user interface toolkits.

Additionally in one implementation the workload engine may manage creation of application program interface keys for the REST interface stack whereby auditing and policy based approvals may be supported for provisioning the application program interface keys. For example the workload management system may deploy widgets to client desktops wherein the widget may track identities and contexts that include attempts to access the REST interface stack. Thus in response to provisioning or auditing application program interface keys platform authentication and policy checks may be triggered against the accessing identity and the context that the keys supply. In a similar manner the application program interface keys may enable the workload management system to meter costs for the information technology infrastructure .

Thus the standardized stack supplied for the REST application program interface may provide support for industry standard authentication and authorization methods which may enable identity managed and policy controlled auditing for events and access controls. Furthermore the extensibility of the REST application program interface may enable integration with any suitable existing or future developed system. For example in one implementation the REST interface may be configured with standards such as the Atom Syndication Format and Atom Publishing Protocol to integrate feed synchronization JavaScript Object Notation and Extensible Markup Language XML to integrate enterprise portals mashups and social networking platforms. Thus in the context of feed synchronization to provide automatically notifications in response to any changes to a particular resource a user may simply enter a URI for the resource in an existing web browser feed aggregator e.g. Firefox bookmarks . Thus by providing extensible support for any suitable system application service or other resources the features of the REST application program interface may provide agility and interoperability to the infrastructure .

Having described the model driven and service oriented architecture A B that collectively provide the agile responsive reliable and interoperable environment that enables the features of the workload management system the description to be provided below will address certain particular features of the workload management system. In addition further detail relating to the architectural foundation and other features of the workload management system may be provided in Novell Architectural Foundation A Technical Vision for Computing and Collaborating with Agility Automation for the New Data Center and A Blueprint for Better Management from the Desktop to the Data Center the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

According to one aspect of the invention illustrates an exemplary method for intelligent workload management. In particular the intelligent workload management method may be used to manage approval workloads created in response to service requests. In particular an operation may include creating an approval workload in response to a receiving a request for a service from any suitable user application system or other entity having an identity in the workload management system. For example in one implementation the request may generally specify any components needed to configure the service for a particular task e.g. a raw machine hosting an operating system and storage may be requested to deploy a particular application in the raw machine an existing service may be requested to specify any suitable combination of components that can deploy the application etc. . In addition the request may further specify desired a performance level or service level for the service e.g. availability release capacity financial constraints continuity etc. any comments for provisioning the service in a certain manner e.g. provision the service as soon as possible according to a particular schedule or policy to particular members in a virtual team with a particular configuration etc. .

Thus in one implementation the request may generally include any suitable criteria that the requesting entity specifies to define constraints for deploying the requested service wherein the workload management system may create the approval workload in operation to determine whether or not the requested service can be provisioned in a manner that meets the constraints defined in the request. For example in one implementation the approval workload may generally define a task that includes various human and or automated approvers or service delivery managers collaboratively managing the service request to determine whether the service can be provisioned as requested. Thus to manage the approval workload an operation may include the workload management system querying a configuration management database to obtain an infrastructure model describing any computing resources and storage resources available to run the requested service.

In one implementation the model of the computing resources obtained in operation may include various rack mounted servers and or blade servers which may include multi core processors e.g. sixty four bit processors a multiple gigabyte local memory a serial attached Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID Ethernet and Storage Area Network SAN interfaces and embedded hardware that can support virtualization. In addition the computing resources may further run an appropriate operating system for the underlying physical architecture including a virtual machine monitor e.g. a hypervisor various device drivers a management kernel and any suitable management agents. In one implementation the management kernel and the management agents may collectively provide support for remotely deploying virtual machines to be executed by the hypervisors present on the computing resources which may enable the workload management system to group and organize the computing resources. For example a globally unique identifier e.g. a URI may be created for each of the computing resources whereby the computing resources may be grouped or otherwise organized according to any suitable combination of a type e.g. thin blade symmetric multiprocessing etc. intended purpose e.g. test production etc. owner physical location or other classifying types. Furthermore the workload management system may configure one or more of the computing resources to function in isolation or cooperatively with other computing resources to create high availability clusters.

In one implementation the model of the storage resources obtained in operation may include various SAN disk block storage arrays and or file servers whereby the storage resources may be collectively pooled and protected with identity based policy controls. In one implementation the computing resources described above may access the storage resources on behalf of virtual machines deployed in the infrastructure wherein the storage resources may be individually managed during lifecycles of the virtual machines in a dynamic manner. Furthermore the workload management system may group and organize the storage resources in a similar manner as the computing resources wherein the workload management system may manage the storage resources according to any suitable combination of a type e.g. available RAID 5 disks intended purpose e.g. temporary protected remotely replicated etc. owner physical location or other classifying types.

In one implementation the model of the computing resources and the storage resources obtained in operation may further include various relationships between the resources wherein the relationships may include dependencies capacities and bandwidth requirements. For example any particular virtual machine deployed in the infrastructure may generally run on physical computing resources wherein the model may include federated information that links a network address identities and other information for the virtual machine with any computing resources and storage resources that have been allocated to the virtual machine which may enable lifecycle management for the virtual machine. Thus the configuration management database may generally provide federated knowledge detailing any suitable entity managed in the workload management system and relationships between such managed entities.

In one implementation in response to querying the configuration management database in operation to obtain the current model of the infrastructure an operation may determine whether the workload management system can provision the service requested in the approval workload in a manner that meets any constraints that the request defined for the service. In particular the workload management system may determine whether the infrastructure model indicates that the infrastructure has available computing resources and storage resources suitable to provision the requested service. Furthermore the workload management system may employ the identity management and policy enforcement services to determine whether the service can be provisioned to the requesting entity without violating any relevant policies. For example to authenticate and configure a desktop machine for a chief financial officer a biometric authorization component e.g. a fingerprint reader may be installed in the desktop machine. Thus the identity management and policy enforcement services may collectively prohibit the workload management system from deploying services to the desktop machine that would add a keystroke logger remove the biometric authorization component or violate another policy with respect to the chief financial officer identity. In another example requests for Bit Torrent storage may be denied regardless of an identity for the requesting identity because a policy prohibits peer to peer file sharing.

Thus in response to the workload management system determining in operation that the requested service cannot be provisioned in accordance with the constraints defined in the request e.g. because the infrastructure lacks sufficient computing resources and or storage resources to support the service the requested service violates a relevant policy with respect to an identity for the requesting entity etc. the workload management system may deny the request and send an appropriate denial notification to the requesting entity in an operation . For example the denial notification may provide a reason for denying the service request which may provide information that can be referenced to analyze subsequent requests having similar criteria modify the request based on available resources or relevant policies audit approval processes in a compliance review or otherwise referenced.

On the other hand in response to determining in operation that the requested service can be provisioned in accordance with the requested constraints e.g. because the infrastructure has sufficient computing resources and storage resources to support the service the requested service does not violate any policies with respect to the identity for the requesting entity etc. the workload management system may approve the request and then initiate provisioning for the service in an operation . In particular in response to approving the request the workload management system may reserve appropriate physical computing resources virtual computing resources and or storage resources to run the service wherein operation may include determining whether such resources can be automatically and or immediately allocated. For example certain workloads may be prioritized to ensure that business objectives can be met wherein the workload management system may defer the approval workload in operation in response to determining that allocating the resources to the approval workload may occupy resources needed for higher priority workloads e.g. because the reserved resources are currently subject to a blackout period for patching or updating the resources .

As such in response to determining that the resources reserved to the service cannot be provisioned automatically and or immediately the workload management system may manage creation of a provisioning plan for the service in an operation . In particular operation may include various automated and or human entities interacting to create the provisioning plan wherein the provisioning plan may include pre empting the approval workload until workloads in a high priority queue have completed moving the approval workload to the high priority queue dynamically allocating additional resources to the approval workload e.g. pre empting lower priority workloads or otherwise balancing utilization of the resources in the infrastructure between business processes and system processes that may have different priorities. Furthermore in one implementation the workload management system may coordinate the interaction between the entities that create the provisioning plan in operation e.g. because the service cannot be provisioned until a certain process has completed a certain entity provides feedback etc. . As such operation may generally include various processes and interactions between entities which the workload management system may manage to create the plan for suitably provisioning the approved service.

In one implementation in response to determining that the resources reserved to the service can be provisioned automatically and immediately or alternatively in response to successfully creating the provisioning plan for the service in operation the workload management system may provision the requested service in an operation . In particular operation may include allocating an operating system image a resource inventory and software to an orchestrated virtual machine that can run the service and embedding lifecycle control information within the orchestrated virtual machine to enable management for the virtual machine and the computing resources allocated to the service. In one implementation one or more of the computing resources in the infrastructure may be configured as an image creation server wherein the image creation servers may be dedicated to creating and installing virtual machines in various ways. For example in a large information technology infrastructure that frequently creates virtual machine instances multiple image creation servers may be employed to create and install the virtual machines or one or more of the image creation servers may be configured to create in place virtual machines wherein such virtual machines may be incubated on particular computing resources that further execute the virtual machines.

Thus in one implementation operation may include invoking an image creation service which may create a virtual machine image to run the requested service. For example the image creation service may contact an image repository that contains various ready to run virtual machine images and then appropriately download one or more of the virtual machine images that can run the requested service. The image creation service may then clone and configure the virtual machine image downloaded from the image repository based on any constraints that the request defines for the service. As such operation may generally include creating a new virtual machine having an operating system image external storage references and control information particularly configured for the requested service e.g. based on identities policies service level agreements lifecycle management etc. and may further include deploying the newly created virtual machine to computing resources that have been reserved to run the requested service. Alternatively or additionally the image creation service may provide a push model for deploying the virtual machine image wherein the image creation service may instruct the image repository to multi cast the image to multiple computing resources. Thus the push model implementation may pre stage the multi casted virtual machine image for deployment over various potential deployment targets.

In one implementation in response to successfully provisioning the service in operation the workload management system may update the infrastructure model in an operation . For example any resources identities policies or other information associated with the provisioned service may be indexed within a global namespace in the federated configuration management database. As such the workload management system may reference the updated infrastructure model to track registered virtual machines that have been provisioned and deployed in the infrastructure hierarchical relationships between the registered virtual machines and the resources identities policies or other information associated with the virtual machines and otherwise provide lifecycle management for the virtual machines as will be described in greater detail below. Furthermore an operation may include the workload management system sending a service provisioning notification to the requesting entity wherein the notification sent in operation may indicate that the service has been successfully provisioned provide information that can be referenced to analyze subsequent requests having similar criteria audit approval processes in a compliance review or otherwise provide information relevant to the provisioned service.

In one implementation the workload management system may manage the provisioned service in an operation in response to successfully provisioning the service in operation . In particular as noted above updating the infrastructure model in operation may provide information that the workload management system can reference to provide lifecycle management for services provisioned and deployed in the infrastructure. For example various lifecycle rules and control information may be used to respond to variable computing demands changes and unexpected events in the infrastructure wherein services that run within virtual machines may introspectively monitor and report on health of the hosted services. Thus the provisioned service may be managed in operation with the lifecycle control information embedded in the host virtual machines e.g. monitoring real time execution states and other health conditions automatically managing identities and policies in response to monitored health conditions retiring resources reserved or allocated the virtual machine that may no longer be needed etc. .

In addition the workload management system may cooperate with the lifecycle controls embedded in the host virtual machines to manage the provisioned service. In particular the workload management system may aggregate information relating to the monitored states reported from individual virtual machine instances and record such information within a context describing a current state of the infrastructure model. Thus physical constraints dependencies current performance trends and other real time execution states may be monitored to schedule virtual machines that run provisioned services to computing resources for execution in a manner that satisfies any identity constraints policy controls service level agreements or other constraints that have been defined for the services. For example operation may include applying policy defined thresholds to any status events generated by the monitored computing resources storage resources virtual machines or other resources e.g. responding to a monitored variable that exceeds or falls below a policy defined threshold for more than a policy defined time period . In another example operation may further include managing version controls for virtual machine images which may provide support for inserting management agents that can tune or patch the virtual machine images as needed and rolling the virtual machine images back to a pristine state among other things.

Thus the techniques described above the intelligent workload management method may generally provide lifecycle management from creating a virtual machine image that can host a requested service through eventual retirement of the virtual machine image. Moreover in addition to introspective health monitoring and maintenance for individual virtual machine images the lifecycle management techniques may provide federated information for managing an entire information technology infrastructure which may be used to assure compliance with legal and contractual obligations for any suitable hardware or software that an organization may use create detailed plans for implementing or rolling back proposed changes to the infrastructure detect resolve and otherwise remediate incidents in the infrastructure reactively and proactively manage problems in the infrastructure with known workarounds fixes and permanent infrastructure changes and ensure that every service in the infrastructure meets or exceeds service level requirements among other things.

According to one aspect of the invention illustrates an exemplary system for discovering enriched information technology models in the intelligent workload management system. In one implementation the information technology models may be enriched with workload entitlements derived from single sign on workload identities which may be generated from authentication tokens that define various credentials or permissions assigned to any suitable user application system service resource or other entity having an identity managed in the workload management system. In particular as described in further detail above in connection with and the workload management system may generally provide various services that integrate information technologies for identity management policy enforcement compliance assurance managing physical computing and storage resources orchestrating virtual machines that run on the physical computing resources and reference the physical storage resources enabling collaborative virtual teams and providing architectural agility among other things. The workload management system may therefore include a management infrastructure having a workload engine that can dynamically allocate physical resources to host virtual machines that run applications and services supporting infrastructure workloads which may enable a distributed and virtualized data center that enables mobility for any suitable client device .

As such to manage mobility for client devices or other resources in the distributed and virtualized data center the workload engine may use at least the integrated identity management technologies to securely name associate authenticate and authorize identities that may consume applications and services in the workload management system. More particularly in one implementation managed identities may be stored in a federated identity vault that provides a context to bind information technology processes managed by the workload engine e.g. from a service request that a particular entity provides to data that the request targets in the physical storage resources . For example the identity vault may contain various managed identities that grant users rights or permissions to applications services or other resources and the identity vault may further contain various managed identities that grant the applications services or other resources rights or permissions to other applications services or resources. Moreover the managed identities stored in the identity vault may define various different roles for the represented entities whereby the identity vault may define federated rights permissions or other credentials granted to represented entities across various authentication domains. Thus the system B may employ various identity data abstractions maintained in the federated identity vault to generate workload entitlements that can enrich discovery in the workload management system e.g. single sign on authentication tokens generated by an authentication server .

For example the management infrastructure may further include a discovery engine that can identify and describe an operational state for any resource in an actual model of the information technology infrastructure. In one implementation the discovery engine may any suitable agent based technique or agent less technique to discover physical devices in the actual infrastructure model such as an Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP ping a Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP Get or Transmission Control Protocol TCP port probing among others. As such the discovery engine may discover various types of information to identify and describe the physical devices in the actual infrastructure model . For example the information discovered for the physical devices may include processor types reboot capabilities virtualization capabilities hardware components out of band management capabilities power supply ratings or other information. Additionally the discovery engine may further discover various types of information to identify and describe applications running in the actual infrastructure model . For example in one implementation the discovery engine may use application fingerprinting to discover the applications running in the actual infrastructure model wherein the application fingerprinting may include matching artifacts or other information discovered for the physical devices with predetermined application attributes that identify and describe the applications e.g. file locations registry settings service signatures etc. .

Furthermore in one implementation the discovery engine may discover workload entitlements or various other dependencies between the applications physical devices and other resources in the infrastructure to discover the applications and services running in the actual infrastructure model . In particular applications may generally include one or more aggregated services while services may generally include one or more aggregated resources whereby the dependencies discovered in the actual infrastructure model may identify and describe any applications configured to interact with services actively running in the actual infrastructure model . In particular in one implementation the services running in the actual infrastructure model may be hosted by various virtual machines that run on the physical devices discovered in the infrastructure. Thus the dependencies discovered by the discovery engine may include relationships between identities that define workload entitlements for the virtual machines the physical devices that host the virtual machines any applications that the virtual machines execute any users that interact with the virtual machines or the applications that the virtual machines execute or any other suitable entity having an identity managed in the workload management system. For example the relationships may include network addresses storage locations capacity and bandwidth requirements lifecycle control information or other information associated with the unique identities that define the workload entitlements for the virtual machines which may define dependencies between the identities for the virtual machines and the identities for the applications physical devices users or other entities discovered in the actual infrastructure model

As such in one implementation the actual infrastructure model discovered by the discovery engine may include discovered physical devices applications services and other resources managed identities for the discovered physical devices applications services and other resources and relationships or other dependencies between the discovered physical devices applications services and other resources. In one implementation a snapshot of the actual infrastructure model may then be persistently stored in a federated configuration management database that provides version controls and other features for managing the infrastructure model . For example the configuration management database may further contain a planned version of the infrastructure model that includes planned changes to the infrastructure whereby the management infrastructure can monitor the actual infrastructure model and compare the actual infrastructure model to the planned infrastructure model to determine whether the planned changes have been properly implemented. In addition the configuration management database may further contain previous versions of the infrastructure model whereby the management infrastructure can manage remediation workloads to restore previous versions of the infrastructure model in response to problems or other incidents in the actual infrastructure model . Thus the configuration management database may maintain various versions of the infrastructure model to provide federated knowledge for managing actual operational states configuration states prior states or other states for the infrastructure.

In one implementation the federated infrastructure knowledge maintained in the configuration management database may be further integrated with a help desk system that can provide known errors and solutions problem histories workarounds and temporary fixes that can be referenced to resolve minor incidents without having to contact human personnel at the help desk system . For example in response to experiencing an incident or other problem with the client device or another resource in the infrastructure a user may submit a trouble ticket detailing the incident to the help desk system which may attempt to automatically identify any information in the configuration management database that can be used to resolve the incident e.g. matching the incident to a similar error in the problem histories and returning a known solution workaround or temporary fix that previously resolved the similar error . In another example in response to the discovering a particular service running on a particular port enriching such discovery with workload entitlements may be used to determine whether a user running the service has the appropriate entitlements to run the service on the particular port. Thus the help desk system may provide various automated remediation procedures that can discover problems in the infrastructure which may be reported to the workload engine to fix or otherwise remediate the problems in a remediation workload.

For example in one implementation the workload engine may reference a workload database in response to receiving a reported problem from the help desk system wherein the workload engine may retrieve a previous remediation workload that can be employed to remediate the problem or the workload engine may add a new remediation workload to the workload database and manage the remediation workload to remediate the problem. In particular the remediation workloads that the workload engine manages may include any suitable combination of automated and human intervention wherein the workload engine may coordinate interaction between various automated systems and human entities to remediate the problem as appropriate. For example remediating an issue such as disaster failover may include automatically migrating services to recovery resources whereas diagnosing troubleshooting or remediating a problematic application may primarily include interaction between human personnel while other problems may include suitable combinations of automatic intervention and human intervention. In this context the managed identities may bind remediation workloads to certain entities such that the workload database may detail information relating to identities involved in the problems and any resolution to the problems.

In one implementation the federated infrastructure knowledge maintained in the configuration management database may further provide the management infrastructure with information for managing planned changes to the infrastructure. In particular the federated infrastructure knowledge may detail managed identities service components and dependencies in the infrastructure which may be referenced to determine best practices for implementing the planned changes. For example in one implementation discovered information stored in the configuration management database may be used to prepare an organization for a Payment Card Industry PCI compliance review wherein the discovery engine may discover data detailing every resource and managed identity that interacts with PCI credit card information and export the data to a suitable database for further analysis. In another example the discovered information may be used to prepare a service for deployment to a cloud computing environment in which case application fingerprinting may be executed for the service to discover every dependency for the service construct a cloud packaging scenario for the service and send a notification to any managed identities that may be impacted by deploying the service to the cloud computing environment. In yet another example the discovered information may be used to reduce costs for maintaining an application wherein fingerprinting for the application may be executed to discover every instance of the application managed identities that use the application instances and create an elimination or consolidation plan based on comparative values utilizations and costs for maintaining the application instances e.g. if twenty thousand users interact with one instance of the application at a cost of 1 000 000 while two users interact with a second instance of the application at a cost of 500 000 the second instance may be recommended for elimination or consolidation with the first instance .

According to one aspect of the invention illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method for managing changes in the information technology models in the intelligent workload management system wherein the information technology models may be discovered using techniques illustrated in and described in further detail above. In particular the method may generally manage the changes in the information technology models using information stored in a configuration management database which may include one or more federated databases that collectively contain various configuration items that detail every resource or other asset that may play a role in delivering information technology services in an information technology infrastructure represented by the managed information technology models. Thus as will be described in further detail herein the method may include various operations that can specify control and track the configuration items in the configuration management database including any planned changes or actual changes to the configuration items in a comprehensive and systematic manner.

For example in one implementation an initial operation may generally include capturing a snapshot for a current operational state of the infrastructure wherein a discovery engine may capture the current infrastructure model snapshot in operation . In particular as described in further detail above in connection with the current infrastructure model snapshot captured by the discovery engine may include information that identifies and describes physical devices in the actual infrastructure applications and services running in the actual infrastructure and workload entitlements identities or other dependencies associated with the applications physical devices and other resources in the infrastructure. Thus the current infrastructure model captured in operation may generally include various physical devices applications services and other resources in the infrastructure managed identities for the discovered resources and relationships or other dependencies for the discovered resources e.g. identities for virtual machines that host or otherwise execute the discovered applications and services identities for physical devices that host the virtual machines identities for any users that interact with the virtual machines identities for the applications or services that the virtual machines host or execute workload entitlements associated with the identities etc. .

In one implementation the infrastructure model snapshot captured in operation may then be stored in a configuration management database which may register relationships links or other dependencies that define interconnections and independencies between any configuration items that represent the managed identities for the physical devices applications services and other resources discovered in the infrastructure. Thus as will be described in further detail herein the relationships links or other dependencies captured in operation may enable various policy controlled management processes for version controlled models of the information technology infrastructure including processes for managing changes to the infrastructure analyzing actual or potential impacts of the managed infrastructure changes analyzing what if scenarios for planned or proposed changes to the infrastructure and remediating incidents in the infrastructure among other things. In particular the configuration management database may contain various federated models of the infrastructure each of which may include a version number or a temporal identifier that enables version controlled management of the federated infrastructure models whereby various policies may permit managed entities to suitably manage resources and interaction with the resources in the infrastructure model.

In one implementation to manage changes to the infrastructure the method may generally include an operation that determines whether a change to the infrastructure model has been requested and may further include an operation that determines whether an update to the infrastructure model has been scheduled. For example in response to receiving a request to change the infrastructure model from one or more users or other managed entities operation may determine that one or more changes to the infrastructure model have been requested and initiate an audited negotiation to determine whether the requested changes can be approved and create a plan to commit the requested changes. Furthermore one or more policies may define suitable conditions that result in automated requests to change the infrastructure model e.g. the policies may define certain availability performance disaster or other thresholds that automatically trigger requested changes to the infrastructure in order to meet dynamic demands in resource utilization work schedules energy consumption profitability or other business needs . Furthermore with respect to operation the policies may further define certain intervals for periodically scheduling updates to the infrastructure model e.g. to ensure that the current infrastructure model does not contain stale or otherwise outdated information detect drifts between actual and planned versions of the infrastructure model etc. .

In one implementation in response to operation resulting in a determination that a managed entity or a policy controlled action has requested one or more changes to the infrastructure model the audited negotiation may be initiated in an operation to determine whether or not to approve the requested changes. For example the audited negotiation may define certain policy controlled change requests as pre approved planned changes that can be automatically approved define other policy controlled change requests as unplanned disaster planning changes that require an implementation plan prior to approving such change requests for implementation and define change requests from managed entities as planned changes that require an implementation plan prior to approving such change requests for implementation. For example the policy controlled change requests defined as pre approved planned changes may include a request to migrate a virtual machine that has failed to properly restart more than a threshold number of times on a particular physical host a request to clone a service instance running at a utilization percentage that has fallen below a threshold defined in a service level agreement a request to increase or reduce storage capacity allocated to a service instance based on current infrastructure workloads or other suitable requests. With respect to the unplanned disaster planning changes examples may include a request to activate a failover system in response to detecting faults or conditions that may threaten proper functioning for certain resources in the infrastructure while examples of managed entity change requests may include requests to provision new services modify rights allocated resources or other criteria for existing services or other suitable requests.

As such in one implementation operation may generally include identifying the planned changes to the infrastructure contained in the change requests and then approving the change requests in response to determining that the planned changes do not violate any relevant policies. For example in response to a request to change membership in a virtual team operation may identify the relevant change in the virtual team membership and query the current snapshot of the infrastructure model to identify any related changes to the infrastructure that may be needed to implement the change in the virtual team membership e.g. any changes in content or visibility that may be needed to implement the change in the virtual team membership . In another example in response to a request to provision a new service operation may identify storage allocations client resource allocations middleware resource allocations server resource allocations or other changes to the infrastructure that may be need to properly instantiate the new service. Thus in addition to identifying the particular changes planned in the change request operation may include querying the current snapshot of the infrastructure model to identify any relevant links relationships or dependencies that the particular planned changes may impact wherein the planned changes identified in operation may include a collection of changes to the infrastructure needed to implement the change request.

In one implementation in response to identifying the relevant collection of infrastructure changes needed to implement the change request an operation may include determining whether the identified changes can be approved for implementation. In particular any changes to the infrastructure may be analyzed to ensure that implementing the changes will not adversely impact any obligations for compliance storage fault tolerance or other conditions in the infrastructure wherein operation may include analyzing the planned changes identified in operation in view of various policies to determine whether or not the planned changes can be approved. In addition operation may further include determining whether the planned changes may compete with any resources services applications or other configuration items that the planned changes may impact in the infrastructure model and may further include determining whether the planned changes may compete with any other planned changes to the infrastructure model. For example in one implementation operation may identify a cluster of physical servers to host a new virtual machine that will run a new instantiated service identified in the change request whereby operation may determine whether the new virtual machine can be deployed to the cluster of physical servers without causing outages for any other virtual machines that may be hosted in the server cluster. In another example operation may determine whether a blackout period has been defined to schedule a patch or update to the server cluster wherein deploying the new virtual machine to the server cluster may compete with the blackout period.

In one implementation in response to determining that the planned changes violate one or more policies in operation the audited negotiation may include attempting to resolve the competing changes in operation . In particular the audited negotiation further managed in operation may include any suitable combination of human and or automated intervention to determine whether the planned changes can be approved in response to modifying the planned changes for compliance with violated policies avoiding interference with other resources that may be impacted by the planned changes avoiding interference with other planned changes to the infrastructure or otherwise modifying the planned changes in a manner that can resolve competition between the planned changes and the current snapshot of the infrastructure model. Alternatively operation may result in denying the planned changes in response to determining that the planned changes cannot be modified or otherwise implemented without resolving any relevant competition between the planned changes and the current snapshot of the infrastructure model e.g. throwing an exception in response to determining that the change request includes inconsistencies cannot be resolved with other competing changes etc. .

Thus in response to identifying any modifications to the planned changes that can be made to resolve competition between the planned changes and the current snapshot of the infrastructure model operation may further include constructing a plan to commit the change request. In one implementation the commitment plan may assign relative priorities to different resources identities processes or other information associated with the change request and suitably schedule the planned changes defined in the change request to ensure continued availability and performance of the infrastructure. For example operation may dynamically pre empt or starve the change request until any impacted resources or other change requests having higher priorities have been managed or alternatively the change request may be assigned a higher priority that dynamically pre empts or starves management any lower priority impacted resources or other change requests until the higher priority change request has been managed e.g. a change request from a network administrator may receive a higher priority than a competing change request from an end user whereby the competing change request may be pre empted or starved until the higher priority change request from the network administrator has been resolved . Furthermore in one implementation operation may include approving the competing changes for parallel implementation in response to the competing changes overlapping or otherwise not truly conflicting and may further include managing a collaborative thread to coordinate resolving competition among different entities systems or other resources involved in competing changes.

Thus in one implementation operation may dynamically allocate resources to various change requests to maintain an appropriate balance between business processes systems maintenance resource utilizations or other concerns for managing the infrastructure. In one implementation a change management database may then be updated in an operation to reflect the modified commitment plan created to resolve the competition for the change request. For example operation may update the change management database to move one or more change requests between different priority queues or pre empt certain change requests until relevant preconditions have been satisfied among other things. Alternatively in response to operation previously determining that the planned changes defined in the change request do not compete with other concerns for managing the infrastructure model operation may update the change management database with an appropriate commitment plan for the change request. In either case in response to constructing a commitment plan for the change request and appropriately updating the change management database in operation the planned changes may be implemented in an operation .

For example in one implementation implementing the planned changes in operation may include provisioning application instances service instances or other resources defined in the change request migrating a virtual machine that has failed to start on a current physical host to a new physical host deploying a virtual machine to server cluster in response to completing any patches or updates scheduled during a blackout window reconfiguring virtual machines service instances or other resources defined in the change request or otherwise coordinating a schedule to implement the planned changes in a manner that will not disrupt availability performance storage capacities maintenance or other management concerns in the infrastructure. Furthermore in one implementation the commitment plan created for the planned changes in operation may represent the planned changes within one or more transactions wherein each of the transactions may define a set of changes to the infrastructure. Thus in the context of implementing the transactions that represent the planned changes operation may require every planned change represented in a particular one of the transactions to commit. In particular in response to determining that every planned change represented in the particular transaction has committed operation may commit the particular transaction to complete the implementation of the represented planned changes. By contrast in response to determining that one or more of the planned changes did not properly commit operation may roll back every planned change represented in the transaction whereby operation may ensure that the committed changes to the infrastructure model do not result in an inconsistent state for the infrastructure.

In one implementation an operation may then include capturing an update snapshot of the infrastructure model and storing the updated infrastructure model snapshot in the configuration management database. In particular operation may capture the updated infrastructure model snapshot in response to operation suitably committing any planned changes to the infrastructure and or rolling back any uncommitted planned changes in response to operation determining that an update to the infrastructure model has been scheduled or any suitable combination thereof. Further in one implementation the updated infrastructure model snapshot captured in operation may be stored in the configuration management database with a version number or other identifier that enables subsequent management of the infrastructure model. As such the configuration management database may contain various version controlled snapshots of the infrastructure model that can be used to manage the infrastructure model in various ways. For example the version controlled snapshots may include hypothetical what if models of the infrastructure temporal identifiers for dynamically visualizing time lapsed changes to the model and managed entities involved in proposing planning implementing or otherwise participating in the changes.

Thus the infrastructure model snapshots maintained in the configuration management database may provide version controlled information that can be used to audit previous configuration histories and changes to the infrastructure arbitrate among competition in the infrastructure that may result from planned or requested changes identify potential impacts that may result from subsequent planned or requested changes provide an authoritative source defining permitted configurations or changes to the infrastructure certify proper authorization or approval for any implemented changes to infrastructure detect any unauthorized or unapproved changes to the infrastructure or determine whether an actual state for the infrastructure has drifted from a planned configuration state for the infrastructure. For example according to one aspect of the invention illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method for managing drifts in the information technology models in the intelligent workload management system. In particular various version controlled snapshots of the information technology models may generally be discovered and captured using similar techniques as illustrated in as described in further detail above.

In one implementation the method for managing drifts in the version controlled infrastructure model snapshots may include comparing one or more configuration versions of the infrastructure model which detail planned proposed or what if configuration states for the infrastructure with an actual discovered version of the infrastructure model that details an actual current operational state for the infrastructure. In particular the method illustrated in and described in further detail herein may be used to determine whether the actual operational state for the infrastructure properly implements or otherwise conforms to the planned or proposed configuration state for the infrastructure. As such managing drifts in the version controlled infrastructure model snapshots may include an operation that receives a configuration version of the infrastructure model e.g. from a configuration management database or a change management database while an operation may include discovering the actual operational state for the infrastructure model e.g. by a discovery engine using similar techniques as described above in connection with .

In one implementation an operation may then include comparing the planned configuration version and the actual discovered version of the infrastructure model to determine whether the current operational state for the infrastructure properly conforms to the planned configuration state for the infrastructure model. In particular the planned configuration state and the actual operational state may both include various organizations dependencies uses and other relationships among configuration items managed in the infrastructure wherein the operational state discovered in operation should correspond to the planned configuration state defined in the configuration version of the infrastructure model received in operation . In one implementation in response to operation comparing the planned configuration version and the actual discovered version of the infrastructure model an operation may then include determining whether the actual discovered version of the infrastructure model has drifted from the planned configuration version of the infrastructure model. For example in one implementation operation may include automatically determining whether the actual version of the infrastructure model has drifted from the planned configuration version of the infrastructure model e.g. in an diff comparison that employs the automated orchestration services described above or the drift detection operation may be performed manually e.g. in a visual comparison between the different versions of the infrastructure model .

In one implementation in response to operation resulting in a determination that the actual model conforms to the proposed model the current version of the infrastructure model may then be validated in an operation . In particular validating the current version of the infrastructure model may include updating the configuration management database to associate the current version of the infrastructure model with a suitable identifier that reflects a valid state for the infrastructure model at a particular point in time. As such validated versions of the infrastructure model may be referenced in response to detecting drift between subsequent operational and configuration states for the infrastructure model. For example in response to operation resulting in a determination that the actual model does not conform to the proposed model an operation may include identifying a location of the drift in the infrastructure model. In one implementation locating the drift in the infrastructure model may therefore operate proactively wherein periodically capturing holistic snapshots of the model may provide reference points for identifying when or where the actual model drifted from what the actual model should contain. Thus operation may include analyzing relationships or other dependencies in the configuration version and the actual version of the model which may expose problems that may potentially remain undetected for otherwise properly functioning resources.

In particular operation may locate the drift in response to detecting that changes have been implemented to the infrastructure at an incorrect time detecting that one or more changes have been committed for a change transaction that includes uncommitted changes i.e. that the infrastructure requires rollback or other suitable conditions that may leave the infrastructure model in an inconsistent or otherwise improper state. For example change and configuration management for the infrastructure may be defined in periodic terms e.g. scheduling a particular change for a particular day or time in governance risk and compliance terms e.g. ensuring that the infrastructure always includes a particular configuration required for policy compliance or other suitable terms. Thus in response to determining that the actual operational state of the infrastructure has drifted from a relevant configuration state operation may use the federated information contained in the configuration management database to dynamically identify particular areas within the infrastructure associated with the drift wherein an operation may then reference the identified drift location to recover the infrastructure model.

In particular operation may generally include a management infrastructure referencing one or more events changes or other suitable conditions associated with the drift in the infrastructure model wherein the management infrastructure may create an orchestrated remediation workload to recover the infrastructure model. For example in one implementation the orchestrated remediation workload may be controlled with one or more policies to generate a suitable sequence of instructions that can restore the actual operational state of the infrastructure to another operational state that the infrastructure should be configured with. In particular previously validated versions of the infrastructure may define suitable operational states for the infrastructure wherein the policies that control the orchestrated remediation workload may reference any asynchronous events changes or other conditions that occurred in the infrastructure during a time period between the suitable operational states and the drifted operational states for the infrastructure. Thus operation may generally include managing the orchestrated remediation workload to continually synchronize the drift in the infrastructure model wherein the asynchronous events changes or other conditions may define relevant processes needed to roll the infrastructure model back to the suitable operational state. For example the orchestrated remediation workload may be configured to roll back a particular physical machine to a particular prior state captured in a validated snapshot using time ordered versioned snapshots of the model. In another example the orchestrated remediation workload may implement one or more changes to the infrastructure in order to achieve the configuration state defined in the planned version of the infrastructure model as received in operation .

As such the orchestrated virtualization services provided in the workload management system may generally enable automated recovery of the infrastructure model from a drifted or non conforming state to another suitable or conforming state. In particular the versioned transactional model maintained in the configuration management database may enable point in time recovery for the infrastructure model that automatically changes the state of the infrastructure to a prior or future state that defines a suitable should or ought configuration state for the infrastructure. In other words the version controlled snapshots of the model contained in the configuration management database may be referenced to derive a recipe that include a sequence of instructions for recovering the infrastructure model to prior or planned versions. Moreover the remediation workloads for recovering the infrastructure may be driven with integrated services for managing identities policies and compliance whereby the drifts that can be detected in the infrastructure may encompass conflicts between configuring the infrastructure for features performance and scalability versus configuring the infrastructure for security control and protection.
