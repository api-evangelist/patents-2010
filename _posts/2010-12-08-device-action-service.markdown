title: Device action service
abstract: A user may operate many devices, each of which may provide a set of actions, such as installing firmware or software or viewing the contents of the device. However, in order to perform these actions, the user may have to interact with each device using a different user interface, resulting in an inconsistent user experience. Instead, a device action service may allow a user to identify his or her devices, may identify the actions available for each device (e.g., by interacting with a device source of each device, such as a manufacturer); and upon the request of the user, may present a list of the user's devices and the actions available for each device. The actions may comprise hyperlinks to various portions of the website of the device source (e.g., a driver page and a service registration page), or controls invoking the requested action upon the device.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a set of devices operated by a user such as a mobile phone a portable game device and a portable media player. Each device may comprise a particular set of capabilities e.g. a display of a particular size and quality one or more input devices a data store of a particular size communication components such as a network adapter a cellular communication device or a global positioning service GPS receiver and an operating environment comprising a set of applications media objects and user data objects . Each device may operate in isolation or may interoperate with one or more other devices and data sources accessible over a network such as the internet.

With respect to these devices a user may wish to perform various actions. As a first example the user may wish to access the data store of a device e.g. in order to view the data objects stored therein or to upload or download new data objects to or from the device. As a second example the user may wish to install a new hardware driver or software application on the device. As a third example the user may wish to establish or perform an interoperation of the device with another device e.g. establishing or performing a synchronization option to synchronize the data object in the data store of the device with equivalent data objects stored in the data tore of another device.

In order to perform these actions the user often utilizes an administrative interface of the device. As a first example in order to install a new software package or hardware driver on a workstation computer the user may using the workstation computer visit a website of a distributor of the software package or hardware driver download an installer package and execute the installer package on the workstation. As a second example the user may configure a first device using a second device e.g. in order to upload one or more media objects to a portable media player the user may download the media objects to a workstation computer connect the portable media player to the workstation computer and send the media objects from the workstation computer to the portable media player. As a third example the user may subscribe a particular device to a service that the device may access through a communication device. For example a user may subscribe to a chat service accessible over the internet and may register a mobile phone device with the chat service in order to engage in chat sessions of the chat service with other users through the mobile phone e.g. by installing a software chat client on the mobile phone . In this manner the user may perform various actions upon the devices operated by the user.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A user of a set of devices that may be individually operated and administrated may encounter several disadvantages. As a first example in order to identify his or her devices and exploring the device state of each device the user may have to interact individually with each device. As a second example in order to perform actions upon the devices the user may have to operate each device in isolation e.g. operating a first device to download and install thereupon a hardware driver or software application and operating a second device to download and install thereupon the same or a different hardware driver or software application and or utilize loosely coupled interoperation of the devices e.g. downloading the hardware driver or software application to a first device for delivery to and installation upon a second device . The isolation and or loose interoperation of the devices may hamper the application of actions such as the administration of the devices in order to synchronize data by necessitating the use of different interfaces on different devices. For example although several devices operated by the user may feature a similar set of actions e.g. view contents play media object and install hardware driver the user interface of the first device through which these actions are performed may be very different from the user interface on a second device for performing the same actions and a third device may have to utilize another device in order to perform the same actions e.g. in order to copy a media object to a portable media player the user may have to download the media object to a workstation computer and then synchronize the media library of the workstation computer with the portable media player . The use of a plurality of divergent user interfaces to perform a standard set of actions on several devices may present an inconsistent and frustrating user experience for the user.

Presented herein are techniques for facilitating and improving the consistency of the performance of actions on a set of devices operated by a user. In accordance with these techniques a device action service may be created to identify for respective devices e.g. for particular models of mobile phones portable game devices and portable media players a set of actions that may be performed on the devices. For example the device action service may by communicating with a manufacturer of a particular model of mobile phone determine that the mobile phone supports a set of actions comprising activate mobile service install hardware driver and view address book. The manufacturer may also provide instructions for performing these actions e.g. the activation of mobile service may be performed by visiting an activation web page of the website of the manufacturer a hardware driver may be installed by downloading and executing a software package stored at a particular location of the website of the manufacturer and the contents of the address book may be viewed by sending a particular signal to the mobile phone. Additional actions may be identified for other devices and these actions may be stored in association with the devices in a data store. The device action service may then permit each user to identify the set of devices that the user operates and may store the set of devices. The user may then request a presentation of the set of devices operated by the user. The device action service may present a list of the user s devices including for each device a set of actions that may be performed on the device. The user may select the actions from the list in order to perform the corresponding actions on the device.

As compared with the conventional operation of the devices the use of a device action service configured in this manner may present several advantages to the user. As a first example instead of the user having to operate each device separately the device action service may represent a centralized location where the user may identify and explore each of the devices operated by the user. As a second example by providing access to the set of actions for each device in a unified user interface e.g. a single web page listing the set of actions available for each device in a standardized manner irrespective of the types of devices and or actions involved the device action service may present a more consistent and comprehensive user interface for the administration of the devices than may be presented by different user interfaces of different devices. As a third example the device action service may be accessed on any device operated by the user thereby presenting a consistent and comprehensive portal to the user s set of devices regardless of which device the user operates to access the device action service.

Additional variations of these techniques may present still further advantages in the implementation of a device action service. As a first example the device action service may be extensible such that respective manufacturers may register new device types with the device action service and may provide updated sets of actions that may be performed thereupon. As a second example for an unidentified device e.g. a device for which the manufacturer cannot be determined or has not specified a set of actions for the device the device action service may present to the user a set of generic actions that may be performed on the device. As a third example the device action service may integrate the presentation of devices with services to which the user subscribes and may permit the user to register devices with services. As a fourth example the device action service may present to the user advertisements for products or services that may be available for the devices and in particular may present products and services based on a device state of a device e.g. your device is running low on storage space would you like to subscribe to a cloud storage service in order to offload some data These and other advantages may be achieved through the design of the device action service to identify and offer actions available for devices operated by a set of users.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios may involve a user operating a set of devices. In particular recent developments in mobile computing have yielded a wide range of portable devices including notebook computers of various form factors personal data assistants PDAs media players such as MP3 players and digital versatile disc DVD players portable document readers a wide range of mobile phones and other communication devices digital cameras and game devices. Additionally the user may operate a series of non portable devices such as workstation computers printers home theater systems media center devices video recording equipment network attached storage NAS devices home security and or automation systems and other networked appliances. Each device may be provided by a device source such as a manufacturer a retail distributor an e commerce site or an administrator of an employer organization or academic institution to which the user belongs. Each device may also be of a particular device type e.g. a particular device model that is offered by a manufacturer and or a device category e.g. a class of devices having a similar set of capabilities such as media player device category comprising devices that are capable of storing and rendering various forms of media and a mobile phone device category comprising network connected devices that are capable of initiating or receiving a voice communication session between two or more users of such devices .

The capabilities of each device may be presented to the user as one or more actions that are available for the device and in order to operate the respective devices the user may interact with the devices to request to perform one or more actions thereupon. For example the user may interact with a mobile phone to request access to the set of contacts or to initiate or receive a call or simple messaging service SMS message with a game device to install or play a particular game and with a media player to view the media library stored on the device or to play a particular media object. The devices of a device category may also support a similar set of actions associated with standard device capabilities of the device category e.g. any device within the device category of media players is likely able to support the view media library and play media object actions. Some actions may apply to a large set of devices of different device categories. For example many devices featuring a data store may support a view contents of data store action and many devices featuring an operating environment generated by a firmware stored on a flash memory device may support an install firmware operation. In order to perform a particular action on a particular device the user may operate a user interface of the device. For example a device of a particular device type may include a display component such as a liquid crystal display LCD and a set of hardware controls such as buttons or a touch sensitive display and may present a user interface that allows the user to view available actions and select a desired action. In some such scenarios the user may have to operate a first device in order to perform a desired action on a second device e.g. in order to install firmware a hardware driver or a software package on a portable device having limited or no network connectivity the user may have to download the firmware hardware driver and or software package onto a network connected device such as a workstation computer and then synchronize the latter device with the portable device in order to deliver the installable component.

The exemplary scenario of is frequently performed by users of a set of devices both mobile and stationary in part because such devices often operate in an isolated or loosely coupled manner. However the incomplete or lack of coupling among the devices may result in some disadvantages. As a first example in order to administrate a particular device the user often has to perform the actions on the actual device or a device associated with it such as a workstation computer configured to synchronize data with a portable media player and cannot use any other device . If the user does not have physical access to the device e.g. if the device is located in a different area then the user may be unable to configure the device . As a second example the user may have to operate the user interface of the device in order to perform actions thereupon however the user interface of a particular device may be substantially or complete different from the user interfaces of other device operated by the user . For example a first device may provide access to a set of actions in a first user interface having particular characteristics e.g. a text based menu presented on an LCD and using buttons on the device to navigate the menu a second device may provide access to a set of actions using a second user interface having particular characteristics e.g. a graphical display having a touch based interface to select graphical options and a third device may provide access to a set of options using a third user interface having particular characteristics e.g. a networked device that may be accessed from a web browser to present web pages including selectable actions . The widely divergent types of user interfaces presented by these devices may significantly interfere with the efforts of the user to administrate the devices . This interference may be particularly frustrating to the user e.g. where the devices are similar e.g. widely divergent user interfaces among devices in the same device category and therefore having similar sets of capabilities and or where similar actions are to be applied to the devices e.g. efforts to identify the amount of available storage space on each device may involve completely different interactions with the user interfaces thereof .

Some efforts have been made to alleviate these disadvantages. As a first example some recent developments seek to federate the set of devices into a tightly coupled mesh where devices are aware of the other devices operated by the user and may implicitly share and synchronize data with other devices to provide a consistent user experience within a distributed computing environment regardless of which device the user operates to access the computing environment. As a second example a control panel or synchronization suite of a computer may permit the user to administrate a variety of components associated with the computer including various components with which the computer interfaces. However these techniques involve comparatively tight coupling that may be difficult to implement e.g. the user may not have a device capable of serving as a centralized source of administration particularly if the failure of such a device results in a loss of coupling among and impaired operability of the devices . Additionally these techniques may still limit the administrative interoperability of the devices e.g. the user may utilize a control panel of a computer to administrate the devices coupled thereto but may not be able generally to perform actions on a first device using a second device regardless of the relationship between the devices .

Presented herein are techniques for improving the experience of a user seeking to perform one or more actions upon devices . In accordance with these techniques a device action service may be provided that may identify the devices of the user and may present to the user a set of actions that may be performed upon respective devices . For example the device action service may communicate with a wide variety of device sources e.g. various manufacturers of various devices and for respective device types e.g. the device models offered by a manufacturer may identify a set of actions that may be performed thereupon. Such actions may include e.g. references to web pages of the website of the device source where various actions may be performed e.g. a web page providing a firmware update and instructions for applying to the device or a web page where users may activate a device or register it with a service such that when the user selects the action the corresponding web page of the website of the device source is displayed. Such actions may also include e.g. the actual application of the action to the device . For example a device source may provide to the device action service an executable binary or script that may be executed to implement a particular action upon a device . The device action service may also permit a user to register the devices operated by the user and may store the identified devices for future use. When the user requests a presentation of the devices operated by the user the device action service may generate the presentation and send it to the user .

In addition to identifying and describing the devices of the user e.g. the device source device type device category and or device state of the respective devices the presentation may include a set of actions that may be available for each device based on the actions that are available for devices of the device type. The user may be permitted to select an action in relation to a device and the device action service may facilitate the user in performing the action e.g. by presenting the web page of the device source of the device that explains to the user how to perform the action by providing access to resources involved in the action e.g. a download link to a firmware update and or may directly apply the action to the device e.g. executing a script that targets and alters the device to perform the action . In this manner the device action service may improve the centralization and consistency of the performance of the actions upon the devices e.g. by providing a single user interface that in a consistent manner lists the devices and the actions that may be performed thereupon . Additionally the device action service achieves this centralization without involving the tight coupling and heavy configuration that may be involved in designating the devices as a mesh. These and other advantages may be achievable through the provision of a device action service and the use thereof to perform various actions on the devices of the user .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting to a user a set of devices operated by the user such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for presenting to a user a set of devices operated by the user such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be used with a variety of devices including various portable device e.g. notebook computers of various form factors personal data assistants PDAs media players such as MP3 players and digital versatile disc DVD players portable document readers a wide range of mobile phones and other communication devices digital cameras and game devices and non portable devices e.g. workstation computers printers home theater systems media center devices video recording equipment network attached storage NAS devices home security and or automation systems and other networked appliances . As a second example of this first aspect these devices may have been provided by a variety of device sources such as a manufacturer a retail distributor an e commerce site or an administrator of a company organization or academic institution with which the user is affiliated.

As a third example of this first aspect many architectures may be selected for implementing these techniques. In a first such variation the device action service may be implemented on a server or set of servers operating in the cloud such that a user may register a set of devices with the service for presentation as a web page. In this variation the user does not have any ownership or administration of the servers rather the device action service is wholly provided to the user by another organization and the user may interact with the device action service via a web browser. In a second such variation one or more devices of the user may be involved in implementing some or all of these techniques. In this variation one or more servers may be configured to store a representation of the devices of the user but the presentation may be partly or wholly generated by one or more devices of the user . For example a device of the user may interact with the service to retrieve the set of devices operated by the user and the actions available therefor and may prepare and present the presentation of the devices to the user e.g. by generating a web page including visual representations of the devices and the actions . Many such architectures may be suitable for implementations the techniques presented herein.

As a fourth example of this first aspect many types of actions may be identified as available for such devices including a device action set of such actions such as a software installing action e.g. installing firmware or a firmware update a driver for a hardware component a patch for a software component or an application a data synchronizing action e.g. creating reading updating or deleting data stored on a device a service registering action e.g. registering the device with a particular service a device state viewing action e.g. viewing a device state of a device such as the contents of a data store of the device the available capacity of the device or the charge of a battery powering the device and a device source visiting action e.g. an instruction to visit a website associated with the device source of the device . These actions may also involve e.g. presenting instructions to the user for performing the action on the device providing resources to the user involved in the action e.g. providing a firmware update to the user for delivery to the device and or actually performing the action on the device e.g. executing a script that alters the device in a particular manner . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of identifying actions available for devices of a device type e.g. for a particular device model offered by a device manufacturer . As a first example the actions may be provided by a device source of the device such as a manufacturer retail distributor or e commerce site that has provided the device to the user . The actions may also be specified by an administrator of a company organization or academic institution that has provided the device to the user e.g. a hospital may deliver to healthcare practitioners a set of devices that are preloaded with healthcare software such as medical record database clients and may specify a set of actions that may be performed to administrate the devices and or assist the users in understanding or utilizing the devices . Moreover the device action service may extract the actions from information that is generally provided by a device source e.g. by manually or automatically scraping the actions out of a web page of a website of the device source . Alternatively the device action service may form a cooperative interaction with one or more device sources such that the device sources may directly inform the device action service of the actions available for a particular device or the devices of a device type e.g. by providing an extensible markup language XML document that specifically sets forth the set of actions and the manner of performing respective actions . These actions may be delivered in an active manner e.g. the device source may send push notifications to the device action service and or a in a passive manner e.g. the device action service may poll the device source to receive adjustments to the set of actions available for a device . Moreover upon receiving from a device source a new action that may be available for a device the device action service may actively notify users of the device of the new action that is available for the device . Such notification may be provided e.g. as a pop up notification such as an instant message as a less intrusive notification such as an email message and or as a notification sent to the actual device e.g. as a simple message service SMS message sent to a mobile device .

As a second example of this second aspect for some devices it may be not be possible to receive from a device source the actions that are available. For example the device source may be unidentified may have become nonexistent e.g. a device produced by a defunct technology company may be temporarily or permanently offline or may simply not cooperate with the device action service. In such cases the device action service may be requested to register for a user an unidentified device that does not have an association with a device source and to generate a presentation including actions that may be available for the device . Accordingly the device action service may be configured to associate with the unidentified device at least one generic action that may be available for the unidentified device . As a first variation the device action service may provide a set of generic actions that are applicable to all devices such as registering deregistering connecting to disconnecting from and naming or renaming the device associated with the user account of the user . As a second variation the device action service may query the device to identify various properties e.g. does the device provide a response if queried as a webserver and may associate with the unidentified device various actions corresponding to the properties of the device e.g. query this device as a webserver . As a third variation the unidentified device may be identifiable as belonging to a particular device category e.g. a storage device a media capturing device or a media rendering device. The device action service may therefore identify one or more actions that are often available for devices within the device category and may associate such actions with the device .

As a third example of this second aspect instead of generally identifying actions that may be available for all devices of a device type provided by a device source an embodiment of these techniques may specifically identify the actions available for a particular device . As a first variation a device of a user may have a particular device identifier such as a distinctive code that identifies the device to the device source e.g. a serial number . The device action service may therefore identify the actions available for the device by communicating directly with the device source e.g. by sending the device identifier of the device to the device source and requesting the actions that are available for the device . This variation may be advantageous e.g. because the device source may have more particular information about the device state of the device and or the actions that are available therefor e.g. the actions that the user and or device are authorized to perform upon the device . As a second variation the user may be associated with a service such as a chat service a media sharing service or a communications provision service. The device action service may identify the actions available for a device of the user by requesting from the service the actions available for the device e.g. the chat functions media sharing functions and or connectivity that the service may authorize for and may be capable of extending to the device and upon receiving from the service the actions available for the device associating the actions with the device in the data store . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of identifying the actions available for a particular device including for all devices of a device type and or device category while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of allowing a user to register a device for association with the user account of the user . As a first example the user may simply specify the devices that are operated by the user e.g. by filling out a form of the device action service that identifies and or describes the device . As a second example of this third aspect the devices may be automatically detected and reported to the device action service. In a first variation the user may utilize a particular presentation device to interact with the device action service e.g. a computer having a web browser that the user uses to visit a website of the device action service and the presentation device may be configured to detect the devices of the user and report such devices to the device action service. In a second variation the presentation device may identify itself to the device action service and may automatically be registered by the device action service as a device of the user . As a third example of this third aspect the registration request to register a device with a user account of a user may be received from the device source providing the device to the user e.g. by the manufacturer upon receiving a warranty registration of the device completed by the user by a retail distributor or e commerce site upon selling the device to the user or by an administrator of company organization or institution affiliated with the user upon provisioning the device for the user . As a fourth example of this third aspect a particular device may be shared among a plurality of users e.g. a device shared by several members of a family and the device action service may associate the device with the respective user accounts of the two or more users of the device . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of detecting and registering devices on behalf of users while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the presentation to a user of the devices and actions available therefor. As a first example the presentation may present actions for respective devices as a device source reference provided by a device source e.g. a uniform resource identifier URI of a web page of the website of the device source that informs the user of how to perform a particular action which may be presented in the presentation as a hyperlink to the web page . Alternatively the presentation may include a user control that the user may activate to generate an action request to perform the action upon the device . For example upon receiving the action request the device action service may invoke an executable binary or script that communicates with the device to perform the action .

As a second example of this fourth aspect the presentation may include additional information relating to the devices . As a first variation the presentation may include information about a device state of one or more devices such as a set of applications installed on a device or the versions thereof an amount of storage capacity of a device that has been consumed or that is available or an available charge of a battery powering a device . This information may be relayed to the device action service and inserted into the presentation . For example the device action service may be configured to receive a device state regarding respective devices and store the device state in the data store associated with the device and while generating the presentation retrieve the device state from the data store and present the device state as part of the presentation . Alternatively this information may be inserted into the presentation after delivery to the user e.g. by supplementing the presentation with information about the device states of devices detected by the presentation device of the user . Additionally the actions presented with for a device may relate to a current device state of the device e.g. offering a storage cleanup option for a device having low storage capacity .

As a second variation the presentation may include in the list of devices one or more services with which the user subscribes as well as various actions that may be available for such services. For example the presentation may include a portable hard disk drive and a set of storage actions related thereto e.g. formatting or erasing the hard disk drive viewing the contents of the hard disk drive or synchronizing the hard disk drive with another data source and may also include a cloud storage service and a similar set of actions related thereto. This example may represent the service as a virtual device on par with the physical devices operated by the user and with a consistent presentation of actions for both classes of devices .

As a third variation the presentation may include one or more advertisements for products or services that may be relevant to the devices such as a headset for a mobile phone device or a new game that may be available for a game device . The advertisements may also relate to the device state of a device e.g. an advertisement for a sale of supplemental memory for a device having a device state indicating low available memory .
