title: Pre-pressurization pump liner for vane pump
abstract: A vane liner for use in a vane pump has a vane liner body defining an inner bore for providing a cam surface in a vane pump. The cam surface has a suction opening formed through the body at one circumferential extent, and a discharge opening through the body at a distinct circumferential extent. A pre-pressurization opening extends through the body at a location upstream of an upstream end of the discharge opening, but spaced by at least 90 degrees from a downstream end of the suction opening. A vane pump incorporating the above-discussed liner is also claimed. Further, a vane pump is also disclosed and claimed having the spacing from the downstream end of the suction opening at least X degrees wherein X equals 360 divided by N, N being the number of vanes in the vane pump.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 02 C 3002 awarded by the United States Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

This application relates to a liner for a vane pump wherein a pre pressurization opening is positioned to eliminate cross flow between suction and discharge pressure chambers.

Vane pumps are known and typically include a rotor rotating within a liner. A cam surface within the liner is positioned eccentrically relative to a rotational axis of the rotor. Vanes extend radially inwardly and outwardly of the rotor and in contact with the cam surface. Movement of the vanes along the cam surface causes the vanes to move inwardly and outwardly and move a pump fluid from a suction or inlet to an outlet through pump chambers defined between the vanes.

Thus when the pump chamber communicates with the discharge window opening an immediate increase in pressure creates rapid decrease in air volume.

Pre pressurization has been utilized in the past to provide a step change in the overall volume reduction and pressure increase. Pre pressurization occurs by introducing pressurized fluid into inter vane chambers prior to the chambers communicating with the full discharge window opening. With this there is a step down to an intermediate volume and increase in pressure.

In the existing art this pre pressurization opening communicates with a pump chamber prior to an upstream vane making contact with the cam surface downstream of a suction opening. In this way the pre pressurization discharge fluid communicates back toward the suction pressure chamber.

A vane liner for use in a vane pump has a vane liner body defining an inner bore for providing a cam surface in a vane pump. The cam surface has a suction opening formed through the body at one circumferential extent and a discharge opening through the body at a distinct circumferential extent. A pre pressurization opening extends through the body at a location upstream of an upstream end of the discharge opening but spaced by at least 90 degrees from a downstream end of the suction opening. A vane pump incorporating the above discussed liner is also claimed. Further a vane pump is also disclosed and claimed having the spacing from the downstream end of the suction opening at least X degrees wherein X equals 360 divided by N N being the number of vanes in the vane pump.

These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings the following of which is a brief description.

As shown at a portion of the discharge pressure fluid can communicate into a pre pressurization opening and hence into the pump chamber. The pre pressurization opening can communicate with the discharge pressure fluid downstream of the opening in any number of ways. The opening may communicate with a plenum or may be provided with a dedicated conduit for delivering the fluid.

As shown in the vanes are spaced by 90 degrees. The area in the prior art extends over approximately 95 degrees. The opening extends over approximately 13 degrees. The discharge opening extends over approximately 60 degrees.

As can be appreciated from the vane at approximately 135 degrees has yet to pass the downstream end of the suction opening . At this moment the vane at approximately 225 degrees has already moved past the beginning of the pre pressurization opening . Thus there is cross flow or communication between the opening and the suction opening . This can result in reduced pumping efficiency.

The size of the pre pressurization hole in the prior art has been approximately 1 2 percent of a displacement with the hole area measured in square inches and displacement in cubic inches. The displacement is calculated as set forth below Displacement 

In the prior art the R 0.625 inch 1.588 cm the r 0.425 inch 1.080 cm there were four vanes and the vanes were 0.093 inch 0.236 cm thick. The length L was 1.267 inches 3.218 cm . Thus utilizing this formula the diameter dof 0.142 inch 0.361 cm results in a hole area which will be 1 2 percent of the element displacement.

As can be seen from the vanes are still spaced by 90 degrees. The suction opening is approximately 5 degrees smaller than in the prior art. Thus it extends over only 90 degrees. The pre pressurization opening extends over only 9 degrees and is again smaller than the pre pressurization opening .

The discharge opening extends from approximately 255 degrees to approximately 315 degrees and is thus similar to the prior art.

As can be appreciated from the vane at 135 degrees will be sealed on the downstream end of the suction opening before the vane at approximately 225 degrees begins opening the pre pressurization opening . Thus the pre pressurization opening will not result in cross flow and the reduced volumetric efficiency of the prior art will be eliminated.

The pre pressurization opening is thus shown to be at least 90 degrees from a downstream end of the suction opening and also upstream from an upstream end of the discharge opening. Further generally a vane pump has spacing from the downstream end of the suction opening of at least X degrees wherein X equals 360 divided by N N being the number of vanes in the vane pump. Of course in the disclosed embodiment N is 4 and X is 90.

As shown in the pre pressurization hole extends circumferentially for a distance d. In one embodiment the distance dis 0.099 inch 0.251 cm . This would be in a liner having a radius Rto the 180 degrees position of 0.625 inch 1.588 cm . This Rwould be the major ID cam radius.

While angular positions are disclosed in it should be understood that any one of these locations can be changed. Further for purposes of interpreting the claims in this application the term approximately relative to an angular location should be taken as being plus or minus 2 degrees from the listed angular extent.

The quantities for R r N d are all the same as the prior art. However the L was 0.787 inch 1.999 cm .

Thus the dof 0.099 is calculated. Here the ratio of Rto dis thus 6.31. This ratio is preferably between 4.0 to 8.0.

As shown in in another embodiment there is a pair of pre pressurization openings . Again in combination the area of the openings can be determined by the prior formula.

In a method according to this application a liner such as shown in or is placed within a pump housing in a lubrication system. The pump housing has an inner bore slightly larger than an outer diameter of the liner. A rotor carrying vanes is positioned within the bore of the liner. The notch in the liner of or A is utilized to accept an anti rotation pin partially seated within a similar notch feature within the pump housing. A portion of the pump housing extends into the notch and provides anti rotation. In addition the notch in the liner may be configured to ensure that the liner is placed within the housing in a proper orientation.

The inventive pump is utilized to move oil. Oil is particularly susceptible to detrimental effects from the inclusion of air and thus benefits from the present invention. It should be understood that the invention can be utilized for any fluid that has propensity to have inclusion of air.

Although an embodiment of this invention has been disclosed a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention.
