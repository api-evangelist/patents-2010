This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 234 775 filed Aug. 18 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Interest in and concern about the social performance of companies is growing as people become increasingly aware of the effect company activities have on society. For example those who care about the environment are starting to demand that companies limit their carbon emission reduce their consumption of water and raw materials and avoid emitting harmful chemicals and pollutants. Similarly large groups of consumers and a number of social organizations foundations and government agencies study and care about corporate behavior on issues such as diversity in the workplace and the board room human rights community responsibility business ethics and transparency product quality and safety and involvement in countries that have restrictive or undemocratic regimes.

As a result of this growing awareness of the importance of social performance and sustainable behavior thousands of businesses and social organizations incorporate social responsibility and sustainability considerations into their decisions. Hundred of thousands of branding marketing supply chain and corporate strategy managers in large companies need to benchmark their company s performance manage the impact of environmental employee community and governance issues on their brand and manage their interaction with customer employee investor and activist stakeholders. The managers and staff of 1.3 million US foundations and nonprofits must select corporate targets for donations endorsements and social action. Bloggers journalists and eco driven consumers actively seek information on and support companies that fit their personal social values.

Previously no adequate mechanism has been provided for measuring and monitoring the social performance of companies.

In some embodiments this data may then be reviewed by one or more administrators and or moderators. This data can then be presented to other users.

In some embodiments the server may expose one or more application programming interfaces APIs to one or more Web sites publications and or other information distributors not shown that allow them to automatically incorporate scores generated and or presented as described herein into their published content.

The server and or database can also be coupled to any one or more suitable data sources e.g. directly or via the communication network used to provide data used to calculate scores. In some embodiments data sources can be selected so that they contain data that is published and updated periodically cover at least twenty or any other suitable number of companies for which scores are calculated provide data that can be mapped to a suitable hierarchy as further described below and or meet any other suitable requirement s . For example data sources can include Web sites rating agencies governmental agencies not for profits individual users and or any other suitable data source s .

Each of the user devices server database and or data sources can be any of a general purpose device such as a computer or a special purpose device such as a client a server etc. Any of these general or special purpose devices can include any suitable components such as a processor which can be a microprocessor digital signal processor a controller etc. memory communication interfaces display controllers input devices etc.

In some embodiments the operations shown in and can be performed in the user device the server the database and or one or more other devices. For example in some embodiments a hierarchy as illustrated in can be created in the database. As another example the hierarchy can be created in the server and transferred to the database. As yet another example the data can be mapped in the server. As still another example the data can be mapped in a user device.

In some embodiments the user interactions shown in and can be controlled by the server the user devices and or one or more other devices. For example the user interactions can be controlled through a Web page controlled by the server. As another example the user interactions can be controlled through a dedicated application running on the user devices.

Turning to and example of a process for processing data elements in accordance with some embodiments is illustrated. As shown after process begins at a data element is received from a data source e.g. data source of at . Next at the data element can be mapped to one some or no subcategory and or special issues. An administrator can specify 1 to which subcategory or special issues a data element is to be mapped to based on the type of data element 2 what overall importance weight will be given to a data element within a subcategory and or special issues 3 how much of the value of the data element will be given to a particular subcategory or special issues etc. For example a data element X might be given an importance that is 1.5 times that of the average data element and of its value 25 might be mapped to subcategory A 10 might be mapped to subcategory B and the remaining 65 might be mapped to special topic R.

In some embodiments the data elements from each data source can then be converted from their native rating system into a uniform scoring system e.g. a 0 to 100 scoring system at . The manner of performing this conversion can be different for each data item as data items from the same source may have different rating systems. The conversions can include but are not limited to 

Following the mapping and conversion at and the data element can be saved into a table in database at . For each data element for example the following can be saved a unique name for the data element a code that indicates the name of the data source the date the data element was gathered the name or other identifier of the company to which the data element applies the original value for that particular data element the converted value in the uniform scoring system for that particular data element if applicable the subcategory or special issue the data element is to be mapped to the overall importance weight to be given to the data element within a subcategory and or special issue the value of the data element that is to be given to a particular subcategory or special issue and or any other suitable data. Each time a data source updates its data element s one or more new records can be added to the data element table with the correct new date.

Using the new data element record scores for each subcategory and special issue for each company can be calculated or re calculated at . For example the score S for a company C in subcategory SC can be represented as where 

In some embodiments the values from data element records can be filtered when calculating scores at so that only those that are valid for a particular date are considered. For example when calculating a subcategory score for today for a company the most current data can be used and out of date data can be ignored. On the other hand as another example when calculating a subcategory score for some point in the past old data corresponding to that point in the past can be used and newer data can be ignored.

In some embodiments special issue scores can be compared to a threshold to make sure that the special issue should be applied to a company. For example a company may be determined to be properly associated with an special issue e.g. involved in Burma if it has a score for that special issue of more than 70 or any other suitable number AND if at least two sources indicate that the special issue should apply to the company e.g. it is involved in Burma . If a special issue has been determined to be properly associated with a company the score for that company in the special issue can be set to 100 or any other suitable value .

In some embodiments the scores for data sources can next be analyzed and processed to remove bias in the scores at . For example in some embodiments the following process can be used to de bias scores for data sources First the total score by category by company for all data sources and the score by category by company for each data source can be calculated. Next for each category the distribution of scores across all of the companies for each data source and the distribution of total scores across all of the companies for all data sources can be determined. The parameters of the best fit beta function curve for each of these distributions can then be determined. For each category a conversion table that converts the scores for the companies for each data source into scores that fit the best fit beta function curve for the companies across all data sources is determined and applied. For example for a specific category a data source that is biased positively might have a midpoint of 70 for scores of all companies. If the total score for that category across all data sources has a midpoint at 48 for scores of all companies the midpoint score of 70 from the individual data source may be transformed into a new de biased score of 48 and all other scores for that data source similarly skewed. Next the scores for each subcategory for each company can be re calculated as described above using the de biased scores. A suitable distribution curve for the calculated scores can then be selected. In some embodiments this curve can be selected so that it spreads out scores evenly over a range from 0 to 100 with some scores at both ends and not too many in the middle. This curve selection can be made automatically or manually based on the underlying data and other rating systems. The scores can then be mapped to the chosen curve. For example if the midpoint of all scores for a given subcategory is 50 and the midpoint of the chosen distribution is 48 the score of 50 can be mapped to 48. If the 20percentile of a subcategory distribution of scores is at 38 and the 20percentile of the chosen distribution is at 23 a score of 38 can be mapped to 23. Finally the scores for each subcategory for each company can be re calculated as described above using the mapped scores.

Finally the scores can be saved to database in at and process can loop back to to receive the next data element.

While a set of process steps in a particular order is illustrated in process of some of these steps can be omitted when desired additional steps can be added and the ordering of steps can be changed. For example conversion step can be omitted when suitable. As another example some of the saving of data performed in can be performed before conversion step is performed.

Similarly while process illustrates a single data element being received and operated on the steps performed in process could operate on multiple data elements at each step of the process simultaneously.

Referring back to as mentioned in connection with windows and a user may be able to indicate the relative importance of the categories and or of the subcategories in the total score of a company in some embodiments. For example as illustrated in window of in some embodiments a user can indicate weights to be applied to the scores of individual categories e.g. for categories and as shown in calculating a total score for a company. In such an example when calculating a total score Sfor a company when using weights with values of 1 to 5 as illustrated in for community involvement CO employee EM environmental behavior EN and governance GO categories the total score can be calculated as 

In some embodiments a user can additionally or alternatively indicate how special issues are to impact the total score for a company. For example as illustrated in window of a user can specify that certain special issues are to decrease a company s score by some amount e.g. which can be predetermined based on a user s profile which can be fixed for all users etc. as shown for factors and that certain special issues are to increase a company s score by some amount e.g. which can be predetermined based on a user s profile which can be fixed for all users etc. as shown for factor that certain special issues are to exclude a company from lists advertisements etc. as shown by factor and that certain special issues are to have no impact as shown by factors and .

In some embodiments these user settings for weights and or special issues can be saved in a profile for the user. In some embodiments these user settings for weights and or special issues can be saved in a profile for a group of users. Groups of users can be given the ability to adjust their group profiles allow users to join their group eject users from their group and manage additional information for their group.

As mentioned above in connection with window of in some embodiments a user can select to switch a profile being used to calculate and present company social performance data. A profile can include values for weights indications of how special issues should be treated layouts for search lists and or any other user configurable and or customizable settings. Switching profiles can be performed by selecting the name of a new user profile e.g. which may be the name of another user that has elected to share his or her profile the name of a group profile the name of a system defined profile etc. from a drop down menu such as that in window of . In some embodiments a user may search for a profile setting created by another user or group of users e.g. using interface of that is similar or dissimilar to the one that the user is currently using based on a name of the profile based on similar profile settings and or based on any other suitable criteria or criterion. When the user finds a profile setting that is interesting the user may inspect the profile setting and then use it if desired.

In some embodiments one or more advertisements presented in connection with the presentation of a Web page can be selected based on the advertisements being only from companies having one or more scores that meet a given threshold which can be user and or system specified having only qualifying special issues e.g. not having any special issues that indicate to exclude the company and or being included in an approved list and or not being included in a denied list. The filtering of advertisements in Web pages can be performed at a server such as a Web page server or an advertisement server working in conjunction with a Web page server or a Web browser client on a client computer. Similarly filtering of advertisements can be performed in connection with other applications such as email clients social networking applications program guides network appliances television channels sources of media radio stations streaming media devices electronic books and or any other suitable platform and or mechanism in which advertisements are presented. Further this technique can be used by advertisers to select candidates to receive advertisements who are more likely to be interested in a particular advertisement and or to select the best advertisement for a target customer based on which advertisements correspond to companies that would score highest with the target customer based on his her profile.

In some embodiments a user can provide feedback on advertisements. This feedback can be used as a data source to score the social performance of companies and or provide special issues. For example in some embodiments a user may be able to indicate that a company being advertised on a Web site should have a special issue applied to it. After a sufficient number of such indications have been received an administrator can use this data to update the special issues for a company. Similarly such indications can also be used to impact company scores in some embodiments which can the result in future blocking of advertisements by the company for the user and or other users. Blocking or unblocking of advertisements will also be influenced by whether or not the blocking or unblocking indication came from another user who is in the same user group as the user who is receiving ads. Within group input can be given more or less weight than general input from other users.

In some embodiments any suitable computer readable media can be used for storing instructions for performing the processes described herein. For example in some embodiments computer readable media can be transitory or non transitory. For example non transitory computer readable media can include media such as magnetic media such as hard disks floppy disks etc. optical media such as compact discs digital video discs Blu ray discs etc. semiconductor media such as flash memory electrically programmable read only memory EPROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM etc. any suitable media that is not fleeting or devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission and or any suitable tangible media. As another example transitory computer readable media can include signals on networks in wires conductors optical fibers circuits any suitable media that is fleeting and devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission and or any suitable intangible media.
