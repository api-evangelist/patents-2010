title: Managing communications using alternative packet addressing
abstract: Techniques are described for managing communications for a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a distinct substrate computer network, including for communications involving computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network that use an alternative addressing scheme to direct network packets and other network communications to intended destination locations by using textual network node monikers instead of numeric IP addresses to represent computing nodes at a layer 3 or “network layer” of a corresponding computer networking stack in use by the computing nodes. The techniques are provided without modifying or configuring the network devices of the substrate computer network, by using configured modules to manage and modify communications from the logical edge of the substrate network.

Many companies and other organizations operate computer networks that interconnect numerous computing systems to support their operations with the computing systems alternatively co located e.g. as part of a private local area network or LAN or instead located in multiple distinct geographical locations e.g. connected via one or more other private or shared intermediate networks . For example data centers housing significant numbers of interconnected co located computing systems have become commonplace such as private data centers that are operated by and on behalf of a single organization as well as public data centers that are operated by entities as businesses. Some public data center operators provide network access power and secure installation facilities for hardware owned by various customers while other public data center operators provide full service facilities that also include hardware resources made available for use by their customers. However as the scale and scope of typical data centers and computer networks has increased the task of provisioning administering and managing the associated physical computing resources has become increasingly complicated.

The advent of virtualization technologies for commodity hardware has provided some benefits with respect to managing large scale computing resources for many customers with diverse needs allowing various computing resources to be efficiently and securely shared between multiple customers. For example virtualization technologies such as those provided by VMWare XEN Linux s KVM Kernel based Virtual Machine or User Mode Linux may allow a single physical computing machine to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with one or more virtual machines hosted by the single physical computing machine with each such virtual machine being a software simulation acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource while also providing application isolation and security among the various virtual machines.

Techniques are described for providing managed computer networks such as for managed computer networks that are each implemented as a virtual computer network overlaid on one or more other computer networks. The managed computer networks may in some embodiments be provided by a configurable network service to users or other entities who are customers e.g. for a fee or otherwise clients of the configurable network service such as to remote clients that access the configurable network service and or the provided managed computer networks from remote locations over one or more intervening networks e.g. over the Internet while in other embodiments a single user or entity may implement its own configurable network service to provide the described techniques for one or more of its own managed computer networks. In at least some embodiments the techniques include managing communications for various computing nodes of a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network including in situations in which computing nodes are configured to use an alternative addressing scheme to direct network packets and other network communications to intended destination locations such as by using textual labels instead of numeric IP addresses Internet Protocol addresses to represent computing nodes at an OSI model Open Systems Interconnection model layer 3 or network layer of a computer networking stack in use by the computing nodes. As one example a configurable network service that is providing a managed computer network for a client may allow the client to designate one or more textual network node moniker labels to represent each of the computing nodes of the managed computer network e.g. instead of IP addresses may provide an alternative computer networking stack for use by the computing nodes of the managed computer network to support the use at the layer 3 network layer of the textual network node monikers for network packets and other network communications and may manage the routing of such network communications between computing nodes based on the textual network node monikers. In at least some embodiments some or all of the described techniques are automatically performed by embodiments of a system manager module and or one or more communication manager modules such as modules that are part of a network accessible configurable network service.

Thus the managing of communications for a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network may in at least some embodiments include managing communications that use textual network node monikers to represent computing nodes of the managed computer network that are connected to the substrate network and or to represent external nodes if any outside of the substrate network that are nonetheless integrated into or otherwise part of the virtual computer network. For example the computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network may in some embodiments each have an associated communication manager module that manages communications to and or from the computing node and the communication manager module associated with a source computing node that is sending a communication to one or more indicated final destinations may in at least some situations facilitate the sending of that communication. Similarly any external nodes integrated into the managed virtual computer network may in some embodiments each have an associated edge module that interconnects the substrate network and an external connection to the external node and that operates as such a communication manager module to manage communications to and or from the external nodes as they pass between the substrate network and the external connections. For example a communication manager module that receives a communication from an associated computing node may assist in determining a corresponding intermediate or final destination location within the substrate network to which a destination network node moniker used in the communication is mapped e.g. based on a specified network topology of the managed virtual computer network and take actions to encode the communication for the substrate network so that it will be forwarded to the determined destination location as discussed in greater detail below.

By enabling the communication manager modules of the configurable network service to track and use various information for particular network node monikers in use by various clients various useful capabilities may be provided for a particular managed computer network provided for a client. For example by mapping a particular network node moniker for a particular client to a particular location in the substrate network and by enabling that mapping information to be dynamically updated and rapidly propagated to affected communication manager modules the functionality being provided for in conjunction with a particular network node moniker may be easily moved from one computing node within the managed computer network to another computing node within the managed computer network while the managed computer network continues to be in use including while communications continue to be routed to that particular network node moniker . In such situations the communication manager modules of the configurable network service may facilitate the dynamic modification of a particular network node moniker by immediately routing new communications intended for that particular network node moniker to the computing node that is newly associated with the particular network node moniker or may manage the change to the newly associated computing node in other manners if so configured e.g. if the prior associated computing node continues to be available at least temporarily route new network traffic to the newly associated computing node while maintaining at least some existing ongoing sessions or communication streams with the prior associated computing node . The configurable network service may further facilitate such dynamic computing node changes for particular associated network node monikers in additional manners in at least some embodiments including by sending one or more messages to a computing node that is being newly designated with a particular network node moniker to alert the computing node of the new designation e.g. to prompt the computing node to use the new network node moniker designation to identify itself when sending communications to accept and manage communications that it receives that are directed to the new network node moniker designation and or to initiate one or more network routing related messages to claim the new network node moniker such as in accordance with Request For Comments 3203 DHCP Reconfigure Extension December 2001 Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This document is also available at the time of filing at toolsietforghtmlrfc3203 where and are replaced by the corresponding characters with those names . and respectively .

In addition to enabling the dynamic modification of the use of particular network node monikers within a managed computer network while the managed computer network is in use the tracking and use of information about particular network node monikers for particular clients by communication manager modules of the configurable network service may provide a variety of other benefits as well. For example in at least some embodiments and situations a particular network node moniker in use by a managed computer network for a client may be configured by the client or by the configurable network service to have associated functionality or handling that differs from other network node monikers in use by the managed computer network with the communication manager modules of the configurable network service performing various operations to support the associated functionality or handling for the particular network node moniker. As one example a particular network node moniker may be configured to be simultaneously associated with multiple computing nodes within a managed computer network and the communication manager modules of the configurable network service may use configuration information for that particular network node moniker to determine one or more of the associated multiple computing nodes to receive particular communications directed to that particular network node moniker e.g. by performing load balancing between the associated multiple computing nodes according to one or more defined criteria by performing anycast functionality to select one of the associated multiple computing nodes for a corresponding communication according to one or more defined criteria by performing broadcast functionality to select all of the associated multiple computing nodes for a corresponding communication etc. .

In some embodiments and situations particular policies may be defined and associated with particular network node monikers in use by a managed computer network for a client e.g. may be defined by the client and or by the configurable network service and the communication manager modules of the configurable network service may perform various operations to implement or otherwise support the associated one or more policies for communications directed to and or from such a particular network node moniker. For example in situations in which multiple computing nodes within a managed computer network are simultaneously associated with a particular network node moniker a defined policy for the particular network node moniker may be used to automatically determine which one or more of the associated multiple computing nodes to receive particular communications directed to that particular network node moniker such as by defining one or more criteria to use in performing one or more of load balancing anycast broadcast multicast etc. More generally a defined policy associated with a particular network node moniker having one or more associated computing nodes may be used to control whether how and or when communications are forwarded to and or from those one or more associated computing nodes by the communication manager modules such as to implement one or more types of functionality from the following non exclusive list firewall functionality intrusion detection functionality intrusion prevention functionality content analysis functionality content modification functionality including encryption decryption wide area network WAN acceleration or other network acceleration functionality virtual private network VPN connection endpoint functionality etc. A defined policy associated with a particular network node moniker may further control or otherwise influence how communications to and or from that particular network node moniker are handled relative to those of other network node monikers by the communication manager modules such as to provide higher or lower priorities e.g. in accordance with a quality of service or QOS specified by the policy for the particular network node moniker for communications to and or from the particular network node moniker or to otherwise modify how communications to and or from the particular network node moniker are handled. In order to facilitate the definition and use of such policies the configurable network service may provide in some embodiments a policy registry that allows particular clients to define and reuse particular policies and that optionally provides default policies from the configurable network service and or clients that may be available for selection and optional modification by other clients. Additional details related to particular operations that may be performed by communication manager modules in at least some embodiments are included below including to implement or otherwise support the use of defined policies.

Network node monikers may have various forms in various embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments a network node moniker in use with a managed computer network for a client may be a variable length textual string that includes any valid characters such as any ASCII character American Standard Code for Information Interchange characters any Unicode character etc. optionally with one or more characters or character sequences that are reserved for special uses and or that are indicated to be invalid for use e.g. one or more such reserved and or invalid characters or character sequences specified by the client and or by the configurable network service . In other embodiments and situations some or all of the network node monikers for one or more clients may be restricted in one or more manners such as to have a fixed length or other defined formatting e.g. if the configurable network service defines a particular hierarchical structure for at least some network node monikers of at least some managed computer networks . In general a network node moniker in use with a managed computer network for a client enables the client to specify a particular textual string for a particular computing node that is meaningful to that client such as based on one or more characteristics of the computing node including from the following non exclusive list a geographical location of the computing node a network topological location of the computing node e.g. belonging to a particular subnet a functionality of the associated computing node an organizational or other affiliation within the client for the computing node etc. In addition in at least some embodiments and situations the configurable network service and or a particular client may specify multiple types of network node monikers and or specialized uses for particular network node monikers or moniker types such as to use particular character sequences e.g. a textual word or phrase to have associated policies or other specialized handling e.g. a particular textual phrase that specifies a level of priority if used at a specified location within a network node moniker such as at the beginning at the end in any location etc. to have network node monikers with multiple parts having different uses etc. Thus in some embodiments a numeric IPv4 network address or other numeric network address may be considered to be a specialized form of a network node moniker in which the network node monikers have a fixed length and a defined format and the textual characters are numbers or special dot connectors e.g. . . In at least some embodiments and situations groups of multiple network node monikers in use with a managed computer network for a client may also be associated in particular manners such as to have a group of network node monikers that share a common policy or that are of a common type e.g. each represent a load balanced destination having two or more associated computing nodes to have multiple hierarchical levels of network node monikers such that network node monikers have defined relationships to other network node monikers at higher or lower hierarchical levels e.g. lower or higher relative priority more or less specialized policies etc. etc. such groupings of network node monikers may be defined by the configurable network service and or by particular clients in particular embodiments such as if the configurable network service defines a specific hierarchical structure of network node monikers to be used for at least some computing nodes of at least some managed computer networks. Furthermore in at least some embodiments network node monikers are tracked and used separately by the configurable network service for each client and or each managed computer network such that each such client or managed computer network has a distinct moniker namespace e.g. to enable different namespaces to use the same network node moniker in different manners .

Particular network node monikers in use with a managed computer network for a client may be specified in various manners including to be defined by the client or in some embodiments by the configurable network service e.g. in a random manner optionally by selecting from a predefined list of candidate network node monikers . When defined by a client the client may specify particular network node monikers in various manners such as by having a user representative of the client interactively use a GUI graphical user interface provided by the configurable network service for that purpose and or by having an executing program of the client interact with an API application programming interface provided by the configurable network service for that purpose. As one example a client may specify a particular network node moniker to be used with one or more particular computing nodes or may instead define one or more network node monikers to be assigned to particular computing nodes by the configurable network service e.g. in a manner analogous to DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol . Alternatively in some embodiments a client may interact directly with a particular computing node to designate a particular network node moniker that the computing node is to use and if so that computing node may optionally claim that designated network node moniker for itself without further configuration of the configurable network service by the client e.g. by the computing node broadcasting that it uses the designated network node moniker such as in a manner analogous to a gratuitous ARP or Address Resolution Protocol message .

As noted above a network node moniker may in some embodiments and situations be designated to represent one or more particular associated computing nodes of one or more managed computer networks such that a communication directed to that network node moniker will be forwarded to a designated network interface of at least one or all of those associated computing nodes e.g. in accordance with a defined policy associated with the network node moniker . In addition in some embodiments at least some network node monikers may further be associated with other information in addition to a network interface of a particular computing node such as to be associated with one or more of the following a particular communication endpoint port e.g. a TCP or Transmission Control Protocol port a UDP or User Datagram Protocol port etc. a particular networking protocol e.g. TCP UDP FTP HTTP etc. a particular software application or other computing resource located within or otherwise accessible via a particular computing node etc. In such embodiments the communication manager modules associated with the sending and or destination computing nodes may take further actions to facilitate such functionality. For example a destination communication manager module associated with an intended computing node may receive a substrate encoded network packet or other communication from a communication manager module associated with a sending computing node with the received communication being sent to a particular network node moniker that is associated with a particular endpoint port and software application if so the destination communication manager module may decode and optionally otherwise modify the received communication before passing it to the intended computing node with the modified received communication including information and or being passed by the destination communication manager module in a manner that directs the modified received communication to the associated particular endpoint port and software application. It will be appreciated that a communication may be directed to a particular software application in various manners such as based on use of a particular associated endpoint port use of shared memory accessible to that particular software application use of one or more particular identifiers specific to that particular software application etc.

By using the described techniques to manage and use network node monikers a variety of benefits may be achieved. For example in systems that use traditional IP addresses and associated DNS names Domain Name System names a variety of complexities and other problems occur with respect to managing and using two different naming and addressing schemes including significant delays in propagating updates when a change occurs between a DNS name and an associated IP address to which it is mapped conversely by using a single addressing scheme based on network node monikers such problems are minimized or eliminated and the use of DNS names may optionally be eliminated in at least some such embodiments. Similarly using a single addressing scheme based on network node monikers for a virtual computer network enables the elimination of the use of any other addressing schemes for the virtual computer network in at least some embodiments including any network addresses e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and any hardware addresses e.g. MAC or Media Access Control addresses such as if a network node moniker for a computing node is mapped to the substrate network address for that computing node and if the communication manager modules directly translate between such network node monikers and substrate network addresses. In addition the defined formats for and restrictions on particular names and addresses within DNS names and IP addresses create limits on how clients can designate group and manage particular computing nodes and groups of computing nodes in ways that are meaningful to the clients conversely in at least some embodiments an addressing scheme based on network node monikers may flexibly support a variety of different client needs and uses including to allow different clients to simultaneously use different network node monikers addressing scheme rules and policies on a single substrate network. Various other benefits may similarly be provided by the use of network node monikers in at least some embodiments.

In addition in some embodiments virtual network addresses e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 network addresses may be used with at least some managed computer networks whether instead of or in addition to network node monikers. In such embodiments various of the described techniques noted above may similarly be used with virtual network addresses including to define and implement associated policies to provide differential treatment for some virtual network addresses relative to other virtual network addresses etc. In addition by mapping a particular virtual network address for a particular client to a particular location in the substrate network and by enabling that mapping information to be dynamically updated and rapidly propagated to affected communication manager modules the functionality to be provided in conjunction with that particular virtual network address may be easily moved from one computing node within the managed computer network to another computing node within the managed computer network while the managed computer network continues to be in use including while communications continue to be routed to that virtual network address . In such situations the communication manager modules of the configurable network service may facilitate the dynamic modification of use of a particular virtual network address by immediately routing new communications intended for that particular virtual network address to the computing node that is newly associated with the particular virtual network address or may manage the change to the newly associated computing node in other manners if so configured such as in manners described in greater detail with respect to network node monikers. The configurable network service may further facilitate such dynamic computing node changes for virtual network addresses in additional manners in at least some embodiments including by sending communications to a computing node that will be newly designated with a particular virtual network address to alert the computing node of the new designation e.g. to prompt the computing node to use the new virtual network address designation to identify itself when sending communications to accept and manage communications that it receives that are directed to the new virtual network address designation and or to initiate one or more network routing related messages to claim the new virtual network address .

Network node monikers may be implemented and used in differing manners in at least some embodiments and situations including the following non exclusive list a particular network node moniker may be used by multiple computing nodes in a serial and or simultaneous manner a particular computing node may use multiple network node monikers in a serial and or simultaneous manner certain computing nodes may not use any network node monikers at certain times e.g. for a hot swap backup computing node that is not currently sending or receiving any communications different managed computer networks sharing a single substrate network may use different types of network node monikers and or other addressing schemes such as to have a first such managed computer network that uses network node monikers while a second such managed computer network simultaneously uses IPv4 Internet Protocol version 4 or IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6 network addresses a single managed computer network may use different types of network node monikers and or other addressing schemes such as for different nodes e.g. to have a first group of computing nodes of the managed computer network that uses network node monikers while a second group of computing nodes of the managed computer network simultaneously uses IPv4 or IPv6 network addresses or to have one or more computing nodes of the managed computer network that uses one or more network node monikers and one or more IPv4 or IPv6 network addresses in a serial and or simultaneous manner etc. It will be appreciated that other network addressing schemes than IPv4 and IPv6 may in some embodiments be used instead of or in addition to IPv4 and IPv6 in one or more of the manners described above.

As noted above in at least some embodiments the described techniques include managing communications for a managed computer network being provided including in embodiments in which the managed computer network is a virtual computer network that is overlaid on one or more underlying substrate computer networks. In such embodiments communications may be encoded in various manners before being sent over an underlying substrate network e.g. to use substrate network addresses for the communication source and or final destination in the encoded communication that correspond to locations within the substrate network and that are distinct from any network node monikers and or virtual network addresses used for the communication source and or final destination in the original pre encoded communication and the described techniques may be used in conjunction with such encoded communications as discussed in greater detail below. Before discussing some additional details of managing such communications in particular manners however some aspects of such managed computer networks in at least some embodiments are introduced. In the following examples the use of substrate network addresses is contrasted with the use of separate virtual network addresses although it will be appreciated that network node monikers may instead be used in such examples in place of such virtual network addresses as is discussed in greater detail with respect to the examples of and elsewhere.

In particular a managed computer network between multiple computing nodes may be provided in various ways in various embodiments such as in the form of a virtual computer network that is created as an overlay network using one or more intermediate physical networks that separate the multiple computing nodes. In such embodiments the intermediate physical network s may be used as a substrate network on which the overlay virtual computer network is provided with messages between computing nodes of the overlay virtual computer network being passed over the intermediate physical network s but with the existence and use of the intermediate physical network s being transparent to the computing nodes e.g. with the computing nodes being unaware of and or being unable to detect the intermediate physical networks in at least some such embodiments. For example the multiple computing nodes may each have a distinct physical substrate network address that corresponds to a location of the computing node within the intermediate physical network s such as a substrate IP Internet Protocol network address e.g. an IP network address that is specified in accordance with IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4 or in accordance with IPv6 or Internet Protocol version 6 such as to reflect the networking protocol used by the intermediate physical networks . In other embodiments a substrate network on which a virtual computer network is overlaid may itself include or be composed of one or more other virtual computer networks such as other virtual computer networks implemented by one or more third parties e.g. by an operator or provider of Internet or telecom infrastructure .

When computing nodes are selected to participate in a managed computer network that is being provided on behalf of a client user or other client entity and that is a virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network each computing node may be assigned one or more virtual network addresses for the provided virtual computer network that are unrelated to those computing nodes substrate network addresses such as from a range of virtual network addresses used for the provided virtual computer network in at least some embodiments and situations the virtual computer network being provided may further use a networking protocol that is different from the networking protocol used by the substrate network e.g. with the virtual computer network using the IPv4 networking protocol and the substrate computer network using the IPv6 networking protocol . The computing nodes of the virtual computer network inter communicate using the virtual network addresses e.g. by sending a communication to another destination computing node by specifying that destination computing node s virtual network address as the destination network address for the communication but the substrate network may be configured to route or otherwise forward communications based on substrate network addresses e.g. by physical network router devices and other physical networking devices of the substrate network . If so the overlay virtual computer network may be implemented from the logical edge of the intermediate physical network s by modifying the communications that enter the intermediate physical network s to encode the communications for the intermediate physical networks e.g. to use substrate network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the substrate network and by modifying the communications that leave the intermediate physical network s to decode the communications e.g. to use virtual network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the virtual computer network if the decoded communication is to be provided to a computing node of the virtual computer network to use external public network addresses if the decoded communication is to be forwarded over one or more external public networks etc. . As previously noted network node monikers may in some embodiments be used instead of virtual network addresses such as part of an alternative addressing scheme such that the encoding and decoding of network packets and other network communications varies between the use of network node monikers and substrate network addresses. Additional details related to the provision of such an overlay virtual computer network are included below.

In at least some embodiments a network accessible configurable network service CNS is provided by a corresponding CNS system and the CNS system provides managed overlay virtual computer networks to remote customers e.g. users and other entities or other clients such as by providing and using numerous computing nodes that are in one or more geographical locations e.g. in one or more data centers and that are inter connected via one or more intermediate physical networks. The CNS system may use various communication manager modules and optionally edge modules that perform functionality of communication manager modules at the edge of the one or more intermediate physical networks to manage communications for the various overlay virtual computer networks as they enter and leave the intermediate physical network s and may use one or more system manager modules to coordinate other operations of the CNS system. For example to enable the communication manager modules to manage communications for the overlay virtual computer networks being provided the CNS system may track and use various information about the computing nodes and any external nodes of each virtual computer network being managed such as to map the substrate network address of each such computing node to the one or more overlay virtual network addresses or network node monikers associated with the computing node and such as to map the external network address of each such group of one or more external nodes and the substrate network address of an associated edge module to the one or more overlay virtual network addresses or network node monikers associated with the external node s . Such mapping and other information may be stored and propagated in various manners in various embodiments including centrally or in a distributed manner as discussed in greater detail below.

Furthermore in order to provide managed virtual computer networks to users and other entities in a desired manner the CNS system allows users and other entities to interact with the CNS system in at least some embodiments to configure a variety of types of information for virtual computer networks that are provided by the CNS system on behalf of the users or other entities and may track and use such configuration information as part of providing those virtual computer networks. The configuration information for a particular managed virtual computer network having multiple computing nodes and external nodes may include for example one or more of the following non exclusive list a quantity of the multiple computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network one or more particular computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network one or more external nodes to associate with the virtual computer network a range or other group of multiple virtual network addresses to associate with the multiple computing nodes and or external nodes of the virtual computer network particular virtual network addresses to associate with particular computing nodes particular groups of related computing nodes a type of at least some of the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network such as to reflect quantities and or types of computing resources to be included with or otherwise available to the computing nodes a geographic location at which some or all of the computing nodes of the virtual computer network are to be located network topology information for the virtual computer network such as to specify logical subnets and or other logical topology of the virtual computer network information about any access restrictions involving particular types of communications and or particular destinations that are allowed or disallowed for particular computing nodes and or external nodes policies or other defined behavior to be associated with particular virtual network addresses and or particular network node monikers multiple network node monikers to associate with the multiple computing nodes and or external nodes of the virtual computer network particular network node monikers to associate with particular computing nodes etc. In addition the configuration information for a virtual computer network may be specified by a user or other entity in various manners in various embodiments such as by an executing program of the user or other entity that interacts with an API application programming interface provided by the CNS system for that purpose and or by a user that interactively uses a GUI graphical user interface provided by the CNS system for that purpose.

In particular in the illustrated example of a configurable network service CNS is available that provides functionality to clients not shown over one or more public networks e.g. over the Internet to enable the clients to access and use managed computer networks provided to the clients by the CNS including to enable the remote clients to dynamically modify and extend the capabilities of their remote existing private computer networks using cloud computing techniques over the public network . In the example of a number of clients interact over the public network with a system manager module of the CNS to create and configure various managed computer networks being provided by the CNS with at least some of the provided computer networks optionally being private computer network extensions to remote existing client private networks or otherwise connected to one or more such remote existing client private networks and with at least some such of those provided computer network extensions being configured to enable access from one or more corresponding client private networks over the public network e.g. private access via VPN connections established over interconnections and or access via other types of private or non private interconnections . In this example embodiment the system manager module assists in providing functionality of the CNS to the remote clients such as in conjunction with various optional other modules of the CNS e.g. various communication manager modules edge modules etc. in conjunction with various optional computing nodes and or networking devices e.g. substrate network router devices edge devices etc. that are used by the CNS to provide the managed computer networks . In at least some embodiments the CNS system manager module may execute on one or more computing systems not shown of the CNS and may provide one or more APIs that enable remote computing systems to programmatically interact with the module to access some or all functionality of the CNS on behalf of clients e.g. to create configure and or initiate use of managed computer networks . In addition in at least some embodiments clients may instead manually interact with the module e.g. via a GUI provided by the module to perform some or all such actions.

The public network in may be for example a publicly accessible network of linked networks possibly operated by distinct parties such as the Internet. The remote client private networks may each include one or more existing private networks such as a corporate or other private network e.g. home university etc. that is partially or wholly inaccessible to non privileged users and that includes computing systems and or other networked devices not shown of a client. In the illustrated example the provided computer networks each include multiple computing nodes not shown at least some of which may be from the plurality of optional computing nodes provided by or otherwise under the control of the CNS while in other embodiments at least some other computing systems may be used to provide some or all computing nodes for one or more of the provided computer networks such other computing systems may for example be provided by or under control of the client for whom a computer network that uses those other computing systems is provided or may be computing systems that are provided by third parties e.g. for a fee . In addition one or more of the provided computer networks may each include one or more external nodes that are integrated into the provided computer network such as an external node that is one of the other computing systems e.g. operated under control of an entity other than a provider or operator of the configurable network service such as a client to whom the computer network is provided or instead a third party to the client and the configurable network service provider or that is located within one of the private networks for the client to whom the computer network is provided e.g. operated under control of the client . Each of the provided computer networks may be configured in various ways by the clients for whom they are provided and may each be a private computer network that is accessible only by the client that creates it although in other embodiments at least some computer networks provided by the CNS for clients may be publicly accessible. Similarly while at least some of the provided computer networks in the example may be extensions to or otherwise connected with remote client computer networks that are private networks in other embodiments the provided computer networks may be standalone computer networks that are not connected to other existing computer networks and or may be extensions to or otherwise connected with other client computer networks that are not private networks.

Private access between a remote client private computer network and a corresponding private computer network provided for a client may be enabled in various ways such as by establishing a VPN connection or other private connection between them that allows intercommunication over the public network in a private manner. For example the CNS may automatically perform appropriate configuration on its computing nodes and other networking devices to enable VPN access to a particular private network of a client such as by automatically configuring one or more VPN mechanisms hosted by the CNS e.g. software and or hardware VPN mechanisms and or may automatically provide appropriate configuration information to the client e.g. credentials access points and or other parameters to allow a VPN mechanism hosted on the remote client private network e.g. a software VPN endpoint that is provided by one of the multiple computing nodes of the provided network to establish the VPN access. After VPN access has been appropriately enabled and or configured a VPN connection may be established between the remote client private network and the provided private computer network such as initiated by the client using IPsec Internet Protocol Security or instead a VPN connection or other private connection may be established to or between networks that use MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching for data transmission or other appropriate communication technologies. In addition in the illustrated example various network accessible remote resource services may optionally be available to remote computing systems over the public network including to computing nodes on the remote client private networks . The resource services may provide various functionality to the remote computing nodes such as for at least some of the resource services to provide remote computing nodes with access to various types of network accessible computing related resources e.g. long term storage capabilities such as block storage that is mountable by particular computing nodes of the provided computer networks or storage that is otherwise accessible from particular computing nodes of the provided computer networks using API calls . Furthermore at least some of the computer networks that are provided by the CNS may be configured to provide access to at least some of the remote resource services with that provided access optionally appearing to computing nodes of the provided computer networks as being locally provided via virtual connections that are part of the provided computer networks although the actual communications with the remote resource services may occur over the public networks e.g. via interconnections and . In addition in at least some embodiments multiple distinct provided computer networks may be configured to enable inter access with each other.

The provided computer networks may each be configured by clients in various manners. For example in at least some embodiments the CNS provides various computing nodes that are available for use with computer networks provided to clients such that each provided computer network may include a client configured quantity of multiple such computing nodes that are dedicated for use as part of that provided computer network. In particular a client may interact with the module to configure a quantity of computing nodes to initially be included in a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS . In addition the CNS may provide multiple different types of computing nodes in at least some embodiments such as for example computing nodes with various performance characteristics e.g. processor speed memory available storage available etc. and or other capabilities. If so in at least some such embodiments a client may specify the types of computing nodes to be included in a provided computer network for the client. In addition in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure network node monikers and or virtual network addresses for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS and network node monikers and or virtual network addresses may later be dynamically added removed or modified for a provided computer network of a client in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client. Furthermore in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure network topology information for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS including to specify one or more external nodes for the provided computer network and such network topology information may later be dynamically modified for a provided computer network in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client. Moreover in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure various network access constraint information for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS and such network access constraint information may later be dynamically modified for a provided computer network in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client.

Network node monikers and or network addresses may be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example the client may specify one or more address ranges e.g. a Classless Inter Domain Routing CIDR address block or other groups of network addresses for the provided computer network such that at least some of the specified network addresses are used for the computing nodes of the provided computer network and with those specified network addresses optionally being a subset of network addresses used by an existing remote client computer network if the provided computer network is configured to be an extension to the remote client computer network. Such configured network addresses may in some situations be virtual or private network addresses that are not directly addressable from computing systems on the public network e.g. if the existing remote client computer network and the corresponding provided network extension use network address translation techniques and or virtual networking techniques for the client computer network and its provided network extension while in other situations at least some of the configured network addresses may be external public network addresses that are directly addressable from computing systems on the public network e.g. a public network address that is a static Internet routable IP address or other non changing network address . Similarly specified network node monikers may in some embodiments and situations be private and not directly addressable from computing systems on the public network while in other embodiments and situations at least some of the computing nodes may be publicly addressable whether by exposing particular network node monikers to external computer systems directly or instead exposing external public network addresses that are directly addressable from computing systems on the public network e.g. a public network address that is a static Internet routable IP address or other non changing network address and that are mapped to particular internal network node monikers e.g. by using techniques analogous to network address translation and or port address translation for the client computer network and its provided network extension . In other embodiments the CNS may automatically select network node monikers and or network addresses to be assigned to at least some computing nodes of at least some provided computer networks and or at least some external nodes of at least some provided computer networks such as based on network node monikers and or network addresses that are available for use by the CNS based on selecting network node monikers and or network addresses that are related to network addresses used by remote existing computer networks corresponding to the provided computer networks etc. Furthermore if two or more of the computer networks provided by the CNS are configured to enable inter communications between the provided computer networks e.g. for two or more computer networks provided to a single customer such as for different departments or groups within a single organization for two or more computer networks provided to two or more distinct customers etc. the CNS may in some embodiments automatically select network node monikers and or network addresses to be used for at least some computing nodes of those provided computer networks to facilitate the inter communications such as by using different network node monikers and or network addresses for the various provided computer networks. In addition in at least some embodiments in which the CNS provides virtual networks to clients such as by using overlay networks on a substrate network each client may be allowed to specify any network node monikers and or network addresses to be used for their provided computer networks even if multiple clients specify the same or overlapping network node monikers and or network addresses for their respective provided computer networks in such embodiments the CNS manages the network node monikers and or network addresses distinctly for each client such that a first client may have a first computing node associated with a particular specified network address for the first client s provided computer network while a distinct second client may have a distinct second computing node associated with the same particular specified network address for the second client s provided computer network. Once network node monikers and or network addresses are configured or otherwise determined for a provided computer network the CNS may assign the network node monikers and or network addresses to various of the computing nodes selected for the provided computer network such as in a random manner by using DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or other techniques for dynamic assignment etc.

Network topology information may be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example a client may specify particular types of networking devices e.g. routers switches etc. and or other network devices or nodes e.g. load balancers firewalls proxies network storage devices printers etc. to be part of the provided computer network and may specify interconnectivity information between networking devices and computing nodes. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the CNS may provide available computing nodes in multiple geographical locations e.g. in multiple geographically distributed data centers and the configuration information specified by a client for a provided computer network may further indicate one or more geographical locations in which computing nodes of the provided computer network are to be located e.g. to provide fault tolerance among the computing nodes of a provided computer network by having them located in multiple geographical locations and or may otherwise provide information about preferences or requirements of how the computing nodes of the provided computer network are to interoperate that is used by the CNS to select one or more such geographical locations e.g. minimum or maximum network latency or bandwidth for computing node intercommunications minimum or maximum network proximity between computing nodes minimum or maximum geographic proximity between computing nodes having local access to particular resources or functionality that is not available in all such geographic locations having specified locations relative to other external computing systems such as to a remote computer network of the client and or to a remote resource service constraints or other preferences based on the cost of obtaining use of particular computing nodes and or for particular types of interactions with particular computing nodes such as costs associated with providing data to and or from those computing nodes etc. . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in at least some embodiments the interconnections and intercommunications between computing nodes of a provided computer network are managed using an underlying substrate network not shown of the CNS and if so some or all of the configured network topology information may be simulated or otherwise emulated in at least some such embodiments using the underlying substrate network and corresponding modules of the CNS . For example each of the computing nodes provided by the CNS may be associated with a node communication manager module of the CNS that manages communications to and from its associated computing node s and if so the associated communication manager module for a computing node may take various actions to emulate desired functionality of a network with respect to that computing node as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Similarly one or more external nodes may be specified for a particular provided virtual computer network and each of the external nodes may be associated with an edge module of the CNS that manages communications to and from its associated external node s and if so the associated edge module for an external node may take various actions to emulate desired functionality of a network with respect to that external node as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Network access constraint information may also be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example a client may specify information about whether and how some or all of the computing nodes of a provided computer network are allowed to communicate with other computing nodes of the provided computer network and or with other computing systems external to the provided computer network such as based on one or more of the following directions of communications incoming versus outgoing types of communications e.g. based on the types of content included and or the types of communication protocols used such as to allow HTTP requests for text but not images and to not allow FTP requests locations of other computing systems e.g. whether part of the provided computer network part of a remote client computer network corresponding to the provided computer network part of a remote resource service to which access has been established external to the provided computer network and any corresponding remote client computer network etc. types of other computing systems etc. In a manner similar to that for network topology information the CNS may enforce network access constraint information for provided computer networks in various manners.

Thus managed computer networks may be provided for clients in various manners in various embodiments and may be configured to have various types of functionality in various embodiments.

In addition in at least some embodiments the computing nodes of the managed computer networks may be physical computing systems and or may be virtual machines that are each hosted on one or more physical computing systems and the communications that are handled for managed computer networks may include transmissions of data e.g. messages packets frames streams etc. in various formats. As previously noted some or all computing nodes used for a particular provided overlay virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided by the CNS system for use by users while in other embodiments some or all such computing nodes may instead be provided by a user who uses those computing nodes. Similarly external nodes may have various forms and be provided by the CNS system or by other entities that are unrelated to the operator of the CNS system in various embodiments. Furthermore in at least some situations an embodiment of the CNS system may be part of or otherwise affiliated with a program execution service or PES that executes multiple programs on behalf of multiple customers or other users of the service such as a program execution service that uses multiple computing systems on multiple physical networks e.g. multiple physical computing systems and networks within a data center . In at least some such embodiments virtual computer networks to which computing nodes belong may be selected based on associated users such as based on the computing nodes executing programs on behalf of a user or other entity.

As previously noted a virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided as an overlay network that uses one or more intermediate physical networks as a substrate network and one or more such overlay virtual computer networks may be implemented over the substrate network in various ways in various embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments communications between nodes of an overlay virtual computer network are managed by encoding and sending those communications over the substrate network without encapsulating the communications such as by embedding network node monikers and or virtual network address information for a computing node of the virtual computer network e.g. the destination computing node s network node moniker and or virtual network address in a larger physical network address space used for a networking protocol of the one or more intermediate physical networks while in other embodiments the communications are encoded in other manners e.g. by storing network node monikers and or virtual network address information from the pre encoded communication in one or more header fields of the encoded communication or otherwise in a manner associated with the encoded communications such as if the overlay virtual computer network and underlying substrate network use the same networking protocol . As one illustrative example a virtual computer network may be implemented using 32 bit IPv4 network addresses and those 32 bit virtual network addresses may be embedded as part of 128 bit IPv6 network addresses used by the one or more intermediate physical networks such as by reheadering communication packets or other data transmissions e.g. using Stateless IP ICMP Translation or SIIT or otherwise modifying such data transmissions to translate them from a first networking protocol for which they are configured to a distinct second networking protocol. As another illustrative example both the virtual computer network and substrate computer network may be implemented using the same network addressing protocol e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 and data transmissions sent via the provided overlay virtual computer network using virtual network addresses may be modified to use different physical network addresses corresponding to the substrate network while the transmissions are sent over the substrate network but with the original virtual network addresses being stored in the modified data transmissions or otherwise tracked so that the data transmissions may be restored to their original form when they exit the substrate network. In other embodiments at least some of the overlay computer networks may be implemented using encapsulation of communications. Additional details related to SIIT are available at Request For Comments 2765 Stateless IP ICMP Translation Algorithm February 2000 Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This document is also available at the time of filing at toolsietforghtmlrfc2765 where and are replaced by the corresponding characters with those names . and respectively .

Furthermore in addition to managing configured network topologies for provided virtual computer networks the CNS system may use the described techniques to provide various other benefits in various situations such as limiting communications to and or from computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network to other computing nodes that belong to that virtual computer network. In this manner computing nodes that belong to multiple virtual computer networks may share parts of one or more intermediate physical networks while still maintaining network isolation for computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network. In addition the use of the described techniques also allows computing nodes to easily be added to and or removed from a virtual computer network such as to allow a user to dynamically modify the size of a virtual computer network e.g. to dynamically modify the quantity of computing nodes to reflect an amount of current need for more or less computing resources . Furthermore the use of the described techniques also supports changes to an underlying substrate network for example if the underlying substrate network is expanded to include additional computing nodes at additional geographical locations existing or new virtual computer networks being provided may seamlessly use those additional computing nodes since the underlying substrate network will route communications to and from the substrate network addresses for those additional computing nodes in the same manner as for other previously existing substrate network computing nodes. In at least some embodiments the underlying substrate network may be of any size e.g. spanning multiple countries or continents without regard to network latency between computing nodes at different locations.

At least some such benefits may similarly apply for logical sub networks or subnets that are specified for such a particular provided virtual computer network with the substrate network functionality used to emulate various functionality corresponding to the specified logical subnets. For example the use of the underlying substrate network may enable different computing nodes assigned to a particular logical subnet to be located at any position within the substrate network with the substrate network forwarding communications to destination computing nodes based on those destination computing nodes substrate network addresses. As such the substrate network may support specified logical subnets or other configured network topology for a managed computer network without any configuration for or other use of information about such specified logical subnets and with the CNS system modules e.g. communication manager modules instead managing the corresponding functionality from the logical edges of the substrate network where the CNS system modules connect to the substrate network.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which specific types of computing nodes networks communications network topologies and configuration operations are performed including with respect to use of virtual network addresses and or network node monikers in particular situations. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity and the inventive techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations some of which are discussed below.

The illustrated example includes an example data center with multiple physical computing systems operated on behalf of the CNS system. The example data center is connected via one or more edge devices to an internet external to the data center which provides access to one or more computing systems and possible external nodes located within private network to one or more other globally accessible data centers that each have multiple computing systems not shown and may include possible external nodes not shown and to one or more other computing systems that may also be possible external nodes. Some or all of the edge devices may be configured to operate as or otherwise implement one or more edge modules to manage external nodes including to provide functionality of communication manager modules. The internet may be for example a publicly accessible network of networks possibly operated by various distinct parties such as the Internet and the private network may be for example a corporate network that is wholly or partially inaccessible from computing systems external to the private network . Computing systems may be for example home computing systems or mobile computing devices that each connects directly to the Internet e.g. via a telephone line cable modem a Digital Subscriber Line DSL cellular network or other wireless connection etc. .

The example data center includes a number of physical computing systems and as well as a Communication Manager module that executes on one or more other computing systems or devices not shown to manage communications for the associated computing systems and a System Manager module that executes on one or more computing systems not shown . In this example each physical computing system hosts multiple virtual machine computing nodes and includes an associated virtual machine VM communication manager module e.g. as part of a virtual machine hypervisor monitor for the physical computing system such as VM Communication Manager module and multiple virtual machines on host computing system and such as VM Communication Manager module and multiple virtual machines on host computing system . Physical computing systems do not execute any virtual machines in this example and thus may each act as a computing node that directly executes one or more software programs on behalf of a user. The Communication Manager module that manages communications for the associated computing systems may be implemented as part of various types of devices separate from the physical computing systems such as for example a proxy computing device a firewall device or a networking device e.g. a switch router hub etc. through which communications to and from the physical computing systems travel. In other embodiments all or none of the physical computing systems at the data center may host virtual machines.

This example data center further includes multiple physical networking devices such as switches edge router devices and core router devices . Switch is part of a physical sub network that includes physical computing systems and is connected to edge router . Switch is part of a distinct physical sub network that includes physical computing systems and as well as the computing systems providing the Communication Manager module and the System Manager module and is connected to edge router . The physical sub networks established by switches in turn are connected to each other and other networks e.g. the internet via an intermediate interconnection network which includes the edge routers and the core routers . The edge routers provide gateways between two or more physical sub networks or networks. For example edge router provides a gateway between the physical sub network established by switch and the interconnection network while edge router provides a gateway between the interconnection network and internet e.g. via the edge devices . The core routers manage communications within the interconnection network such as by routing or otherwise forwarding packets or other data transmissions as appropriate based on characteristics of such data transmissions e.g. header information including source and or destination substrate addresses protocol identifiers etc. and or the characteristics of the interconnection network itself e.g. routes based on the physical network topology etc. . In addition the edge devices may further manage communications between computing nodes at the data center and other external computer systems that are not external nodes integrated into one or more virtual computer networks overlaid on the substrate interconnection network e.g. external computing systems external computing systems computing systems at other external data centers etc. .

The illustrated System Manager module Communication Manager modules and edge modules may perform at least some of the described techniques in order to configure authorize and otherwise manage communications sent to and from associated computing nodes including to support providing various virtual networking functionality for one or more virtual computer networks that are provided using various of the computing nodes and or to support providing various emulated functionality for one or more virtual networking devices that are configured for one or more such provided virtual computer networks. For example Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes and each of the other Communication Manager modules may similarly manage communications for a group of one or more other associated computing nodes. In addition some or all of those computing nodes may be configured to use an alternative computer networking stack that supports the use at the layer 3 network layer of network node monikers for network packets and other network communications with the associated Communication Manager modules being configured to support such functionality but without modifying any of the switches edge routers and core routers of the substrate interconnection network to support the use of the network node monikers. The illustrated Communication Manager modules may configure communications between computing nodes so as to overlay one or more particular virtual networks over one or more intermediate physical networks that are used as a substrate network such as over the interconnection network . Furthermore a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in some embodiments by using the edge modules to assist in integrating one or more external nodes outside of the data center into the virtual computer network. In other embodiments a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in other manners such as if one or more other data centers also provide computing nodes that are available for use by the example CNS system and the particular virtual network includes computing nodes at two or more such data centers at two or more distinct geographical locations. Multiple such data centers or other geographical locations of one or more computing nodes may be inter connected in various manners including the following directly via one or more public networks in a non private manner or via a private connection not shown e.g. a dedicated physical connection that is not shared with any third parties such as a leased line or other direct circuit or a VPN or other mechanism that provides the private connection over a public network etc. In addition while not illustrated here other such data centers or other geographical locations may each include one or more other Communication Manager modules that manage communications for computing systems at that data center or other geographical location as well as over the global internet to the data center and any other such data centers .

In addition a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in other manners in other embodiments such as if one or more other Communication Manager modules at the data center are placed between edge router and the global internet e.g. if the edge devices each provide at least some of the functionality of a Communication Manager module in encoding and decoding communications for virtual computer networks to use the underlying substrate network or instead based on one or more other Communication Manager modules external to the data center e.g. if another Communication Manager module not shown is made part of private network so as to manage communications for computing systems over the internet and private network etc. . Thus for example if an organization operating private network desires to virtually extend its private computer network to one or more of the computing nodes of the data center it may do so by implementing one or more Communication Manager modules as part of the private network e.g. as part of the interface between the private network and the internet in this manner computing systems within the private network may communicate with those data center computing nodes as if those data center computing nodes were part of the private network. In other embodiments the private computer network may instead be extended to one or more computing nodes of the data center by the edge device of the data center managing the communications between computing nodes of the private network and particular data center computing nodes.

Thus as one illustrative example one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system in this example virtual machine computing node may be part of the same provided virtual computer network as one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system in this example virtual machine computing node and may further both be assigned to a specified logical subnet of that virtual computer network that includes a subset of the computing nodes for that virtual computer network such as with network node monikers and or virtual network addresses based on the IPv4 networking protocol being used for the virtual computer network. The virtual machine may then direct an outgoing communication not shown to the destination virtual machine computing node such as by specifying a network node moniker and or virtual network address for that destination virtual machine computing node e.g. a network node moniker and or virtual network address that is unique for the local broadcast domain of the specified logical subnet . The Communication Manager module receives the outgoing communication and in at least some embodiments determines whether to authorize the sending of the outgoing communication such as based on previously obtained information about the sending virtual machine computing node and or about the destination virtual machine computing node e.g. information about virtual computer networks and or entities with which the computing nodes are associated information about any specified logical subnets to which the computing nodes belong etc. and or by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module e.g. to obtain an authorization determination to obtain some or all such information etc. . By not delivering unauthorized communications to computing nodes network isolation and security of entities virtual computer networks is enhanced.

If the Communication Manager module determines that the outgoing communication is authorized or does not perform such an authorization determination the module determines the actual physical substrate network location corresponding to the destination network node moniker and or virtual network address for the communication. For example the Communication Manager module may determine the actual destination substrate network address to use for the network node moniker and or virtual network address of the destination virtual machine by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module or may have previously determined and stored that information e.g. in response to a request from the sending virtual machine for information about that destination network node moniker and or virtual network address such as a request that the virtual machine specifies using Address Resolution Protocol or ARP . The Communication Manager module then re headers or otherwise modifies the outgoing communication so that it is directed to Communication Manager module using an actual destination substrate network address such as if Communication Manager module is associated with a range of multiple such actual substrate network addresses. provide examples of doing such communication management in some embodiments for virtual network addresses and provide additional examples of doing such communication management in some embodiments for network node monikers.

When Communication Manager module receives the communication via the interconnection network in this example it obtains the destination network node moniker and or virtual network address for the communication e.g. by extracting the destination network node moniker and or virtual network address from the communication and determines to which of the virtual machine computing nodes managed by the Communication Manager module that the communication is directed. The Communication Manager module next determines whether the communication is authorized for the destination virtual machine computing node with examples of such authorization activities discussed in further detail in the examples of . If the communication is determined to be authorized or the Communication Manager module does not perform such an authorization determination the Communication Manager module then re headers or otherwise modifies the incoming communication so that it is directed to the destination virtual machine computing node using an appropriate network node moniker and or virtual network address for the virtual computer network such as by using the sending virtual machine computing node s network node moniker and or virtual network address as the source network address and by using the destination virtual machine computing node s network node moniker and or virtual network address as the destination address. The Communication Manager module then forwards or otherwise provides the modified communication to the destination virtual machine computing node such as via shared memory not shown of the computing system that is used to provide a logical network interface for the destination virtual machine computing node . In at least some embodiments before forwarding the incoming communication to the destination virtual machine the Communication Manager module may also perform additional steps related to security as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In addition while not illustrated in in some embodiments the various Communication Manager modules may take further actions to provide virtual networking functionality corresponding to a specified network topology for the provided virtual computer network e.g. for one or more virtual networking devices for the provided virtual computer network such as by managing communications between computing nodes of the provided virtual computer network in specified manners and by responding to other types of requests sent by computing nodes of the virtual computer network. For example although being separated from computing node on physical computing system by the interconnection network in the example embodiment of virtual machine computing node on physical computing system may be configured to be part of the same logical sub network of the virtual computer network as computing node e.g. to not be separated by any logical router devices specified for the provided virtual computer network . Conversely despite the physical proximity of virtual machine computing node on physical computing system to virtual machine computing node on physical computing system i.e. being part of the same physical sub network without any intervening physical substrate router devices in the example embodiment of computing node may be configured to be part of a distinct logical sub network of the virtual computer network from that of computing node e.g. may be configured to be separated by one or more specified router devices of the provided virtual computer network not shown which in this example are virtual router devices that are not physically provided for the virtual computer network . If computing nodes and are configured to be part of the same logical sub network the previous example of sending a communication from computing node to computing node may be performed in the manner previously described without emulating the actions of any intervening virtual router devices despite the use of multiple physical router devices in the substrate interconnection network for forwarding the communication since computing nodes and are configured to be part of single sub network in the specified network topology.

However if computing node sends an additional communication to computing node the Communication Manager modules and or on the host computing systems and may perform additional actions that correspond to one or more virtual specified router devices configured in the specified network topology for the provided virtual computer network to separate the computing nodes and . For example the source computing node may send the additional communication in such a manner as to initially direct it to a first of the virtual specified router devices that is configured to be local to computing node e.g. by including a virtual hardware address in the header of the additional communication that corresponds to that first virtual specified router device with that first virtual specified router device being expected to forward the additional communication on toward the destination computing node via the specified logical network topology. If so the source Communication Manager module may detect that forwarding of the additional communication to the virtual first router device e.g. based on the virtual hardware address used in the header of the additional communication or otherwise be aware of the configured network topology for the virtual computer network and may take actions to emulate functionality of some or all of the virtual specified router devices that are configured in the specified network topology to separate the computing nodes and . For example each virtual router device that forwards the additional communication may be expected to take actions such as modifying a TTL time to live hop value for the communication modify a virtual destination hardware address that is specified for the communication to indicate the next intended destination of the additional communication on a route to the destination computing node and or otherwise modify the communication header. If so the source Communication Manager module may perform some or all of those actions before forwarding the additional communication directly to the destination Communication Manager module over the substrate network in this case via physical switch device for provision to destination computing node . Alternatively some or all such additional actions to provide the virtual networking functionality for the sent additional communication may instead be performed by the destination Communication Manager module after the additional communication is forwarded to the Communication Manager module by the Communication Manager module

Furthermore as part of the prior continuing example computing node may determine to send a third communication to a final destination computer system external to the data center and the interconnection network such as to a particular external node that is integrated into the computer network to which computing node belongs or such as to a particular computing system e.g. with the particular computing system not being part of the virtual computer network to which computing node belongs . In this situation the Communication Manager module on the host computing system that is associated with the source computing node may further perform additional actions to support the use of an intermediate destination for the communication. If the third communication is being sent to a particular external node the Communication Manager module determines that the external node is associated with one of the edge devices and encodes the outgoing third communication from the source computing node for forwarding over the substrate network from the host computing system to that edge device . That edge device may be or have an edge module that receives the encoded third communication decodes the received communication by removing substrate specific information and or formatting determines a particular external network address of the destination external node e.g. based on a mapping of that external network address to a network node moniker and or virtual network address assigned to the destination external node optionally adds network identifying information to the decoded communication and forwards the decoded communication over the internet to the destination external node . For example in order to determine how to forward the third communication to the destination external node the edge device edge module may identify the type of encoding to use for that destination external node e.g. a particular publicly routable external network address associated with the destination external node such as to direct the communication to the edge of the private network and or various information specific to the private network such as information about a VLAN identifier or MPLS label that the private network uses to represent the managed virtual computer network and encode the communication accordingly and may further use a particular external connection e.g. a VPN connection over the internet . By providing virtual networking functionality using the described techniques the CNS system provides various benefits. For example because the various Communication Manager modules and edge modules manage the overlay virtual network specified networking devices and other network topology do not need to be physically implemented for virtual computer networks being provided and thus corresponding modifications are not needed to the interconnection network to support particular configured network topologies. Nonetheless if the computing nodes and software programs of a virtual computer network have been configured to expect a particular network topology for the provided virtual computer network the appearance and functionality of that network topology may nonetheless be transparently provided for those computing nodes by the described techniques. In addition the use of the described techniques by the CNS system enables external nodes to be integrated into virtual computer networks and used in specified manners such as to enable the virtual computer network to obtain access to functionality that may not otherwise be available.

Thus various aspects of providing managed computer networks are described above as well as elsewhere in this document including support for virtual computer networks that are overlaid on an underlying substrate network. In addition in at least some embodiments the CNS system may use multiple communication manager modules in additional manners such as to emulate responses to networking requests made by computing nodes in the manner of a local physical networking device including to respond to ping requests SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol queries etc. Furthermore as described in greater detail below in at least some embodiments multiple modules of the CNS system may operate together in a distributed manner to provide a particular type of functionality e.g. functionality corresponding to a particular logical networking device such that no single module or physical device is singly responsible for emulating that particular type of functionality as well as to provide functionality corresponding to integrating external nodes into virtual computer networks.

In particular illustrates various example computing nodes and that may communicate with each other by using one or more intermediate substrate networks . In this example IPv4 virtual computer networks are overlaid on an underlying substrate network that is a distinct IPv4 network although in other embodiments the substrate network and or overlay virtual computer networks may use other networking protocols. In addition in this example embodiment the computing nodes are operated on behalf of multiple distinct entities to whom managed computer networks are provided and a System Manager module manages the association of particular computing nodes with particular entities and managed virtual computer networks and tracks various configuration information specified for the managed virtual computer networks. The example computing nodes of include four computing nodes that are executed on behalf of an example entity Z and that are part of a corresponding first managed virtual computer network provided for client entity Z those being computing nodes and . In addition other computing nodes are operated on behalf of other entities and belong to other provided virtual computer networks such as computing node that is part of a second managed virtual computer network provided for client entity Y as well as other computing nodes .

In this example the computing nodes are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module R and the computing nodes are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module S although the physical connections are not illustrated in this example. The CNS Communication Manager modules and are physically connected to a substrate network as is the System Manager module although the additional physical interconnections between modules and the substrate network are also not illustrated in this example. As one example computing nodes may each be one of multiple virtual machines hosted by a single physical computing system and Communication Manager module R may be part of a hypervisor virtual machine monitor for that physical computing system if so communications between the computing nodes and the Communication Manager module R may be passed within that physical computing system without using any intervening computer network such as via memory of the physical computing system an internal bus of the physical computing system etc. For example with reference to computing nodes may represent the virtual machines and computing nodes may represent the virtual machines . If so Communication Manager module R would correspond to Communication Manager module of Communication Manager module S would correspond to Communication Manager module of the substrate network would correspond to interconnection network of and the System Manager module would correspond to System Manager module of . Alternatively computing nodes or may instead each be a distinct physical computing system such as to correspond to computing systems of or to computing nodes at other data centers or geographical locations e.g. computing systems at another data center computing systems etc. .

In this example each of the Communication Manager modules of is associated with a group of multiple physical substrate network addresses which the Communication Manager modules manage on behalf of their associated computing nodes although in other embodiments each Communication Manager module may instead use a single substrate network address that it shares among two or more associated computing nodes. For example with the substrate network being an IPv4 network in this example Communication Manager module R is associated with the IPv4 CIDR block 200.0.0.0 29 so as to enable at least some of the IPv4 addresses from 200.0.0.0 to 200.0.0.7 to each be treated as a substrate network address associated with one of the computing nodes and Communication Manager module S may similarly be associated with the 16 IPv4 network addresses in the IPv4 CIDR block 200.0.10.0 28. Alternatively if the substrate network were an IPv6 network Communication Manager module R may instead for example be associated with the IPv6 network address range of 0A 01 72 which corresponds to the 128 bit addresses in hexadecimal from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXA 0100 0000 0000 0000 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXA 01FF FFFF FFFF FFFF representing 2 to the power of 56 unique IPv6 addresses where each X may represent any hexadecimal character that is appropriate for a particular situation if so the substrate network will forward any communication with a destination network address in that range to Communication Manager module R and with the initial 72 bits of the range specified the Communication Manager module R may use the remaining available 56 bits to represent the computing nodes that it manages and to determine how to process incoming communications whose destination network addresses are in that range. If the substrate network were an IPv6 network the Communication Manager module S may similarly be associated with an IPv6 network address range such as 0B 02 72 .

For purposes of the example shown in computing nodes and are part of a single managed virtual computer network provided for entity Z and computing nodes and have assigned IPv4 virtual network addresses of 10.0.0.2 10.0.5.1 and 10.0.0.3 and substrate network addresses of 200.0.0.1 200.0.0.3 and 200.0.10.2 respectively. As discussed in greater detail subsequently computing node is configured in the network topology for the managed virtual computer network to have two associated virtual network addresses those being 10.0.0.9 and 10.0.5.9 and an associated substrate network address of 200.0.10.3 . Because computing node is part of a distinct managed virtual computer network that is provided for entity Y it can share the same virtual network address as computing node without confusion although it has a distinct substrate network address. In this example computing node A intends to communicate with computing node G with the two computing nodes configured in this example to be part of a single common physical local area sub network not shown in a configured network topology for the managed virtual computer network and the substrate network associated substrate network addresses and Communication Manager modules are transparent to computing nodes A and G in this example. In particular despite the physical separation of computing nodes A and G the Communication Manager modules and operate so as to overlay the managed virtual computer network for entity Z over the physical substrate network for communications between those computing nodes including to emulate functionality corresponding to the configured local area sub network of the managed virtual computer network so that the lack of an actual local area sub network is transparent to the computing nodes A and G.

In order to send the communication to computing node G computing node A exchanges various messages with Communication Manager module R despite in the illustrated embodiment being unaware of the existence of Communication Manager module R i.e. computing node A may believe that it is transmitting a broadcast message to all other nodes on the local sub network such as via a specified switching device that computing node A believes connects the nodes on the local sub network . In particular in this example computing node A first sends an ARP message request that includes the virtual network address for computing node G i.e. 10.0.0.3 and that requests the corresponding hardware address for computing node G e.g. a 48 bit MAC address . Communication Manager module R intercepts the ARP request and responds to computing node A with a spoofed ARP response message that includes a virtual hardware address for computing node G.

To obtain the virtual hardware address for computing node G to use with the response message the Communication Manager module R first checks a local store of information that maps virtual hardware addresses to corresponding actual physical substrate network addresses with each of the virtual hardware addresses also corresponding to an IPv4 virtual network address for a particular entity s managed virtual computer network. If the local store does not contain an entry for computing node G e.g. if none of the computing nodes have previously communicated with computing node G and the System Manager module does not push mapping information to the Communication Manager Module R without request if a prior entry in local store for computing node G has expired based on an associated expiration time etc. the Communication Manager module R interacts with System Manager module to obtain the corresponding actual physical substrate network address for computing node G on behalf of computing node A. In particular in this example the System Manager module maintains provisioning information that identifies where each computing node is actually located and to which entity and or managed virtual computer network the computing node belongs such as by initiating execution of programs on computing nodes for entities and virtual computer networks or by otherwise obtaining such provisioning information. As discussed in greater detail with respect to the System Manager module may determine whether the request from Communication Manager module R on behalf of computing node A for computing node G s actual physical substrate network address is valid including whether computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G e.g. such as based on being part of the same configured local area sub network and if so provides that actual physical substrate network address.

Communication Manager module R receives the actual physical substrate network address for computing node G from the System Manager module and stores this received information as part of an entry for computing node G as part of mapping information for later use optionally with an expiration time and or other information . In addition in this example Communication Manager module R determines a virtual hardware address to be used for computing node G e.g. by generating a dummy identifier that is locally unique for the computing nodes managed by Communication Manager module R stores that virtual hardware address in conjunction with the received actual physical substrate network address as part of the mapping information entry and provides the virtual hardware address to computing node A as part of response message . By maintaining such mapping information later communications from computing node A to computing node G may be authorized by Communication Manager module R without further interactions with the System Manager module based on the use of the virtual hardware address previously provided by Communication Manager module R. In some embodiments the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node G may not be a dummy address such as if System Manager module further maintains information about hardware addresses used by the various computing nodes e.g. virtual hardware addresses assigned to virtual machine computing nodes actual hardware addresses assigned to computing systems acting as computing nodes etc. and provides the hardware address used by computing node G to Communication Manager module R as part of the interactions . In such embodiments the Communication Manager module R may take further actions if computing nodes on different virtual networks use the same virtual hardware address such as to map each combination of computing node hardware address and managed virtual computer network to a corresponding substrate network address.

In other embodiments Communication Manager module R may interact with System Manager module to obtain a physical substrate network address for computing node G or otherwise determine such a physical substrate network address at times other than upon receiving an ARP request such as in response to any received communication that is directed to computing node G using the virtual network address 10.0.0.3 as part of entity Z s virtual computer network or if the System Manager module provides that information to Communication Manager module R without request e.g. periodically upon changes in the information etc. . Furthermore in other embodiments the virtual hardware addresses that are used may differ from this example such as if the virtual hardware addresses are specified by the System Manager module if the virtual hardware addresses are not random and instead store one or more types of information specific to the corresponding computing nodes etc. In addition in this example if computing node A had not been determined to be authorized to send communications to computing node G whether by the System Manager module and or Communication Manager module R Communication Manager module R would not send the response message with the virtual hardware address e.g. instead sends no response or an error message response .

In this example with the substrate network being an IPv4 network the returned actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G in interactions is 200.0.10.2 such as if the System Manager module and or the Communication Manager module S has previously selected that substrate network address to represent computing node G from the substrate network address range associated with Communication Manager module S thus a communication sent over the substrate network to 200.0.10.2 will be routed to Communication Manager module S for handling. Alternatively if the substrate network were an IPv6 network the returned IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G in interactions may be 0B 02 10.0.0.3 where 10.0.0.3 is stored in the last 32 bits of the 128 bit IPv6 address and where is a 24 bit entity network identifier for computing node G corresponding to the managed virtual computer network for entity Z e.g. as previously assigned by the System Manager module to that network to reflect a random number or some other number corresponding to the entity . In this example the initial 72 bits of the IPv6 network address store the 0B 02 designation corresponding to the sub network or other portion of the physical substrate network with a network address range of 0B 02 72 to which Communication Manager module S corresponds thus a communication sent over the substrate network to IPv6 destination network address 0B 02 10.0.0.3 would similarly be routed to Communication Manager module S for handling. In other embodiments the entity network identifier may be other lengths e.g. 32 bits if Communication Manager module S has an associated network address range of 64 bits rather than 56 bits and or may have other forms e.g. may be random may store various types of information etc. and the remaining 56 bits used for the network address range after the 0B 02 designation may store other types of information e.g. an identifier for a particular entity a tag or label for the virtual computer network an identifier for a particular specified VLAN to which computing node G is assigned etc. . In addition some or all such information may instead be stored and or transmitted with a communication to computing node G in other manners in other embodiments such as by including the information in a header of the communication including in situations in which the substrate network uses the IPv4 networking protocol.

After receiving the response message from Communication Manager module R computing node A creates and initiates the sending of a communication to computing node G shown in as communication . In particular the header of communication includes a destination network address for destination computing node G that is 10.0.0.3 a destination hardware address for destination computing node G that is the virtual hardware address provided to computing node A in message a source network address for sending computing node A that is 10.0.0.2 and a source hardware address for sending computing node A that is an actual or dummy hardware address that was previously identified to computing node A e.g. by Communication Manager module R based on a configuration of computing node A etc. . Since computing node A believes that computing node G is part of the same local sub network as itself computing node A does not need to direct the communication to any intermediate logical router devices that are configured in a network topology for the managed virtual computer network to separate the computing nodes.

Communication Manager module R intercepts the communication modifies the communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication over the substrate network to computing node G. In particular Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual destination network address and virtual destination hardware address for computing node G from the header and then retrieves the actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual destination hardware address from mapping information . As previously noted the actual physical substrate network address is 200.0.10.2 in this example and Communication Manager module R creates a new IPv4 header for the encoded new communication or a new IPv6 header if the substrate network were instead an IPv6 network that includes that actual physical substrate network address as the destination address. Similarly the Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual source network address and virtual source hardware address for computing node A from the header of the received communication obtains an actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual source hardware address e.g. from a stored entry in mapping information by interacting with the System Manager module to obtain that information if not previously obtained etc. which in this example is 200.0.0.1 and includes that actual physical substrate network address as the source network address for the new header of the new encoded communication. The actual physical substrate network address for computing node A if used in a reply by Communication Manager module S on behalf of computing node G will similarly be routed to Communication Manager module R for forwarding to computing node A. The Communication Manager module R next creates communication by modifying communication so as to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new header e.g. in accordance with SIIT including populating the new header with other information as appropriate for the encoded modified communication e.g. payload length traffic class packet priority etc. . Thus the communication includes the same content or payload as communication without encapsulating the communication within the communication in this example. Furthermore access to the specific information within the payload is not needed for such reheadering such as to allow Communication Manager module R to handle communications in which the payload is encrypted without needing to decrypt that payload.

In at least some embodiments before forwarding communication to Communication Manager module S Communication Manager module R may perform one or more actions to determine that communication is authorized to be forwarded to computing node G as communication such as based on the mapping information including a valid entry for the destination virtual hardware address used in communication e.g. an entry specific to sending computing node in some embodiments or instead an entry corresponding to any of the computing nodes in other embodiments . In other embodiments such an authorization determination may not be performed by Communication Manager module R for each outgoing communication or instead may be performed in other manners e.g. based on a determination that the sending node and destination node are part of the same managed virtual computer network are associated with the same entity or are otherwise authorized to inter communicate based on an interaction with System Manager module to obtain an authorization determination for the communication etc. .

After Communication Manager module R forwards the modified communication to the substrate network the substrate network uses the physical destination substrate network address of the encoded communication to route the communication to Communication Manager module S. In doing so the devices of the substrate network do not use information about the overlay virtual network addresses for computing nodes A or G or the entity network identifier for their virtual computer network and thus do not need any special configuration to forward such a communication nor even awareness that a managed virtual computer network is being overlaid on the physical substrate network.

When Communication Manager module S receives communication via the substrate network it performs actions similar to those of Communication Manager module R but in reverse. In particular in at least some embodiments the Communication Manager module S verifies that communication is legitimate and authorized to be forwarded to computing node G such as via one or more interactions with the System Manager module. If the communication is determined to be authorized or if the authorization determination is not performed the Communication Manager module S then modifies communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication to computing node G. Additional details related to the verification of the communication are discussed with respect to .

In particular to modify communication Communication Manager module S retrieves information from mapping information that corresponds to computing node G including the virtual hardware address used by computing node G or generates such a virtual hardware address if not previously available such as for a new computing node . Communication Manager module S then creates communication by modifying communication so as to replace the prior header of the communication encoded for the substrate network with a new IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network e.g. in accordance with SIIT . The new IPv4 header includes the virtual network address and virtual hardware address for computing node G as the destination network address and destination hardware address for the new IPv4 header the virtual network address and a virtual hardware address for computing node A as the source network address and source hardware address for the new IPv4 header and includes other information as appropriate for the communication e.g. total length header checksum etc. . The virtual hardware address used by Communication Manager module S for computing node A may be the same as the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node A but in other embodiments each Communication Manager module may maintain separate hardware address information that is not related to the information used by the other Communication Manager modules e.g. if Communication Manager module S generated its own dummy virtual hardware address for computing node A in response to a prior ARP request from one of the computing nodes for computing node A s hardware address . Thus the communication includes the same content or payload as communications and . Communication Manager module S then provides communication to computing node G.

After receiving communication computing node G determines to send a response communication to computing node A using the source virtual network address and source virtual hardware address for computing node A from communication . Communication Manager module S receives response communication and processes it in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication and Communication Manager module R. In particular Communication Manager module S optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A e.g. based on being a response to a previous communication or otherwise based on configuration information for computing nodes A and G as previously described and then modifies communication to create communication by generating a new substrate network communication header using mapping information . After forwarding communication to the substrate network the communication is sent to Communication Manager module R which processes the incoming communication in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication and Communication Manager module S. In particular Communication Manager module R optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A and that communication actually was sent from the substrate network location of computing node G and then modifies communication to create response communication by generating a new IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network using mapping information . Communication Manager module R then provides response communication to computing node A. In some embodiments and situations Communication Manager modules R and or S may handle response communications differently from initial communications such as to assume that response communications are authorized in at least some situations and to not perform some or all authorization activities for response communications in those situations.

In this manner computing nodes A and G may inter communicate using a IPv4 based managed virtual computer network without any special configuration of those computing nodes to handle the actual intervening one or more substrate networks and substrate network may forward communications encoded for it without any special configuration of any physical networking devices of the substrate network based on the Communication Manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network over the actual physical substrate network.

In addition while not illustrated with respect to in at least some embodiments the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes. For example Communication Manager modules may take various actions to support broadcast and multicast capabilities for computing nodes that they manage including to optionally use various special reserved multicast group virtual network addresses and or to use corresponding policies associated with particular virtual network addresses. When a computing node sends a communication to a virtual network address that is configured to be treated as a broadcast multicast communication any Communication Manager module with an associated computing node that has subscribed to that multicast broadcast would be identified e.g. based on those Communication Manager modules having subscribed to a corresponding broadcast multicast group for that virtual network address such as in response to prior join communications sent by those associated computing nodes and the Communication Manager module for the sending computing node would forward the communication to each of the identified Communication Manager modules of the group for forwarding to their appropriate managed computing nodes. In addition in some embodiments and situations at least some broadcast or multicast communications may not be forwarded by Communication Manager modules such as communications with an IPv4 prefix of 224.0 16 or another designated prefix or other label or identifier. In addition to supporting broadcast and multicast capabilities for managed computing nodes the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes that correspond to configured network topologies for the virtual computer networks to which the computing nodes belong. For example computing nodes may send various requests that a specified local router device or other specified networking device would be expected to handle e.g. ping requests SNMP queries etc. and the associated Communication Manager modules may intercept such requests and take various corresponding actions to emulate the functionality that would have been provided by the specified networking device if it was physically implemented.

In addition it will be appreciated that a Communication Manager module may facilitate communications between multiple of the computing nodes that are associated with that Communication Manager module. For example with respect to computing node may wish to send an additional communication not shown to computing node . If so Communication Manager module R would perform actions similar to those previously described with respect to the handling of outgoing communication by Communication Manager module R and the handling of incoming communication by Communication Manager module S but without reheadering of the additional communication to use an header for the substrate network since the communication will not travel over the substrate network. However if computing nodes and are configured in a network topology for the virtual computer network to be separated by one or more logical networking devices the Communication Manager module R may take additional actions to emulate the functionality of those logical networking devices.

While not illustrated with respect to in at least some embodiments other types of requests and communications may also be handled in various ways. For example in at least some embodiments an entity may have one or more computing nodes that are managed by Communication Manager module s and that are part of a managed virtual computer network for that entity and may further have one or more other non managed computing systems e.g. computing systems that are directly connected to the substrate network and or that natively use the same network addressing protocol as that of the substrate network that do not have an associated Communication Manager module that manages their communications. If the entity desires that those non managed computing systems be part of that virtual computer network or otherwise communicate with the managed computing nodes of the virtual computer network such communications between managed computing nodes and non managed computing systems may be handled by the Communication Manager module s that manage the one or more computing nodes in at least some such embodiments. For example in such situations if such a non managed computing system is provided with an actual destination substrate network address for such a managed computing node the non managed computing system may send communications to the associated Communication Manager module for that managed computing node via substrate network using that destination substrate network address and that Communication Manager module would forward those communications to that computing node e.g. after reheadering the communications in a manner similar to that previously described if the Communication Manager module is configured to accept communications from that non managed computing system or from any non managed computing system . Furthermore the Communication Manager module may generate a dummy virtual network address to correspond to such a non managed computing system map it to the actual substrate network address for the non managed computing system and provide the dummy virtual network address to its managed computing node e.g. as the source address for the communications forwarded to the computing node from the non managed computing system thus allowing the computing node to send communications to the non managed computing system.

In addition as previously noted a communication manager module manages communications for associated computing nodes in various ways including in some embodiments by assigning virtual network addresses to computing nodes of a provided virtual computer network and or by assigning substrate physical network addresses to managed computing nodes from a range of substrate physical network addresses that correspond to the communication manager module. In other embodiments some such activities may instead be performed by one or more computing nodes of the virtual computer network such as to allow a DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server or other device of a virtual computer network to specify virtual network addresses for particular computing nodes of the virtual network. In such embodiments the communication manager module obtains such configuration information from the virtual computer network device s and updates its mapping information accordingly and in some embodiments may further update one or more system manager modules that maintain information about computing nodes associated with virtual networks . In yet other embodiments a user or other entity associated with a virtual computer network may directly configure particular computing nodes to use particular virtual network addresses. If so the communication manager modules and or system manager module may track which virtual network addresses are used by particular computing nodes and similarly update stored mapping information accordingly.

After the System Manager module determines that computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G e.g. based on having the same entity network identifier based on computing node A having an entity network identifier that is authorized to communicate with computing nodes of the entity network identifier for computing node G based on other information provided by or associated with computing node A indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications based on information provided by or associated with computing node G indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications etc. the System Manager module returns a response message that includes the desired actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G. In addition in at least some embodiments before sending the desired actual physical network address the System Manager module may further verify that Communication Manager module R is authorized to send the message on behalf of computing node A such as based on computing node A being determined to be one of the computing nodes to which Communication Manager module R is associated.

In other embodiments Communication Manager module R may perform some or all of the actions described as being performed by System Manager module such as to maintain provisioning information for the various computing nodes and or to determine whether computing node A is authorized to send communications to computing node G or instead no such authorization determination may be performed in some or all situations. Furthermore in other embodiments other types of authorization determinations may be performed for a communication between two or more computing nodes such as based on one or more criteria associated with the communication e.g. a type of the communication a size of the communication a time of the communication etc. and or based on one or more policies associated with the virtual network addresses used by the source and or destination computing nodes.

As previously noted with respect to after Communication Manager module S receives communication intended for computing node G via the substrate network Communication Manager module S may perform one or more interactions with the System Manager module in order to determine whether to authorize that communication. In particular in this example to verify that the communication is valid and authorized to be forwarded to computing node G Communication Manager module S first extracts information from the encoded communication that indicates the overlay virtual computer network source and destination virtual network addresses for computing nodes A and G and optionally the entity network identifier s for those computing nodes e.g. from header fields in the encoded communication or by extracting embedded information in the actual destination substrate network address and actual source substrate network address of the encoded communication . The Communication Manager module S next exchanges messages with System Manager module to obtain the corresponding actual substrate physical network address for the sending computing node A on behalf of computing node G including a message that includes the extracted virtual network addresses for computing nodes A and G in the overlay virtual computer network as well as the entity network identifier for each of the computing nodes. In at least some embodiments Communication Manager module S may send message to the System Manager module using an anycast addressing and routing scheme as previously described.

The System Manager module receives message and returns a response message that includes the actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node A e.g. 200.0.0.1 . As previously discussed with respect to messages and in some embodiments the System Manager module and or Communication Manager module S may further perform one or more other types of authorization determination activities such as to determine that computing node G is authorized to communicate with computing node A that Communication Manager module S is authorized to send the message on behalf of computing node G etc. Communication Manager module S then verifies that the returned physical substrate network address in response message matches the source substrate network address used to send the encoded communication over the substrate network so as to prevent attempts to spoof messages as being from computing node A that are actually sent from other computing nodes in other locations. Communication Manager module S optionally stores this received information from response message as part of an entry for computing node A in mapping information for later use along with computing node A s virtual network address and a virtual hardware address for computing node A.

In the example of computing node A is sending a communication to computing node G in a manner similar to that of the communication sent from computing node A to computing node G in . As in computing nodes A and G are configured to belong to a single logical subnet of the virtual computer network as discussed in greater detail with respect to and with computing node H being configured to act as a firewall device for communications passing between those logical subnets. The actions of the physically implemented modules and and devices of network in actually sending the communication are shown.

Thus in a manner similar to that described with respect to computing node A determines to send a communication to computing node G and accordingly exchanges various messages with Communication Manager module R . In particular in this example computing node A first sends a message request for virtual hardware address information for computing node G but in this case uses the target network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G rather than the virtual network address used in . Communication Manager module R intercepts the request and obtains a hardware address to provide to computing node A as part of spoofed response message for use in directing the inter node communication along the configured routing path to the destination computing node in a manner similar to that previously discussed. In particular the Communication Manager module R may store various hardware address information as part of mapping information as discussed in greater detail with respect to and if so may already have stored hardware address information for use with communications from computing node A to computing node G. If not however Communication Manager module R performs one or more interactions with the System Manager module to obtain information from the module corresponding to the indicated target network node moniker for computing node G. The Communication Manager module R then stores the received information as part of mapping information for future use with the hardware address for computing node G being associated with the substrate network address for computing node G at least for communications sent from computing node A of 200.0.10.2 and computing node G s network node moniker and provides computing node A with the hardware address corresponding to computing node G as part of response message 

After receiving the response message from Communication Manager module R computing node A creates and initiates the sending of a communication to computing node G shown in as communication . In particular the header of communication includes a destination network node moniker for destination computing node G that is DeptA ClientB a destination hardware address that is the virtual hardware address for computing node G provided to computing node A in message a source network node moniker for sending computing node A that is EastEmailServer and a source hardware address for sending computing node A that is an actual or dummy hardware address that was previously identified to computing node A.

The outgoing communication is intercepted and handled by Communication Manager module R in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to . In particular as with communication in Communication Manager module R intercepts the communication modifies the communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication over the substrate network to computing node G. To determine the substrate network address to be used for forwarding the modified communication over the substrate network Communication Manager module R extracts the destination network node moniker and destination virtual hardware address from the header of communication . After Communication Manager module R determines the actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G it creates a new substrate network communication header that includes that actual physical substrate network address as the destination address and similarly adds a source substrate network address for computing node A to the new header in this example using 200.0.10.2 for the destination address and 200.0.0.1 for the source address . The Communication Manager module R next creates a new communication by modifying communication so as to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new header e.g. in accordance with SIIT including populating the new header with other information as appropriate for the new communication e.g. payload length traffic class packet priority etc. and forwards communication over the substrate network . As discussed in greater detail with respect to in response to the request message and or communication the Communication Manager module R and or the System Manager module may further perform various optional authentication activities.

The substrate network then uses the destination substrate network address of the communication to route the communication to Communication Manager module S. When Communication Manager module S receives communication via the substrate network it performs actions similar to those described in with respect to communication including to optionally perform interactions with the System Manager module to determine if the communication is authorized to update mapping information to reflect any new information about computing node A to modify the communication to include an appropriate IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network of entity Z and to provide the modified communication as communication to computing node G. In particular the modified communication will include a destination network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G and a source network node moniker of EastEmailServer for computing node A.

In addition computing node G may determine to send a response communication back to computing node A in a manner similar to that discussed in Figure A. In this response communication from computing node G includes a source network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G and a destination network node moniker of EastEmailServer for computing node A. Response communication is intercepted and handled by Communication Manager module S in a manner similar to that previously discussed in including to modify the communication as appropriate for the substrate network and to forward the modified communication over the substrate network to computing node A as communication e.g. by modifying communication to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new substrate communication header such as in accordance with SIIT including to use a destination substrate network address of 200.0.0.1 a source substrate network address of 200.0.10.2 and to populate the new header with other information as appropriate for the new communication such as payload length traffic class packet priority etc. . The substrate network then uses the destination substrate network address of the communication to route the communication to Communication Manager module R. When Communication Manager module R receives communication via the substrate network it performs actions similar to those previously described with respect to including to optionally determine if the communication is authorized to modify the communication to include an appropriate IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network of entity Z including to again use a source network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G and a destination network node moniker of EastEmailServer for computing node A and to provide the modified communication as communication to computing node A.

While not illustrated in computing node A may further decide to send another communication to computing node C and send a similar message to that of request by specifying computing node C s network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus . However this other communication to computing node C would be handled differently from the prior communication to computing node G. In particular such communications between computing nodes A and C would be configured to first pass through initial intermediate computing node H before being forwarded to its final destination since computing nodes A and C are part of separate logical subnets in the specified network topology for the managed virtual computer network. Accordingly the information maintained by the System Manager module for use in directing communications from computing node A to computing node C reflects that computing node H is an initial intermediate destination for such communications. Thus in response to an interaction from Communication Manager module R analogous to that of in which the substrate network address corresponding to network node moniker sub2 Prometheus is requested by computing node A the System Manager module indicates that computing node C s network node moniker corresponds to the substrate network address of 200.0.10.3 for computing node H at least for communications sent from computing node A as part of the substrate network routing path from computing node A to computing node C.

Thus when computing node A later sends a communication to computing node C by using a destination network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus and a corresponding destination virtual hardware address received from Communication Manager module R Communication Manager module R intercepts this communication modifies the communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication over the substrate network to computing node H. In particular to determine the substrate network address to be used for forwarding the modified communication over the substrate network Communication Manager module R extracts the destination network node moniker and destination virtual hardware address from the header of the communication and creates a new substrate network communication header that includes that actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node H as the destination address for the new communication header and similarly adds a source substrate network address for computing node A to the new header. The substrate network then would forward the communication to Communication Manager module S which manages computing node H in this example which would perform similar activities to those previously discussed including to determine if the communication is authorized to update mapping information to reflect any new information about computing node A to modify the communication to include an appropriate IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network of entity Z and to provide the modified communication to computing node H. However the communication that is provided to computing node H using its interface logical subnet to which computing node A belongs would include information that indicates that computing node C is the final destination for the communication such as for use by computing node H in performing its firewall analysis in particular in this example the substrate network communication includes a destination hardware address that corresponds to computing node H but has a destination network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus for computing node C.

When computing node H receives the communication it optionally performs various firewall related activities for the communication based on its configuration and may determine to forward the communication on to its final destination of computing node C. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere such intermediate computing nodes via which some inter node communications may be directed may provide a variety of other types of capabilities in other embodiments and situations. Furthermore as noted elsewhere computing node H may in some such situations determine to modify the communication in one or more manners based on its firewall policies. In order to forward the communication on to computing node C computing node H updates the received communication so that it has a new destination hardware address that corresponds to computing node C optionally after performing interactions with Communication Manager module S to obtain the hardware address for computing node C s network node moniker in a manner similar to that of communications and in and continues to use the destination network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus for computing node C. The computing node H then sends the modified communication out using its logical network interface for logical subnet to which computing node C belongs.

Communication Manager module S would intercept this communication from computing node H modify the communication as appropriate for the substrate network and forward the modified communication over the substrate network to computing node C. In particular to determine the substrate network address to be used for forwarding the modified communication over the substrate network Communication Manager module S extracts the destination network node moniker and destination virtual hardware address from the header of the communication and creates a new substrate network communication header that includes that actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node C as the destination address for the new communication header. The substrate network then would forward the communication to Communication Manager module R which manages computing node C in this example which would perform similar activities to those previously discussed including to determine if the communication is authorized to update mapping information to modify the communication to include an appropriate IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network of entity Z and to provide the modified communication to computing node C. The communication that is provided to computing node C would include information that indicates that computing node C is the destination network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus for computing node C and the source network node moniker of EastEmailServer for computing node A.

In this manner the CNS system may provide functionality corresponding to the use of network node monikers by the virtual computer network including in accordance with a specified network topology from the virtual computer network without any special configuration of the substrate network physical networking devices based on the Communication Manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network on the actual substrate network in such a manner as to provide the desired functionality. Various other types of actions than those discussed with respect to may be performed in other embodiments including for types of network addressing protocols other than IPv4 and or IPv6.

As previously noted illustrates additional information related to a specified network topology for the managed overlay virtual computer network of . In particular the overlay virtual computer network is illustrated in as including two distinct logical subnets logical subnet and logical subnet . Logical subnet includes computing nodes A and G as well as optionally including other computing nodes of entity Z s virtual computer network that were not illustrated in . Logical subnet includes computing node C as well as optionally including other computing nodes and or of entity Z s virtual computer network that were not illustrated in . In addition the logical network topology of the overlay virtual computer network includes computing node H being configured to operate as an intermediate destination between the two logical subnets and in particular to provide firewall capabilities in this example. Computing node H is configured to have two logical network interfaces in this example including a first logical network interface H that corresponds to logical subnet and has an associated network node moniker of firewall 1 and a second logical network interface H that corresponds to logical subnet and has an associated network node moniker of firewall 2 . It will be appreciated that configured network topologies may be more complex in other embodiments and situations including in some situations to have a chain of multiple intermediate destinations through which at least some communications are forwarded and that such intermediate nodes may perform other types of actions in some situations.

Furthermore the network node monikers that are used may provide meaningful information to entity Z as well as optionally including special character sequences that trigger specialized handling by the configurable network service. For example with respect to the software firewall computing node H the network node monikers for its interfaces begin with firewall thus providing information about the functionality corresponding to the computing node associated with those network node monikers and conclude with the numbers 1 and 2 such as to represent the logical subnet in the specified network topology to which the interfaces correspond. In addition some or all of the computing nodes that are part of logical subnet may have network node monikers beginning with sub2 thus providing information about their respective network topology locations. Furthermore if such a convention were enforced for those computing nodes the sub2 character sequence at the beginning of a network node moniker could further trigger specialized behavior such as to enable the mapping information of a communication manager module to direct communications from any computing node in logical subnet that are directed to a network node moniker of sub2 with representing a wildcard match to the substrate network address for network node moniker firewall 1 rather than having individual entries for each such computing node in logical subnet . The network node moniker of EastEmailServer for computing node A further indicates both geographical location and functional information for the corresponding computing node in this example and the network node moniker of DeptA ClientB could be used to indicate an organizational affiliation e.g. that the computing node is part of Department A of an organization to which entity Z corresponds such as if a convention is enforced that all computing nodes in that department have network node monikers that being with the character sequence of DeptA . It will be appreciated that these examples are provided for illustrative purposes and that a wide range of other naming conventions may be used in other embodiments including to allow particular clients to specify their own individual naming conventions in at least some such embodiments.

In particular in this example mapping information used by the Communication Manager module R in includes information for each entry that includes the following a virtual computer network identifier which in this example is a network identifier corresponding to the overlay virtual computer network provided for entity Z a source node interface identifier which in this example includes an A to correspond to the single logical network interface for computing node A and a C to correspond to the single logical network interface for computing node C a destination network node moniker identifier an associated destination substrate network address and optionally various other information . The optional other information may include for example a destination hardware address provided to associated computing nodes for use in representing particular destination computing nodes information about expiration times or other use criteria for particular entries etc.

Thus in the example of when computing node A initiates the sending of a communication to computing node G in the sent communication includes the destination network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G. In this example the entry provides the best match for the indicated destination virtual network address such as based on the use of longest prefix matching to select the entry that matches the destination network node moniker and has the longest number of matching characters that are specified. The substrate network address for entry in this example is 200.0.10.2 corresponding to computing node G to which the communication will be directed. Thus entry will be used for communications sent from computing node A to computing node G. Other matching and mapping techniques may be optionally employed rather than longest prefix matching in some embodiments such as by first attempting to find an exact one to one match in the mapping information and then employing longest prefix matching if an exact match cannot be found. Different criteria may also be used in particular situations and embodiments to determine whether to attempt to use one to one matching longest prefix matching or a combination of the two approaches e.g. determining whether to find a one to one match first or employ longest prefix matching first . This criteria may be based on the source or destination of the communication e.g. when the source is a computing node of the virtual computer network and the destination is an external network or node the network traffic volume of communication going to or coming from a particular external node or network the number of virtual network addresses associated with a particular external network etc.

If computing node A of decided to send an additional communication to computing node C other entries and or in mapping information may instead be used. In particular if computing node A initiates the sending of such an additional communication to computing node C the additional communication would be routed via the intermediate destination of computing node H since computing nodes A and C are part of separate logical subnets as discussed in greater detail with respect to . Thus the sent additional communication would include the destination network node moniker of sub2 Prometheus for computing node C. In this example assuming that optional entry is not present the entry provides the best match for the indicated destination virtual network address such as based on the use of longest prefix matching to select the entry that matches the destination network address and has the longest number of matching characters that are specified. The substrate network address for entry in this example is 200.0.10.3 corresponding to intermediate destination computing node H to which the communication will be initially directed. Thus entry will be used for communications sent from computing node A to computing node C and more generally to any computing node of logical subnet B that has a network node moniker beginning with sub2 such as computing node J not shown in . While the hierarchical network node monikers in this example include only two levels of hierarchy i.e. an upper sub2 level and a lower level that is specific to the particular computing node in other embodiments such hierarchical network node monikers may have numerous levels. In addition while not illustrated here various textual network node moniker information could also be used in other manners in other embodiments including to automatically grant permissions and or impose restrictions on computing nodes based on their network node monikers including based on hierarchical information in their network node monikers e.g. to grant a first specified type of permission to all computing nodes whose network node monikers begin with sub2 or alternatively are otherwise part of a sub2 hierarchical level based on organizational information in their network node monikers e.g. to grant a second specified type of permission to all computing nodes whose network node monikers include DeptA based on geographical information in network node monikers e.g. to grant a third specified type of permission to all computing nodes whose network node monikers begin with or alternatively include East etc.

In addition it is further possible to configure more specific functionality with respect to particular computing nodes in some embodiments. For example if communications from computing node A to computing node C are specifically configured to pass through computing node H without the normal firewall handling that it would provide thus effectively skipping computing node H as an intermediate destination the mapping information may further optionally include the entry for source computing node A and destination computing node C. If so the example communication discussed above would instead cause the entry to be selected resulting in a substrate network address for computing node C of 200.0.0.3 being selected for use with the outgoing additional communication. Moreover since Communication Manager module R manages both computing nodes A and C in that example the outgoing communication would be forwarded to computing node C by Communication Manager module R without the communication ever being sent over the substrate network .

The example mapping information includes information similar to that displayed for mapping information and in particular includes information for each of its entries that includes the following a virtual computer network identifier which in this example is a network identifier corresponding to the overlay virtual computer network provided for entity Z a source computing node interface identifier a destination network node moniker identifier an associated destination substrate network address and optionally various other information . The example mapping information illustrates that different logical network interfaces of a computing node may be configured to have different routing information with the illustrated entries including information for both of the example logical network interfaces of computing node H with the logical identifier H in column corresponding to the logical network interface H of and with the logical identifier H in column corresponding to the logical network interface H of . For example communications received on logical network interface H of computing node H from logical subnet may validly have final destinations that are on logical subnet A such as computing node A with network node moniker EastEmailServer and computing node G with network node moniker DeptA ClientB while communications received on logical network interface H of computing node H from logical subnet may be configured to not validly have final destinations that are also on logical subnet . Accordingly in this example an entry is included to indicate that any communication received on logical network interface H with a destination network node moniker of DeptA ClientB for computing node G on logical subnet will generate an error although in other embodiments such invalid entries may instead be represented without such explicit invalid entries e.g. by not including any valid entries that do match such destination network node monikers . It will be appreciated that such mapping information and C may have various other forms and be represented in other manners in other embodiments.

In this manner the CNS system may provide functionality that supports the use of network node monikers within a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network without any special configuration of the physical networking devices of the substrate network or of the devices external to the substrate network based on communication manager modules and edge modules overlaying the virtual computer network on the actual physical substrate network in such a manner as to provide the desired functionality including to support the routing of communications directed to network node monikers at a layer 3 network layer level.

Various other types of actions than those discussed with respect to may be performed in other embodiments including for types of network addressing protocols other than IPv4 and or IPv6 and for network node monikers having other forms than those illustrated.

In some embodiments one or more modules of the configurable network service may further be configured to perform one or more additional types of functionality in at least some situations such as by the multiple communication manager modules optionally in a distributed manner and or by the system manager module. As one example the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to perform metering or other tracking of the use of one or more network node monikers for a managed virtual computer network and to provide information about such tracking for various purposes e.g. to enable fees to be charged to a client associated with the managed virtual computer network if the corresponding tracked activities are fee based activities to provide information to a client associated with the managed virtual computer network and or to another entity regarding an amount of use of one or more network node monikers such as to enable corresponding monitoring activities etc. . As another example the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to filter at least some communications forwarded to and or from one or more network node monikers of a managed virtual computer network such as based on one or more associated policies including to limit the rate or total quantity of such communications to be below a specified or determined threshold of use such rate quantity limiting or other filtering may be configured in various manners such as based on configuration information received by a client associated with the managed virtual computer network e.g. to limit use of a fee based feature of the managed virtual computer network to correspond to limitations of associated computing nodes or networking components etc. based on a capacity or other aspects of a particular associated computing node etc. In addition the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to perform signaling activities if the unavailability of a computing node associated with a particular network node moniker is detected e.g. based on the computing node failing or on a connection to the computing node being unavailable and as may be detected based on a lack of response or other information from the computing node for a period of time or to one or more forwarded communications or other messages such as to facilitate the use of new or existing if any alternative computing nodes associated with the network node moniker to notify other computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network of the unavailability to inhibit future communications from being forwarded to the network node moniker while it is unavailable to optionally perform other related activities e.g. to initiate providing a replacement for the unavailable computing node etc.

In addition in some situations a communication manager module tracks or otherwise determines the virtual computer networks to which the module s associated computing nodes belong e.g. based on entities on whose behalf the virtual computer networks operate as part of managing the communications for the virtual computer networks and an edge module may similarly track or otherwise determines the one or more virtual computer networks to which the module s associated external nodes belong as part of managing the communications sent to and or from those external nodes. The determination by a communication manager module of a corresponding virtual computer network for an associated computing node and or the determination by a edge module of a corresponding virtual computer network for an associated external node may be performed in various ways in various embodiments such as by interacting with a system manager module that provides that information by tracking software modules or other programs executing on such computing nodes by tracking entities associated with such computing nodes based on communications sent by and or to the nodes etc. For example when a particular computing node begins to execute one or more software programs on behalf of a user and that user also has other software programs executing on other computing nodes the new computing node executing the user s program s may be selected to be associated with a virtual computer network for the user that includes those other computing nodes. Alternatively a user or other entity may specify a particular managed computer network to which a computing node belongs such as if the entity maintains multiple distinct managed computer networks between different groups of computing nodes. In addition in at least some embodiments one or more system manager modules of the CNS system may facilitate configuring communications between computing nodes and external nodes such as by tracking and or managing which computing nodes and external nodes belong to which virtual computer networks e.g. based on executing programs on behalf of a customer or other entity by tracking and or managing which external nodes operate as logical nodes of which virtual computer networks and by providing information about actual substrate network addresses or actual public external network addresses that correspond to network node monikers and or virtual network addresses used for a particular virtual computer network e.g. by a particular customer or other entity .

In addition as previously noted configuration information that is specified for a virtual computer network may include various network topology information and various computing nodes and external nodes in various locations may be selected for the virtual computer network and configured in accordance with the network topology in various manners. For example in some embodiments the selection of a computing node to be used in a managed virtual computer network and or to be assigned a particular role in a configured network topology may be based at least in part on a geographical and or network location of the computing node such as an absolute location or instead a location relative to one or more other computing resources of interest e.g. other computing nodes of the same managed virtual computer network storage resources to be used by the computing node etc. such as within a minimum and or maximum specified geographical distance or other degree of proximity to an indicated other computing resource or other location. In addition in some embodiments factors used when selecting a computing node may not be based on location such as to include one or more of the following constraints related to capabilities of a computing node such as resource related criteria e.g. an amount of memory an amount of processor usage an amount of network bandwidth and or an amount of disk space and or specialized capabilities available only on a subset of available computing nodes e.g. database services and storage constraints related to costs such as based on fees or operating costs associated with use of particular computing nodes etc.

As previously noted in some embodiments a program execution service executes third party customers programs using multiple physical computing systems e.g. in one or more data centers that each host multiple virtual machines with each virtual machine being able to execute one or more programs for a customer. In some such embodiments customers may provide programs to be executed to the program execution service and may reserve execution time and other resources on physical or virtual hardware facilities provided by the program execution service. In addition customers and or the program execution service may define virtual computer networks that will be used by the program execution service for computing nodes or external nodes of the customer so as to transparently provide computing nodes of a virtual computer network including nodes located remote from the substrate network with the appearance of operating on a dedicated physical network.

The computing system in this example operates to configure and manage virtual computer networks within the group as well as to provide other functions e.g. the provisioning initialization and execution of programs on computing nodes . The computing system includes one or more CPU central processing unit processors various I O input output components storage and memory . The I O components include a display network connection computer readable media drive and other I O devices e.g. a mouse keyboard speakers etc. .

The host computing system operates to host one or more virtual machines such as for use as computing nodes in managed virtual computer networks e.g. computing nodes that execute programs on behalf of various users . The host computing system includes one or more CPU processors various I O components storage and memory . While not illustrated here the I O components may include similar components to those of I O components . A virtual machine Communication Manager module and one or more virtual machines are executing in the memory with the module managing communications for the associated virtual machine computing nodes and in some embodiments including various software instructions that when executed program one or more of the CPU processors to provide the described functionality. The Communication Manager module maintains various mapping information on storage related to the computing nodes and other computing nodes such as in a manner similar to mapping information and of . The structure of the other host computing systems may be similar to that of host computing system or instead some or all of the host computing systems and may act directly as computing nodes by executing programs without using hosted virtual machines. In a typical arrangement the group may include hundreds or thousands of host computing systems such as those illustrated here organized into a large number of distinct physical sub networks and or networks.

An embodiment of a CNS system is executing in memory of the computing system . In some embodiments the system may receive an indication of multiple computing nodes to be used as part of a managed virtual computer network e.g. one or more virtual machine computing nodes on host computing system or one or more computing nodes using one of the host computing systems and in some situations may select the particular computing node s for the managed virtual computer network. In some cases information about the structure and or membership of various managed virtual computer networks may be stored in the provisioning database on storage by the system and provided to the Communication Manager modules at various times. Similarly in some cases information about configured network topology to be emulated for one or more managed virtual computer networks including information about any integrated external nodes may be stored in the database on storage by the system and used to provide corresponding information to the Communication Manager modules at various times. In addition information about configured network node monikers for one or more managed virtual computer networks including information about any associated policies may be stored in the database on storage by the system such as in a manner similar to information of and used to provide corresponding information to the Communication Manager modules at various times. In this example the system in memory includes a system manager module and optionally other modules with the communication manager modules and being a further part of the distributed CNS system in this example. The CNS system and the modules and may each in some embodiments include various software instructions that when executed program one or more of the CPU processors to provide described functionality.

As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the Communication Manager modules and and other Communication Manager modules not shown that manage other associated computing nodes not shown and the various modules and of the system may interact in various ways to manage communications between computing nodes including to support the use of network node monikers for one or more managed virtual computer networks being provided by the CNS system . Such interactions may for example enable the computing nodes and or other computing nodes to inter communicate over managed virtual computer networks using such network node monikers by overlaying the virtual computer networks over network and optionally one or more external networks not shown without any special configuration of networking device or other networking devices not shown and without encapsulation of communications.

It will be appreciated that computing systems and edge devices and networking device are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. For example computing systems and or may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated including through one or more networks external to the group such as the Internet or via the World Wide Web Web . More generally a computing node or other computing system may comprise any combination of hardware or software that can interact and perform the described types of functionality including without limitation desktop or other fixed location computers laptops and tablets and other mobile computers database servers network storage devices and other network devices PDAs smart phones and other cell phones wireless phones pagers electronic organizers Internet appliances television based systems e.g. using set top boxes and or personal digital video recorders and various other consumer products that include appropriate communication capabilities. In addition the functionality provided by the illustrated modules may in some embodiments be combined in fewer modules or distributed in additional modules such as if the functionality of a system manager module and one or more communication manager modules are instead combined into a single module. Similarly in some embodiments the functionality of some of the illustrated modules may not be provided and or other additional functionality may be available.

It will also be appreciated that while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them may be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and or systems may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing systems via inter computer communication. Furthermore in some embodiments some or all of the systems and or modules may be implemented or provided in other manners such as by using means that are implemented at least partially or completely in firmware and or hardware including but not limited to one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs standard integrated circuits controllers e.g. by executing appropriate instructions and including microcontrollers and or embedded controllers field programmable gate arrays FPGAs complex programmable logic devices CPLDs etc. Some or all of the modules systems and data structures may also be stored e.g. as software instructions or structured data on a non transitory computer readable storage medium such as a hard disk or flash drive or other non volatile storage device volatile or non volatile memory e.g. RAM a network storage device or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive e.g. a DVD disk a CD disk an optical disk etc. or via an appropriate connection. The systems modules and data structures may also in some embodiments be transmitted as generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums and may take a variety of forms e.g. as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames . Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where a request is received. The routine continues to block to determine the type of request. If it is determined that the type of request is to associate one or more computing nodes and or external nodes with a particular managed virtual computer network provided for an indicated entity such as if those nodes are executing or are to execute one or more programs on behalf of that entity or are otherwise designed or configured to provide one or more desired types of functionality for that entity the routine continues to block to associate those nodes with that indicated entity and virtual computer network. In some embodiments the routine may further determine one or more computing nodes to be associated with the indicated entity and virtual computer network such as based on information provided by the indicated entity while in other embodiments the selection of such computing nodes and or execution of appropriate programs on those computing nodes may be performed in other ways. In addition as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments one or more of the computing nodes may each be a virtual machine that is hosted by one or more physical computing systems and any external nodes may have various forms in various embodiments and situations. In addition in some embodiments the routine may obtain and store various types of configuration information for the virtual computer network such as one or more network node monikers and or a range of virtual network addresses for use with the virtual computer network a specified network topology for the virtual computer network one or more policies associated with particular network node monikers and or virtual network addresses etc. The routine then continues to block to store mapping information for the nodes and the managed virtual computer network including any received configuration information. For example in the illustrated embodiment the routine stores for each computing node and each group of one or more external nodes an indication of a corresponding substrate network address one or more network node monikers and or virtual network addresses for the virtual computer network and optionally other information e.g. a corresponding virtual hardware address an indication of the associated entity information about a logical location and or function of the node in the specified network topology an indication of any associated policies based on the associated one or more network node monikers and or virtual network addresses etc. . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the substrate network address or external network address corresponding to a node may in some embodiments be a network address specific to that single node while in other embodiments may instead refer to a sub network or other group of multiple nodes such as may be managed by an associated Communication Manager module and or edge module. After block the routine continues to block to optionally provide information about the node s and their configuration to one or more communication manager modules and or one or more edge modules associated with those nodes although in other embodiments instead provides such information upon request from the communication manager modules and or edge modules.

If it is instead determined in block that the type of received request is a request for resolution for a network node moniker or virtual network address of a target node or other computer system of interest such as from a communication manager module or edge module on behalf of a managed node the routine continues instead to block in other embodiments however such resolution requests may not be used by at least computing nodes of managed computer networks for network node monikers and or for virtual network addresses such as if those computing nodes use network node monikers or virtual network addresses without using any other addressing scheme e.g. without using any network addresses or hardware addresses and with an associated communication manager module directly translating a specified network node moniker or virtual network address to a corresponding mapped substrate network address . In the illustrated embodiment the routine in block determines whether the request is authorized in one or more ways such as based on whether the managed node on whose behalf the request is made is authorized to send communications to a target node whose resolution is requested e.g. based on the virtual computer network s to which the two nodes belong based on whether the managed node on whose behalf the request is made is a valid node that is currently part of a configured virtual computer network and or based on whether the request is received from the communication manager module or edge module that actually manages the indicated node on whose behalf the request is made. If the request is determined to be authorized the routine continues to block where it obtains a particular network node moniker or virtual network address of interest to be resolved for a particular target node of interest such as may be included with the request received in block or previously stored and currently identifiable for the target based on other received information. The routine then continues to block to retrieve stored information for the target that is associated with the particular network node moniker or virtual network address and in particular to retrieve information that associates that target network node moniker or virtual network address to one or more substrate network addresses for one or more network locations that correspond to the target e.g. substrate network locations of one or computing nodes to which the target network node moniker or virtual network address is associated such as may be previously stored with respect to block and optionally to also provide other information for the target network node moniker or virtual network address e.g. an associated virtual hardware address an indication regarding whether the target corresponds to a physically implemented computing node with an actual substrate network address or instead to a logical networking device that does not have an actual substrate network address information about a role or status of the device corresponding to the target with respect to configured network topology information whether the target is external to a current location such that communications to the target will use one or more intermediate destination edge devices and or edge modules whether communications to the target will use one or more intermediate computing node destinations or other intermediate destinations that are not edge devices or edge modules information about any associated policies for the target etc. . After block the routine continues to to provide an indication of the retrieved information to the requester. While not illustrated here if the determination in block determines that the request is not authorized the routine may instead not perform blocks for that request such as by responding with an error message to the request received in block or by not responding to that received request. In addition in other embodiments the routine may perform one or more other tests to validate a received request before responding with the requested information such as to verify that the node that initiated the request is authorized to receive that information. Furthermore in the illustrated embodiment communication manager modules perform operations to select particular intermediate destinations to use for particular communications including in some situations a particular computing node when multiple computing nodes are associated with a particular network node moniker or virtual network address e.g. in accordance with an associated policy such as in an individualized manner for each of at least some communications although in other embodiments the routine may instead perform some or all such actions e.g. as part of block and if the same one or more computing nodes are repeatedly used for multiple communications between a source and an indicated final destination network node moniker or virtual network address .

If it is instead determined in block that the received request is of another type the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example in some embodiments the routine may receive requests to update stored information about particular nodes such as if a particular node was previously associated with a particular entity and or virtual computer network but that association ends e.g. one or more programs being executed for that entity on that node are terminated the node fails or otherwise becomes unavailable an associated user or other client changes specified configuration information for the node etc. such as if one or more computing nodes associated with a particular network node moniker and or virtual network address changes etc. and may optionally provide such updated information to one or more communication manager modules of the provided virtual network. Similarly in some embodiments the routine may receive requests to update stored information about external nodes or otherwise about specified network topology for a virtual computer network including to add remove or configure edge modules in some situations and optionally to provide such updated information to one or more communication manager modules of the provided virtual network. The routine may also perform a variety of other actions related to managing a system of multiple nodes as discussed in greater detail elsewhere and may at times perform actions of other types such as to perform occasional housekeeping operations to review and update stored information as appropriate e.g. after predefined periods of time have expired . In addition if possible validation problems are detected such as with respect to received resolution requests for network node monikers or virtual network addresses the routine may take various actions to signal an error and or perform other corresponding actions as appropriate.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

The routine begins at block where an indication is received of a node communication or other message. The routine continues to block to determine the type of communication or other message and proceed accordingly. If it is determined in block that the message is a request from an associated managed computing node for resolution of a network node moniker or virtual network address e.g. an ARP request the routine continues to block in other embodiments however such resolution requests may not be used by at least computing nodes of managed computer networks for network node monikers and or for virtual network addresses such as if those computing nodes use network node monikers or virtual network addresses without using any other addressing scheme e.g. without using any network addresses or hardware addresses and with an associated communication manager module directly translating a specified network node moniker or virtual network address to a corresponding mapped substrate network address . In the illustrated embodiment the routine in block identifies the target network node moniker or virtual network address of interest indicated in the request. The routine then continues to block to send a request to a system manager module for resolution for the identified target for the virtual computer network that is associated with the computing node that provided the request such as discussed with respect to blocks of . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the routine may in some embodiments track information about virtual computer networks and or entities associated with each managed computing node while in other embodiments at least some such information may instead be provided to the routine by the computing nodes and or by the system manager module or instead the system manager module may track and store that information without it being provided to and tracked by the current routine. While not illustrated here in other embodiments and situations such resolution requests may be handled in other manners. For example if a computing node being managed by a particular communication manager module provides a resolution request for another computing node that is also managed by that communication manager module the routine may instead respond to the request without interaction with the system manager module such as based on locally stored information. In addition while in the illustrated embodiment the received request is a request to provide a computing node s link layer hardware address that corresponds to an indicated layer 3 network layer address whether a network node moniker or a virtual network address in other embodiments the resolution request may have other forms or computing nodes may request other types of information about computing nodes that have indicated target network node monikers or virtual network addresses.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine next continues to block to receive a response from the system manager module that includes a substrate network address and or other information corresponding to the identified target network node moniker or virtual network address and stores information locally that maps that substrate network address and or other information to a unique hardware address for later use by the routine e.g. based on a dummy virtual hardware address generated by the routine or provided in the response along with other information about the target destination as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. The routine then provides the hardware address to the requesting computing node which it may use as part of one or more later communications that it sends to the target destination with the indicated target network node moniker or virtual network address. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the substrate network address response that is provided may in some embodiments include a substrate network address that is specific to the target destination of interest while in other embodiments the substrate network address may correspond to an intermediate computing node of the virtual computer network via which communications to the target destination will be passed for some or all sending computing nodes or may instead correspond to a sub network or other group of multiple computing nodes to which the indicated computing node belongs such as to correspond to another communication manager module that manages those other computing nodes. If only some inter node communications to the target destination will be passed through a particular intermediate computing node such as for only some sending computing nodes it will be appreciated that the routine may obtain and store multiple entries for the target destination such as to include different information to use for different sending computing nodes that initiate inter node communications to the target destination. The routine then continues to block to determine if blocks were performed as part of the handling of an outgoing node communication as discussed with respect to blocks and if so continues to block . While not illustrated here in some embodiments the routine may instead receive an error response from the system manager module e.g. based on the requesting computing node not being authorized to communicate with the indicated destination node or no response and if so may not send any response to the requesting computing node or may send a corresponding error message to that computing node.

If it is instead determined in block that the type of communication or other message is an outgoing node communication from a computing node managed by the routine to another indicated target destination that is not a computing node also managed by the routine the routine continues to block to identify indicated information about the indicated target destination from the communication header for example in some embodiments the identified indicated information may include an indicated hardware address for the target destination while in other embodiments the identified indicated information may instead be the destination network node moniker or destination virtual network address from the header of a network packet or otherwise from a network communication e.g. if computing nodes of a managed computer network use network node monikers or virtual network addresses to directly specify destinations without using any other addressing scheme including without using any other network addresses or any hardware addresses and with an associated communication manager module directly translating between a specified network node moniker or virtual network address and a corresponding mapped substrate network address . The routine will similarly continue to block if communication manager module functionality of the routine is being performed by an edge module and the edge module has received a communication from an external node that is intended for one of the virtual computer network s multiple computing nodes that are connected to the substrate network. In block the routine then determines whether the identified indicated information is previously mapped to a substrate network address corresponding to the final destination such as previously discussed with respect to block . If not in some embodiments the routine continues to block to perform blocks to determine such a corresponding substrate network address for the outgoing node communication while in other embodiments such actions are not performed e.g. if the identified indicated information is not mapped the routine may cause the outgoing node communication to fail such as with an error message back to the sending node if the identified indicated information is not mapped but includes a destination network address that is an external address of an external computer system that is not part of the virtual computer network to proceed to perform blocks to send the communication to an edge device for forwarding outside of the substrate network etc. .

If the identified indicated information is mapped or the check is not performed the routine continues to block to retrieve the physical substrate network address that is mapped to the identified indicated information or multiple physical substrate network addresses if there are multiple computing nodes associated with the target destination network node moniker or virtual network address as well as information about any policies associated with the indicated target destination or with the source of the communication. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere if the communication is to be directed to one or more intermediate destination computing nodes along a routing path to the final destination the substrate network address that is used may correspond to a first such intermediate destination computing node as an initial destination. Similarly if the communication is to be directed to a final destination that is an external computer system at a remote location and there are not any computing nodes of the virtual computer network that are configured to act as intermediate destinations along a routing path to the final destination the substrate network address that is used may correspond to an edge module or similar device at the current location that will act as an initial destination to facilitate forwarding the communication on to the final destination at another location. In addition as discussed in greater detail elsewhere the retrieval of the substrate network address to use may include using locally stored mapping information such as based on a longest prefix match to various entries in the stored mapping information. In addition if any associated policies are applicable the routine then determines whether and how to send the communication in accordance with the policy ies including one or more particular destination computing nodes to receive the communication if multiple computing nodes are associated with the target destination network node moniker or virtual network address if a determination is made not to forward the communication in accordance with the policy ies the routine may return an error message to the sender or instead silently drop the communication without an indication to the sender and continue to block without performing blocks and .

In block for each destination computing node to receive the communication the routine then rewrites the communication header in accordance with a networking address protocol for one or more intermediate substrate networks between the sending computing node and destination using the corresponding substrate network address retrieved in block although in other embodiments the sending of a communication to multiple destination computing nodes may be performed in other manners e.g. if multiple destination computing nodes are managed by a single destination communication manager module to send a single communication to that destination communication manager module and to have that destination communication manager module provide appropriate corresponding copies to each of the managed destination computing nodes . The header rewriting for a particular communication to be sent may further include changing other information in the new header including changing a network node moniker or virtual network address for the sending computing node to be a corresponding substrate network address and in at least some embodiments includes doing the rewriting without using any other addressing schemes including not using any hardware addresses and not using any other network addresses and further in at least some embodiments includes modifying the received communication without encapsulation as part of an overlay of the virtual computer network over the one or more intermediate substrate networks. Furthermore for a communication having a destination hardware address corresponding to a logical networking device the routine in block may further perform other modifications that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by the one or more logical networking devices that would be used to forward the communication to the destination in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. In block the routine then facilitates the providing of each modified outgoing communication to its destination such as by initiating forwarding of the modified outgoing communication over the substrate intermediate network s toward the destination. While not illustrated here in other embodiments various additional types of processing may be performed for outgoing node communications such as to verify that the communications are valid or otherwise authorized in various ways e.g. to verify that the sending computing node is authorized to send communications to the destination such as based on being associated with the same entity or part of the same virtual computer network based on the sending computing node and destination being associated with different entities that are authorized to inter communicate based on the type of communication or other information specific to the communication etc. .

In some embodiments there may be an intermediate destination or multiple alternative intermediate destinations for use in forwarding a communication to a final destination such as multiple alternative intermediate computing nodes for use in exchanging communications between other computing nodes in accordance with a specified network topology of a managed virtual computer network. If a single intermediate destination is to be used the destination substrate network address retrieved in block will correspond to that intermediate destination. If multiple alternative intermediate destinations are available the system manager module selects a particular such alternative intermediate destination to use in the illustrated embodiment such as may be identified by the current routine with respect to information received in block . Maintaining the use of a single such alternative intermediate destination between a pair of sending destination nodes may provide various benefits including to enable continuity for a particular flow of communications or other group of multiple communications back and forth between two nodes. In other embodiments the selection of such a particular intermediate destination to use for a particular communication may be made in other manners including by the routine e.g. with respect to block and optionally in a dynamic manner for some or all such communications. For example the routine may instead receive in block a list or other indication of multiple substrate network addresses corresponding to some or all of the multiple alternative intermediate destinations and may then use that information as part of selecting a particular intermediate destination to use in a particular situation as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

If it is instead determined in block that the received message is an incoming node communication for one of the managed computing nodes from a node managed by a different communication manager module or by a edge module the routine continues instead to block to identify the substrate network addresses for the sender and for the destination computing node from the communication header. The routine will similarly continue to block if communication manager module functionality of the routine is being performed by an edge module and the edge module has received a communication from a managed computing node via the substrate network that is intended for an external computing system that is not connected to the substrate network. After block the routine continues to block to optionally verify that the incoming communication is valid in one or more ways. For example the routine may determine whether the substrate network address for the sender is actually mapped to a node that corresponds to the location from where the communication entered the substrate network such as based on interactions with a system manager module and or based on other information previously obtained and stored by the routine. In addition the routine may determine whether the substrate network address for the destination computing node corresponds to an actual managed computing node or external node. Furthermore if there are any policies associated with the sending and or destination computing nodes e.g. based on their associated network node monikers or virtual network addresses information about the policies may be retrieved and used to determine whether the current communication is authorized by the policy ies . While not illustrated here if an incoming communication is determined to not be valid the routine may take various actions not shown such as to generate one or more errors and perform associated processing and or drop the incoming communication without forwarding it to the indicated destination node. For example if the incoming communication indicates a destination substrate network address that does not correspond to a current managed computing node the routine may drop the incoming communication and or initiate an error message although in some embodiments such error messages are not sent to the sending computing node.

In the illustrated embodiment after block the routine continues to block to retrieve the network node moniker or virtual network address that are mapped to the destination substrate network address and to rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent to a computing node with that hardware address and that network node moniker or virtual network address in some embodiments the routine may further retrieve and use a hardware address mapped to the destination substrate network address although in other embodiments such hardware addresses may not be used in network packet headers or otherwise in network communications e.g. if computing nodes of a managed computer network use network node monikers or virtual network addresses to directly specify destinations without using any other addressing scheme including without using any other network addresses or any hardware addresses and with an associated communication manager module directly translating between a specified network node moniker or virtual network address and a corresponding mapped substrate network address . For example in some embodiments the destination network node moniker or virtual network address may be obtained from the destination substrate network address itself such as from a subset of the bits of the destination substrate network address. In addition the destination hardware address may have previously been mapped to the destination substrate network address such as previously discussed with respect to block . In situations in which such prior mapping has not occurred the routine may instead perform blocks to obtain such information although such actions are not illustrated in this example. The routine may similarly rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent from a node with a source network node moniker or virtual network address corresponding to the sender. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the routine in block may further perform other modifications to the incoming communication that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by one or more logical networking devices that would have been used to forward the communication to the destination computing node in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. After block the routine continues to block to facilitate providing of the modified incoming communication to the destination computing node such as by initiating forwarding of the modified incoming communication to the destination computing node.

If it is instead determined in block that a message of another type is received the routine continues to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate such as to store information about entities associated with particular computing nodes and or external nodes store configuration information about edge modules or other intermediate destinations store current or recent tracking information about intermediate destinations e.g. current load information for particular alternative destinations or other information about current characteristics of particular alternative destinations store information about configured network topologies for particular virtual computer networks respond to requests and other messages from computing nodes in a manner to provide logical networking functionality corresponding to configured network topologies for virtual computer networks e.g. by emulating actions and other functionalities that would be performed by specified logical networking devices if they were physically implemented update previously mapped or stored information to reflect changes with respect to computing nodes that are being managed or to non local nodes of a virtual computer network e.g. to update information when one or more computing nodes associated with a particular network node moniker or virtual network address changes perform operations to forward communications between multiple managed computing nodes of the communication manager module without forwarding such communications over the substrate network etc. The storing and or updating of stored information may be initiated in various manners such as by receiving information in response to previous requests periodically requesting such information receiving information that is proactively pushed to the routine without a corresponding request etc.

After blocks or or if it is instead determined in block that the processing is not being performed with respect to an outgoing communication the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.
