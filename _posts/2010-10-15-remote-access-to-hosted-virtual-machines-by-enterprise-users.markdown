title: Remote access to hosted virtual machines by enterprise users
abstract: An end user of an enterprise is enabled to receive secure remote presentation access to the assigned virtual machines in a hosted public cloud through the cloud provider's virtualization hosts and remote presentation gateway. Thus an enterprise administrator may purchase computing capacity from the cloud provider and further sub-divide the purchased computing capacity among enterprise end users. The cloud provider need not create shadow accounts for each end user of the enterprise. The cloud provider AD and the enterprise AD do not need to trust each other. The cloud provider also need not expose host information to the tenants. Authorization may be provided by using a combination of a custom authorization plug-in at the terminal services gateway and an indirection listener component at the virtualization host. The host details may also be abstracted when the client connects to the remote presentation gateway so as to protect the fabric from attack and enabling the tenant virtual machines to freely move across the cloud provider's virtualization hosts.

One increasingly popular form of networking may generally be referred to as remote presentation systems which can use protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol remote presentation and Independent Computing Architecture ICA to share a desktop and other applications executing on a server with a remote client. Such computing systems typically transmit the keyboard presses and mouse clicks or selections from the client to the server relaying the screen updates back in the other direction over a network connection. As such the user has the experience as if his or her machine is operating entirely locally when in reality the client device is only sent screenshots of the desktop or applications as they appear on the server side.

Many enterprises that provide virtual machines to their users are purchasing computing capacity from public cloud providers. Cloud providers also known as public hosters sell computing capacity in the form of a virtual machine that the end user pays for on a pay as you go basis. Similarly an enterprise can also purchase computing capacity from these cloud providers to extend its computing capacity. The cloud providers may use virtualization hosts to deploy virtual machines and sell virtual machines to the enterprise tenants. The virtualization hosts in the cloud provider s data center may be joined to the cloud provider s domain whereas the tenant purchaser of the cloud service s computing capacity owns the actual virtual machines.

An enterprise tenant typically has many users. The tenant may further subdivide the computing capacity and assign individual virtual machines rented from the cloud to individual users from his enterprise. These users need access to those virtual machines in a similar way that they would access their local computers. For example a remote desktop protocol may be used to access the virtual machines. At the service provider the infrastructure ay be set up in such a way that all remote desktop access to the virtual machines is accomplished through the host computer.

One problem with the above scenario is that remote presentation access to virtual machines in the cloud through the cloud provider s virtualization hosts must be secured for an end user of the tenant s enterprise.

In various embodiments methods and systems are disclosed for enabling an end user of the enterprise to receive secure remote presentation access to the assigned virtual machines in a hosted public cloud through the cloud provider s virtualization hosts and remote presentation gateway. Thus an enterprise administrator may purchase computing capacity from the cloud provider and further sub divide the purchased computing capacity among enterprise end users. The cloud provider need not create shadow accounts for each end user of an enterprise that is a consumer of the computing capacity. The cloud provider also need not expose host information to the tenants. The cloud provider also need not expose host information to the internet. In an embodiment custom tokens signed with X.509 certificates may be used to secure the remote presentation access. In other embodiments SAML tokens with security token service STS for identity federation may be used.

In one embodiment authorization may be provided by using a combination of a custom authorization plug in at the terminal services gateway and an indirection listener component at the virtualization host. The enterprise administrator may thus be able to further sub divide the purchased public cloud capacity and assign tenant virtual machines among end users without requiring the public cloud provider aka hoster to create shadow accounts for each enterprise end user. The host details may also be abstracted when the client connects to the remote presentation gateway so as to protect the fabric from attack and enabling the tenant virtual machines to freely move across the cloud provider s virtualization hosts without impacting remote presentation access.

In addition to the foregoing other aspects are described in the claims drawings and text forming a part of the present disclosure. It can be appreciated by one of skill in the art that one or more various aspects of the disclosure may include but are not limited to circuitry and or programming for effecting the herein referenced aspects of the present disclosure the circuitry and or programming can be virtually any combination of hardware software and or firmware configured to effect the herein referenced aspects depending upon the design choices of the system designer.

The foregoing is a summary and thus contains by necessity simplifications generalizations and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.

Finally while various methods are described with reference to steps and sequences in the following disclosure the description as such is for providing a clear implementation of embodiments of the disclosure and the steps and sequences of steps should not be taken as required to practice this disclosure.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the disclosure or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the disclosure. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device generally includes a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the disclosure e.g. through the use of an application programming interface API reusable controls or the like. Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications and operating systems that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol remote presentation to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client

The term circuitry used throughout the disclosure can include hardware components such as hardware interrupt controllers hard drives network adaptors graphics processors hardware based video audio codecs and the firmware software used to operate such hardware. The term circuitry can also include microprocessors configured to perform function s by firmware or by switches set in a certain way or one or more logical processors e.g. one or more cores of a multi core general processing unit. The logical processor s in this example can be configured by software instructions embodying logic operable to perform function s that are loaded from memory e.g. RAM ROM firmware and or virtual memory. In example embodiments where circuitry includes a combination of hardware and software an implementer may write source code embodying logic that is subsequently compiled into machine readable code that can be executed by a logical processor. Since one skilled in the art can appreciate that the state of the art has evolved to a point where there is little difference between hardware software or a combination of hardware software the selection of hardware versus software to effectuate functions is merely a design choice. Thus since one of skill in the art can appreciate that a software process can be transformed into an equivalent hardware structure and a hardware structure can itself be transformed into an equivalent software process the selection of a hardware implementation versus a software implementation is trivial and left to an implementer.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol remote presentation to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client computer system. The client computer system presents the output data. Thus input is received and output presented at the client computer system while processing actually occurs at the terminal server. A session can include a shell and a user interface such as a desktop the subsystems that track mouse movement within the desktop the subsystems that translate a mouse click on an icon into commands that effectuate an instance of a program etc. In another example embodiment the session can include an application. In this example while an application is rendered a desktop environment may still be generated and hidden from the user. It should be understood that the foregoing discussion is exemplary and that the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in various client server environments and not limited to a particular terminal services product.

In most if not all remote desktop environments input data entered at a client computer system typically includes mouse and keyboard data representing commands to an application and output data generated by an application at the terminal server typically includes video data for display on a video output device. Many remote desktop environments also include functionality that extend to transfer other types of data.

Communications channels can be used to extend the remote presentation protocol by allowing plug ins to transfer data over a remote presentation connection. Many such extensions exist. Features such as printer redirection clipboard redirection port redirection etc. use communications channel technology. Thus in addition to input and output data there may be many communications channels that need to transfer data. Accordingly there may be occasional requests to transfer output data and one or more channel requests to transfer other data contending for available network bandwidth.

Turning to illustrated is an exemplary virtual machine server that can be used to generate virtual machines. In this embodiment hypervisor microkernel can be configured to control and arbitrate access to the hardware of computer system . Hypervisor microkernel can isolate processes in one partition from accessing another partition s resources. For example hypervisor microkernel can generate execution environments called partitions such as child partition through child partition N where N is an integer greater than 1 . In this embodiment a child partition is the basic unit of isolation supported by hypervisor microkernel . Each child partition can be mapped to a set of hardware resources e.g. memory devices logical processor cycles etc. that is under control of the hypervisor microkernel . In embodiments hypervisor microkernel can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard specialized integrated circuits or a combination thereof.

Hypervisor microkernel can enforce partitioning by restricting a guest operating system s view of the memory in a physical computer system. When hypervisor microkernel instantiates a virtual machine it can allocate pages e.g. fixed length blocks of memory with starting and ending addresses of system physical memory SPM to the virtual machine as guest physical memory GPM . In this embodiment the guest s restricted view of system memory is controlled by hypervisor microkernel . The term guest physical memory is a shorthand way of describing a page of memory from the viewpoint of a virtual machine and the term system physical memory is shorthand way of describing a page of memory from the viewpoint of the physical system. Thus a page of memory allocated to a virtual machine will have a guest physical address the address used by the virtual machine and a system physical address the actual address of the page .

A guest operating system may virtualize guest physical memory. Virtual memory is a management technique that allows an operating system to over commit memory and to give an application sole access to a contiguous working memory. In a virtualized environment a guest operating system can use one or more page tables to translate virtual addresses known as virtual guest addresses into guest physical addresses. In this example a memory address may have a guest virtual address a guest physical address and a system physical address.

In the depicted example parent partition component which can also be also thought of as similar to domain of Xen s open source hypervisor can include a host . Host can be an operating system or a set of configuration utilities and host can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in the child partitions N by using virtualization service providers VSPs . VPSs which are typically referred to as back end drivers in the open source community can be used to multiplex the interfaces to the hardware resources by way of virtualization service clients VSCs typically referred to as front end drivers in the open source community or paravirtualized devices . As shown by the figures virtualization service clients execute within the context of guest operating systems. However these drivers are different than the rest of the drivers in the guest in that they may be supplied with a hypervisor not with a guest. In an exemplary embodiment the path used to by virtualization service providers to communicate with virtualization service clients and can be thought of as the virtualization path.

As shown by the figure emulators e.g. virtualized IDE devices virtualized video adaptors virtualized NICs etc. can be configured to run within host and are attached to resources available to guest operating systems and . For example when a guest OS touches a memory location mapped to where a register of a device would be or memory mapped to a device microkernel hypervisor can intercept the request and pass the values the guest attempted to write to an associated emulator. The resources in this example can be thought of as where a virtual device is located. The use of emulators in this way can be considered the emulation path. The emulation path is inefficient compared to the virtualized path because it requires more CPU resources to emulate device than it does to pass messages between VSPs and VSCs. For example the hundreds of actions on memory mapped to registers required in order to write a value to disk via the emulation path may be reduced to a single message passed from a VSC to a VSP in the virtualization path.

Each child partition can include one or more virtual processors and that guest operating systems and can manage and schedule threads to execute thereon. Generally the virtual processors are executable instructions and associated state information that provide a representation of a physical processor with a specific architecture. For example one virtual machine may have a virtual processor having characteristics of an Intel x86 processor whereas another virtual processor may have the characteristics of a PowerPC processor. The virtual processors in this example can be mapped to logical processors of the computer system such that the instructions that effectuate the virtual processors will be backed by logical processors. Thus in an embodiment including multiple logical processors virtual processors can be simultaneously executed by logical processors while for example other logical processor execute hypervisor instructions. The combination of virtual processors and memory in a partition can be considered a virtual machine.

Guest operating systems and can be any operating system such as for example operating systems from Microsoft Apple the open source community etc. The guest operating systems can include user kernel modes of operation and can have kernels that can include schedulers memory managers etc. Generally speaking kernel mode can include an execution mode in a logical processor that grants access to at least privileged processor instructions. Each guest operating system can have associated file systems that can have applications stored thereon such as terminal servers e commerce servers email servers etc. and the guest operating systems themselves. The guest operating systems can schedule threads to execute on the virtual processors and instances of such applications can be effectuated.

Referring now to illustrated is a virtual machine server based on an alternative architecture. depicts similar components to those of however in this example embodiment hypervisor can include a microkernel component and components similar to those in host of such as the virtualization service providers and device drivers while management operating system may contain for example configuration utilities used to configure hypervisor . In this architecture hypervisor can perform the same or similar functions as hypervisor microkernel of however in this architecture hypervisor can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in the child partitions. Hypervisor of can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard or a portion of hypervisor can be effectuated by specialized integrated circuits.

Turning now to illustrated is a high level block diagram of virtual desktop server . In an embodiment virtual desktop server can be configured to deploy virtual desktop sessions VDS to clients e.g. mobile devices such as smart phones computer systems having components similar to those illustrated in etc. Briefly virtual desktop technology allows a user to remotely interact with a guest operating system running in a virtual machine. Unlike a remote desktop session in a virtual desktop session only one user is logged into a guest operating system and can have total control of it e.g. the user can run as an administrator and can have full rights on the guest. In the illustrated example virtual desktop server can have components similar to computer system or of or . In the illustrated example virtualization platform is a logical abstraction of virtualization infrastructure components described above in and . The functionality described in the following sections as within virtualization platform can be implemented in one or more of the elements depicted in or . For example virtual desktop manager could be implemented in a host of . More specifically virtual desktop manager could be implemented in a host operating system running in the parent partition of a virtualized environment.

Starting a virtual desktop session requires instantiation of a guest operating system within a virtual machine. In an exemplary embodiment virtual desktop manager e.g. a module of processor executable instructions can start up virtual machine along with guest operating system in response to a request. Virtual desktop manager can execute on a logical processor and instruct virtualization platform e.g. microkernel hypervisor to allocate memory for a partition. Virtualization platform can execute and set virtual devices up within virtual machine and load a boot loader program into virtual machine memory. The boot loader program can execute on a virtual processor and load guest operating system . For example session manager can be loaded which can instantiate environment subsystems such as runtime subsystem that can include a kernel mode part such as operating system core . For example the environment subsystems in an embodiment can be configured to expose a subset of services to application programs and provide an access point to kernel . When guest operating system is loaded the boot loader program can exit and turn control of the virtual machine over to guest operating system . Guest operating system can execute the various modules illustrated in and configure itself to host a virtual desktop session. For example guest operating system can include registry values that cause remote presentation engine and or configuration service to start upon boot.

A virtual desktop session can start when guest operating system receives a connection request over a network from a client. A connection request can first be handled by remote presentation engine . The remote presentation engine can be configured to listen for connection messages and forward them to session manager . As illustrated by when sessions are generated the remote presentation engine can run a protocol stack instances for the session. Generally the protocol stack instance can be configured to route user interface output to an associated client and route user input received from the associated client to operating system core . Briefly operating system core can be configured to manage screen output collect input from keyboards mice and other devices.

A user credential e.g. a username password combination can be received by remote presentation engine and passed to session manager . Session manager can pass the credential to a logon procedure which can route the credential to authentication engine for verification. Authentication engine can generate a system token which can be used whenever a user attempts to execute a process to determine whether the user has the security credentials to run the process or thread. For example when a process or thread attempts to gain access e.g. open close delete and or modify an object e.g. a file setting or an application the thread or process can be authenticated by security subsystem . Security subsystem can check the system token against an access control list associated with the object and determine whether the thread has permission based on a comparison of information in the system token and the access control list. If security subsystem determines that the thread is authorized then the thread can be allowed to access the object.

Continuing with the description of in an embodiment the operating system core can include a graphics display interface GDI and input subsystem . Input subsystem in an example embodiment can be configured to receive user input from a client via the protocol stack instance for the virtual desktop session and send the input to operating system core . The user input can in some embodiments include signals indicative of absolute and or relative mouse movement commands mouse coordinates mouse clicks keyboard signals joystick movement signals etc. User input for example a mouse double click on an icon can be received by the operating system core and the input subsystem can be configured to determine that an icon is located at the coordinates associated with the double click. Input subsystem can then be configured to send a notification to runtime subsystem that can execute a process for the application associated with the icon.

Draw commands can be received from applications and or a desktop and processed by GDI . GDI in general can include a process that can generate graphical object draw commands. GDI in this example embodiment can be configured to pass the commands to remote display subsystem that can instantiate a display driver for the session. In an example embodiment remote display subsystem can be configured to include virtual display driver s that can be configured to receive the draw commands and send them to the client.

Also shown in is a configuration service . In an exemplary embodiment configuration service can be used to setup guest operating system to conduct virtual desktop sessions prior to connection by a client. For example configuration service can run within guest operating system and be executed when guest operating system boots. Since certain configuration settings require administrative privileges configuration service can be configured to run as a process with system wide privileges. Some of the exemplary actions configuration service can take include but are not limited to actions that add an account identifier for the user to a list of administrative users for guest operating system add the account identifier to a list of authorized virtual desktop users set registry values open guest operating system firewalls and open the port that remote presentation engine listens for connections on. Configuration service is described in more detail in the following paragraphs.

In an exemplary embodiment a communication channel can be established between virtualization platform and guest operating system in order to configure and control guest operating system . Since a remote user can have complete control of virtual machine security needs to be in place to ensure that any channel used to configure and control guest operating system can not also be used to attack virtualization platform or other computer systems connected to an internal network. Traditionally a networked communication channel is used to setup and control guest operating system . Network channels however are difficult to deploy when guest operating system is not in the same network domain as virtualization platform and virtualization platform is configured to deny incoming connection requests from outside the domain.

In an exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be used to communicate with configuration server in order to configure and or manage the virtual desktop session. Inter partition communication channel can be configured to be implicitly trusted by virtual machine and not trusted by virtualization platform . In this example information e.g. data and or commands can be easily routed to guest operating system without any need to verify the information. On the other hand data received from virtual machine can be verified and authenticated before virtualization platform takes an action. Moreover because inter partition communication channel does not use networking guest operating system can be kept off the internal network.

Inter partition communication channel can be implicitly trusted by virtual machine i.e. information received via the channel is inherently authenticated validated because only virtualization platform can create inter partition communication channel . For example in an embodiment inter partition communication channel can be implemented at least in part as a region of memory shared between virtual machine and virtualization platform . Virtualization platform can cause a data structure indicative of a ring buffer or the like to be created in region of shared memory that can be used as a full duplex communication channel between virtualization platform and virtual machine . In an exemplary embodiment the inter partition communication channel can include features described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 689 800 entitled Partition bus the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Virtualization platform can write information to inter partition communication channel that can be read by virtual machine . In an exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be message based. That is virtualization platform and virtual machine can be configured to write packets of data to inter partition communication channel . In the same or another exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be event driven. In this configuration when information is written to the channel the receiver can be instructed to read the information from inter partition communication channel by for example hypervisor of .

Turning now to illustrated is a high level block diagram of a datacenter including virtual desktop server virtual desktop server licensing server broker server gateway and client . The datacenter can be configured to deploy virtual desktop sessions to clients. In the illustrated example virtualization platform virtual desktop server licensing server broker server and gateway can be part of an intranet and the user credentials used to log into these computers can be members of the same domain i.e. the infrastructure domain . Infrastructure domain is shown in dashed lines cutting virtual desktop server in half to illustrate that in an exemplary embodiment virtual machine can be part of a different domain or part of no domain. Furthermore virtual machine can be part of a different network or part of no network at all.

The datacenter can include an internal network coupling a plurality of virtual desktop servers and which can include components similar to those illustrated by or to broker server and licensing server . As one of skill in the art can appreciate while two virtual desktop servers are shown the datacenter can have many more. Also while virtual desktop server is illustrated running one virtual machine each virtual desktop server can simultaneously host many virtual machines. Or put another way the datacenter can have M where M is an integer greater than 1 virtual desktop servers and each of the M virtualization hosts can host N where N is also an integer greater than 1 virtual machines.

Broker server can act as an interface to the intranet for client . Briefly broker server can include components similar to the components described with respect to . Broker server can have a network adapter that interfaces it to a public network such as the Internet and another network adapter that interfaces it to the internal network i.e. the intranet. In this example broker server can act as a gateway for the internal network thereby allowing virtual desktop servers and licensing server to be kept off the public network.

When user of client wants a virtual desktop session he or she can click on an icon and client can send one or more packets of information to broker server . Broker server can include a module of software instructions that upon execution cause a logical processor to select a suitable virtualization host to instantiate a virtual machine to host the virtual desktop session. A user credential e.g. a username and password combination can be collected and broker server can check session database to determine whether the datacenter includes any disconnected virtual desktop sessions associated with the user credential such as a username password combination. If session database includes a disconnected virtual desktop session associated with the user credential broker server can send a signal to the virtualization host that has the disconnected session and instruct it to execute the virtual machine. If session database does not have information indicative of a disconnected session for the user broker server can select a suitable virtual desktop server e.g. one that has the resources available to instantiate a virtual machine to host a virtual desktop session.

Virtualization platform can instantiate virtual machine and execute guest operating system on a virtual processor. Referring back to guest operating system can run remote presentation engine return an internet protocol IP address of virtual NIC to broker server and await a connection from client . Broker server can return the IP address of virtual NIC to client in a packet of information that causes a logical processor of client to redirect client to the IP address virtual machine . Gateway can receive the connection request and forward it to virtual NIC .

In an least one exemplary embodiment session manager can be configured to check to see if the client is associated with a valid license before starting the virtual desktop session. Remote presentation engine can receive a license from client or information associated with a license and send the information to virtualization platform which can send the license or the information associated with the license to licensing server . Licensing server can include license validation engine which can be configured to determine whether a license associated with client is valid. If the license is valid license validation engine can send a signal back virtual desktop server and a virtual desktop session can be started. At this point remote presentation engine can stream one or more packets of information indicative of a graphical user interface for guest operating system to client and receive one or more packets of information indicative of user input from client .

In an exemplary embodiment when virtualization platform receives a request from broker server to instantiate a virtual machine virtual desktop manager can execute and send commands and or information via inter partition communication channel to virtual machine to cause guest operating system to be configured to conduct a virtual desktop session. Configuration service can receive the commands and or information and configure guest operating system accordingly. For example virtual desktop manager can send the identity of the user attempting to connect desired settings for a firewall protecting guest operating system registry values a list of applications the user is allowed to operate commands to enable virtual desktop sessions and to add the identity of the user to a list of authorized virtual desktop users etc. Configuration service can execute on a virtual processor and change appropriate settings.

Once the virtual desktop session is running virtual desktop manager can manage a running virtual desktop session via inter partition communication channel . For example virtual desktop manager can issue commands to virtual machine such as commands that cause the guest operating system to shut down disconnect the user reset the guest operating system etc. In the same or another embodiment virtual desktop manager can manage the virtual desktop session receive state information for virtual machine status information from remote presentation engine and or send commands to control the virtual desktop session to configuration service . For example virtual desktop manager can receive state information for virtual machine that indicates whether virtual machine is running paused ready booting as well as a list of IP addresses that can be sent to the client. In addition virtual desktop manager can receive status information for guest operating system such as the identity of the user that is logged in for the virtual desktop session and communicate some or all of this information to broker server .

The computers depicted in may be similar to the computer depicted in . In a client communicates with a deployment which comprises authentication server connection broker gateway remote application server farm which in turn comprises two homogenously configured servers remote application servers and VM server farm which in turn comprises two homogenously configured VMs VMs .

Client has a workspace that comprises multiple remote resources served by one or more of remote application servers and VMs . Client may log into its workspace through an authentication server . Once authenticated the client s request to connect to its workspace is transmitted from authentication server to connection broker . Connection broker is configured to broker connections between client and the application servers and VMs that will serve remote resources with client and to effectuate this connection broker is configured to communicate with application servers and VMs to determine what resources they are currently serving including disconnected remote resources for a user of client .

Client may have a workspace that comprises multiple remote resources a remote resource comprising a remote application from remote application server and a remote resource that comprises a VM from VM . As depicted client does not have a remote resource with remote application server or VM . These may each serve different applications or desktops versions of an application or other permutations. For instance remote application server may be serving client with a remoted word processor application and VM may be serving client with a remote desktop.

As can be seen through this depiction when a user wishes to reconnect back to his or her workspace he may desire to reconnect to the remote resources of both remote application server and VM through one command rather than through one command performed three times. The user may perform this reconnect operation from client or from another client computer such as where client is the user s computer at work and the user wishes to reconnect from a computer at home during the weekend .

A user of client has previously had a workspace to remote server farm that involved accessing a remote resource from VM and this workspace is now disconnected. Before client even attempts to reconnect to the deployment authentication server publishes a document via communication to client identifying information about the deployment that client may use to access the remote resources of the deployment . Client later reconnects by sending communication to authentication server . Authentication server validates credentials of the user and or client such as a login and password . Where the credentials are validated authentication server communicates with connection broker to determine which remote resources here VM client is to reconnect to when reconnecting its workspace. Authentication server makes this determination by sending communication to connection broker and in response receiving back in communication a list of server farms here VM farm for client to reconnect to. This information indicated in communication is passed by authentication server to client in communication .

When client has the list of servers to reconnect to from authentication server client reestablishes a communication with each of those server farms. As depicted in that server farm is VM farm . Client does not have the ability to directly contact either connection broker or VM farm . Gateway is thus used at the edge of the networked environment to facilitate the request and transcend the network boundaries. Client communicates with gateway to access the remote resources of these server farms. Gateway processes communication and in turn communicates with connection broker to convey similar information. Connection broker takes the identification of the server farm from communication and from it identifies the machine VM within the farm that has that disconnected remote resource. Connection broker sends communication to VM instructing VM to reconnect the remote resource to client . VM reconnects with client by sending a communication indicative of the same to gateway which in turn sends a communication indicative of the same to client .

It may be appreciated that this is a simplified diagram to emphasize the present invention and that more or fewer server farms may be present and or reconnected to and that the communications passed may be more involved for instance it is shown that communications and establish a reconnection between VM and client where this may also involve communications that are send from client through gateway and to VM .

All of these variations for implementing the above mentioned virtual machines are just exemplary implementations and nothing herein should be interpreted as limiting the disclosure to any particular virtualization aspect.

Many enterprises that provide virtual machines to their users are purchasing computing capacity from public cloud providers. Cloud providers also known as public hosters sell computing capacity in the form of a virtual machine that the end user pays for on a pay as you go basis. Similarly an enterprise can also purchase computing capacity from these cloud providers to extend its computing capacity. The cloud providers may use virtualization hosts to deploy virtual machines and sell virtual machines to the enterprise tenants. The virtualization hosts in the cloud provider s data center may be joined to the cloud provider s domain whereas the tenant purchaser of the cloud service s computing capacity owns the actual virtual machines.

An enterprise tenant typically has many users. The tenant may further subdivide the computing capacity and assign individual virtual machines rented from the cloud to individual users from his enterprise. These users need access to those virtual machines in a similar way that they would access their local computers. For example a remote desktop protocol may be used to access the virtual machines. At the service provider the infrastructure may be set up in such a way that all remote desktop access to the virtual machines is accomplished through the host computer.

As described above a domain may be a logical group of computers that share a central directory database. This central directory e.g. Active Directory contains user accounts and security information for the resources in that domain. Each user within a domain may receive a unique account or user name. This account can then be assigned access to resources within the domain. Computers inside a domain can be assigned into organizational units according to location organizational structure or other factors. Computers can connect to a domain via LAN or via WAN using a VPN connection. The domain may provide support for a certification authority to confirm identities.

One problem with the above scenario is that remote presentation access to virtual machines in the cloud through the cloud provider s virtualization hosts must be secured for an end user of the tenant enterprise. Typically such virtual machines are secured using credentials from the hoster s domain. However the actual consumer i.e. the client of the virtual machine does not have access to those credentials because access to this virtual machine was sub delegated to them.

In various embodiments methods and systems are disclosed for enabling an end user of the enterprise to receive secure remote presentation access to the assigned virtual machines in a hosted public cloud through the cloud provider s virtualization hosts and remote presentation gateway. Thus an enterprise administrator may purchase computing capacity from the cloud provider and further sub divide the purchased computing capacity among enterprise end users. The cloud provider need not create shadow accounts for each end user of the enterprise. The cloud provider also need not expose host information to the tenants. In an embodiment custom tokens signed with X.509 certificates may be used. In other embodiments SAML tokens with STS for identity federation may be used.

In one embodiment authorization may be provided by using a combination of a custom authorization plug in at the terminal services gateway and an indirection listener component at the virtualization host. The enterprise administrator may thus be able to further sub divide the purchased public cloud capacity and assign tenant virtual machines among end users without creating shadow accounts for each end user. The host details may also be abstracted when the client connects to the remote presentation gateway so as to protect the hoster s fabric from attack and enabling the tenant virtual machines to freely move across the cloud provider s virtualization hosts.

1. Either SAML tokens STS or Custom tokens X.509 Certificates may be used. Security Assertion Markup Language SAML is an XML based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains. The security domains are typically an identity provider and a service provider. X.509 is an ITU T standard for a public key infrastructure for single sign on SSO and Privilege Management Infrastructure PMI .

2. The cloud provider need not create shadow accounts in the cloud provider s Active Directory for each end user of the enterprise.

3. The enterprise administrator who purchases the capacity from the cloud provider may further sub divide the cloud resources among end users of the enterprise. Each end user should have access only to the virtual machines assigned to the user by the enterprise administrator. The cloud provider assigns virtual machines to the enterprise administrator and the enterprise administrator in turn further sub divides the virtual machines among the end users of that enterprise. The end user does not have direct access to the virtual machine.

4. The cloud provider need not expose host information. Tenant virtual machines can be migrated freely within cloud provider s virtualization hosts.

5. The cloud provider s hosts are not exposed directly to the internet and will be shielded through the remote presentation gateway.

6. The end user client of the enterprise does not proxy through an enterprise server but communicates directly with the cloud provider s remote presentation gateway.

7. Tenant virtual machines can be in their own isolated networks or can be any other networking configuration including having no network connection at all.

9. Multi tenant scenarios should be supported. The remote presentation gateway should be shared among different tenants. Many enterprises can purchase capacity from a service provider and act as tenants. Furthermore such enterprises can sub divide the capacity across their respective end users.

A self service portal may be a web component that extends management of virtual machines to end users. The self service portal may be a extensible component built on top of a virtualization system. The self service portal can be used to pool allocate and manage resources to offer infrastructure as a service and to deliver the foundation for a private cloud platform inside the enterprise. The self service portal extends the assignment of virtual machines to end users. The self service portal may include a web based user interface that includes sections for datacenter managers and business unit IT consumers. The self service portal may include a dynamic provisioning engine and may reduce the time needed to provision infrastructures and their components by offering business unit on boarding and infrastructure request and change management.

In an embodiment the terminal service gateway can have a custom authentication and authorization plug in. When a client requests a remote desktop the client can send a cookie with their credentials. The plug in can authenticate the cookie and authorize the caller. An additional authorization may be needed at the virtualization host to authorize access to a specific virtual machine. In one embodiment this can be achieved with an intermediary listening service on a host. All the above are needed for a secure connection.

In an embodiment an enterprise end user may use an authentication mechanism for logging into the self service portal of the enterprise. For example the enterprise user may use Kerberos authentication to log into the self service portal.

More generally when an enterprise purchases capacity from a cloud provider the cloud provider has its own domain and active directory. The enterprise has its own domain and active directory. Accordingly the enterprise and cloud provider need not have trust between them. Thus is it desirable for the user in the enterprise to connect to the virtual machine that the user owns at the cloud provider.

In an embodiment it is further desirable that existing enterprise components and capabilities such as the terminal services gateway and existing remote presentation protocols such as RDP are utilized.

In an embodiment a cookie is created that includes claims that are needed by the custom authorization plug in.

One problem is that some systems may be designed for remote presentation access to a guest OS directly but not for remote presentation access to the host.

Another problem is how to achieve a remote console connection to a virtual machine through a non trusted domain.

In one embodiment the terminal services gateway may provide a pluggable authentication and authorization module to support an authentication mechanism. The client can send an arbitrary array of bytes through a cookie to the terminal services gateway. The terminal services gateway can notify a custom resource authorization plug in part of the pluggable authentication and authorization module with the name of the target resource before allowing the connection. While this may work in the case of a remote session to the target machine when this is used for console access to guest virtual machines through the virtualization host s single port listener service the target resource specified is the virtualization host. However the real target is the virtual machine running on the virtualization host.

An end user can connect to his virtual in at least two ways a directly by using remote desktop into the virtual machine or b by leveraging a single port listener SPL . If the end user is using the single port listener then the user connects to a host computer port. The host authenticates using CredSSP and validates that this user has access to the virtual machine they want to connect to. The host then redirects the remote desktop session to the virtual machine through a private interface on the host. The component that performs these functions is called the single port listener. The single port listener allows a VMM to connect to any virtual machine through a host connection without imposing any networking requirements on the virtual machine. The single port listener may also allow an end user to connect to the portal from a client computer using a browser such as Internet Explorer. The end user can then chose to connect to a virtual machine and view the console session.

The virtual machine ID may be passed e.g. in a pre connection blob to the virtualization host s single port listener at the destination as part of the remote presentation protocol. Since the pre connection blob may not be exposed at the custom resource authorization plug in a full virtual machine level granular authorization using either SAML tokens or custom certificate tokens sent as a cookie to the terminal services gateway may not be possible. The custom resource authorization plug in needs to have access to the pre connection blob for the connection in order to validate it as part of the connection s resource authorization. The authorization plug in needs to validate the information present in the cookie with the actual target resource being accessed. The target virtual machine ID can be retrieved through the cookie but authorization that the target connection from the gateway is actually that virtual machine is still needed.

The custom resource authorization module at the RD Gateway is only aware of the target virtualization host and a port to access. The real target is the guest virtual machine running in the virtualization host. For example a malicious user could present a signed claim to the terminal services gateway s authorization plug in requesting access to a virtual machine running in the host. The user can specify the pre connection blob to point to another virtual machine running in the same host. The gateway s authorization plug in cannot cross check the claims with the actual target virtual machine running in the same host.

With reference to the following illustrative example is provided to depict one embodiment of the present disclosure. Let us assume that virtual machines VM and VM of the Cloud domain are assigned to the enterprise Enterprise by the cloud provider Cloud . The enterprise administrator assigns VM to Enterprise User and VM to Enterprise User.

In this example a client refers to the Enterprise remote presentation client. The Enterprise remote presentation client can be an administrator console. In an embodiment the console can be a process or an Active X control loaded into the self service portal s page.

CloudProvider creates two user accounts in its Active Directory per enterprise that has purchased capacity from it. Illustrating with example let Cloud Enterprise be the user account created in the Cloud domain for the administrator of Enterprise. Cloud Enterprise is not shared by the Enterprise administrator to all the end users of Enterprise. Let Cloud EnterpriseT be another user account created in the Cloud domain for the sole purpose of console access to all of the virtual machines owned by the Enterprise. Cloud EnterpriseT has only consoleaccess privileges enforced by the Virtualization Host e.g. Hyper V using AzMan to all the virtual machines owned by this specificEnterprise in the Cloud provider s domain.

Virtualization Host s Virtual Machine Management System single port listener mandates authenticating incoming connections using the CredSSP protocol. Enterprise end user s client needs to use the user account Cloud EnterpriseT for authenticating at the CloudProvider s virtualization host using the CredSSP protocol. This credential is handed to the client by the Enterprise Virtual Machine Management system along with the signed token. Credential SSP is a Security Support Provider that provides Single Sign On SSO . It is important to note that the end user does not enter this credential explicitly but it is handled automatically by the client after communicating with the Enterprise Virtual Machine Management system. More importantly in our case this authentication mechanism imposed by Single Port Listener is useless because we do not want a user of the enterprise getting access to a VM belonging to even another user of the same enterprise. Our primary authentication and authorization mechanism is using signed tokens. Nevertheless this does serve as an additional defense layer in protecting one enterprise tenant from another different enterprise.

A cookie is a generally data comprising text and stored by a user s web browser or in memory. A cookie can be used for authentication storing site preferences shopping cart contents the identifier for a server based session or anything else that can be accomplished through storing text data.

Authorization can be performed either at the terminal services gateway or at the destination host or both. However full authorization at the terminal services gateway is typically not possible. The terminal services gateway s custom resource authorization plug in needs to have access to the pre connection blob for that connection and thus the terminal services gateway s custom resource authorization plug in is not suited for console access to guest virtual machines through the virtualization host s single port listener.

Accordingly in an embodiment authorization is performed at the virtualization host. Since a shadow account cannot be created for each user of the enterprise in the cloud provider s Active Directory one option is to create a local account for each virtual machine in the local host. That local account would be shared with the enterprise end users and would only be authorized to access the console session of the virtual machine. Alternatively if it is not desirable to manage numerous local user accounts this needs to be managed out of band between Hoster and Enterprise virtual machine management systems which could be a concern for cloud providers then the intermediary listener approach may be used.

The intermediary listener service in the virtualization system host can either be a separate service network service or part of an existing host agent local system account . In order to secure the side band notifications from the terminal services gateway to the intermediary service in the host the intermediary listener may use a WMI provider.

If a malicious user changes the token ID the signature on the token may be invalidated. The token ID in the signed token and the pre connection blob must correlate.

Any of the above mentioned aspects can be implemented in methods systems computer readable media or any type of manufacture. For example a computer readable medium can store thereon computer executable instructions for accessing a virtual machine hosted in a first domain by a client computer in a second domain. Such media can comprise a first subset of instructions for establishing a communication session with a virtualization host in the first domain a second subset of instructions for sending to a virtualization host in the first domain a virtual machine identifier and a claim requesting authorization for access to the identified virtual machine a third subset of instructions for receiving a signed token from the virtualization manager in the second domain a fourth subset of instructions for establishing a remote presentation session through the virtualization host in the first domain and sending an indication that a cookie based authorization will be performed a fifth subset of instructions for sending to the virtualization host in the first domain a cookie including a signed token and public key and a sixth subset of instructions for establishing a remote presentation session with the requested virtual machine. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional sets of instructions can be used to capture the various other aspects disclosed herein and that the two presently disclosed subsets of instructions can vary in detail per the present disclosure.
