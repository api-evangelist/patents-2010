This invention was made with Government support under Contract N00024 03 C 6110 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The disclosure relates to target tracking devices. More particularly the disclosure relates to a missile with a ranging bistatic RF seeker.

High velocity guided missiles are used for intercepting very fast targets such as ballistic rockets or highly maneuverable targets. Such missiles use a seeker to detect and guide the missile to the intended target.

Seeker missiles typically employ optical infrared IR radio frequency RF or multi mode seekers for detecting and guiding the missile toward the intended target. Multi mode seekers may employ both an IR and or optical seeker and a RF seeker for detecting and guiding the missile toward the intended target.

Existing multi mode seekers employ either an active RF seeker providing range and angle information for terminal guidance only or employ a bistatic RF seeker that is not cohered with an illuminator and therefore provides angle information only. Consequently existing multi mode seekers fail to provide range information over most or all of the intercept path which degrades their ability to detect and guide the missile toward the intended target.

Accordingly a seeker that provides the missile with ranging information offers the ability to resolve objects in range that are close in angle and the ability to measure object distance for improved detection and guidance of the missile to its intended target.

A seeker apparatus for a missile is disclosed herein. The apparatus includes a an RF antenna and a bistatic ranging detector operatively connected with the RF antenna. The RF antenna and bistatic ranging detector are operative for detecting one or more guidance objects in a RF band and providing angle and range data to the missile.

Further disclosed herein is a missile including a missile body a missile propulsion system disposed in or on the missile body and a ranging bistatic RF seeker disposed in or on the missile body.

Also disclosed herein is a method for detecting and guiding a missile to a targeted object. The method includes illuminating the target object with RF illumination produced by a source external to and cohered with the missile detecting RF illumination scattered by the targeted object with an RF seeker of the missile estimating a range between the missile and the targeted object with the RF seeker using illuminator position data missile position data missile attitude data targeted object delay data and target object angle data and guiding the missile to the targeted object using the estimated range data.

Still further disclosed herein is a method far detecting and guiding a missile to an object targeted in a cluster of objects. The method includes illuminating the objects with RF illumination produced by a source external to and cohered with the missile detecting RF illumination scattered by each of the objects with an RF seeker of the missile estimating a range between the missile and each of the objects with the RF seeker using illuminator position data missile position data missile attitude data and target object angle data and guiding the missile to a selected one of the objects in the cluster of objects based on the estimated ranges angles and rates the selected one of the objects being the targeted object.

The missile further includes a ranging bistatic RF seeker RF seeker formed by an RF seeker antenna a multi channel receiver and a bistatic ranging detector . The bistatic RF seeker detects the moving air borne targeted object or a cluster of moving air borne objects one of which is the targeted object in the RF band and provides angle and precision range data for object association and missile guidance. The RF seeker antenna is located in a forward tip of the missile behind a dome which is transparent to infrared and RF radiation. In other embodiments of the missile the dome may be omitted. The multi channel receiver is located in the missile body and has one or more inputs that are operatively coupled to one or more outputs of the RF seeker antenna and an output that is operatively coupled to an input of the bistatic ranging detector . As shown in the bistatic ranging detector in one embodiment includes a multi channel detector and a bistatic range estimator operatively coupled to an output of the multi channel detector .

An IR seeker can also be located in the forward tip of the missile behind the dome . The IR seeker is operatively coupled to an input of the RF seeker s multi channel receiver . The IR seeker detects the moving targeted object or the cluster of moving objects that includes the targeted object in the IR band and provides precision angle data for object association and missile guidance in conjunction with the ranging bistatic RF seeker. In other embodiments of the missile the IR seeker may be omitted.

An illuminator synched high precision clock or other coherent timing source can be included in the missile body of the missile and is operatively coupled to the input of the multi channel receiver . The illuminator synched clock provides the multi channel receiver with precision time delay data relating to one or more RF radar illuminators located remotely from the missile . In other embodiments the clock can be included in the RF seeker or be external to both the missile and RF seeker.

The missile can further include a GPS INS navigation system a global positioning system integrated with an inertial navigation system operatively coupled to the bistatic ranging detector . The navigation system in other embodiments can be included in the RF seeker or be external to both the missile and the RF seeker. The GPS INS navigation system provides the bistatic ranging detector with missile position and attitude data seeker navigation data . The bistatic range detector is constructed to generate RF seeker observed target object angles and RF seeker observed target object ranges. More specifically the multi channel detector of the bistatic range detector generates time synchronized detections i.e. target object delays and target object angles. The target object angles at the output of the multi channel detector are available at the output of the bistatic range detector for use in missile guidance and association. The bistatic range estimator of the bistatic range detector uses the time synchronized detections target delays and target angles at the output of the multi channel detector and the missile or seeker navigation data e.g. missile position velocity and or attitude at the output of the GPS INS navigation system to estimate target object ranges.

An RF communications antenna is located on or in the missile body of the missile . The RF communications antenna is operatively coupled to an RF uplink located in the missile body . The RF communications antenna receives target object map TOM data pertaining to the moving targeted object or the cluster of moving objects which includes the targeted object from a missile firing platform of the missile and or a Radar Command and Control System and the RF uplink uploads the object data TOM data to an operatively coupled association and selection logic ASL unit located in the missile body of the missile . The ASL unit is also operatively coupled to the input of the bistatic ranging detector and an input of the guidance and propulsion system . The ASL unit processes the object data received from the RF uplink and the estimated seeker angle and range data at the output of the bistatic ranging detector to associate by position and velocity the moving targeted object or the cluster of moving objects that includes the targeted object observed or detected by the RF seeker and the IR seeker if equipped with targeted object guidance data provided by the missile firing platform of the missile and or the Radar Command and Control System via the RF uplink and in the case of the cluster of objects selects a best one of the objects in the cluster i.e. the targeted object to intercept for input to the guidance and propulsion system .

Although the RF seeker equipped missile uses bistatic ranging in conjunction with some type of association logic to associate with an external TOM it should be understood that in other embodiments the RF seeker equipped missile can operate with just course guidance point and direction and without any external information.

Referring still to the RCCS directs the RF illuminator s to illuminate one or more air borne objects with remote RF radar illumination. The RF illuminators sense the RF illumination scattered by one or more objects in object cluster and communicate this radar data illuminator sensed radar data to the RCCS . The RCCS evaluates the illuminator sensed radar data and possibly data from other sensor assets not shown to produce targeted object guidance information for the missile . The RCCS communicates the targeted object guidance information to the RF seeker equipped missile and or the missile platform and then the RCCS and or the platform fires the missile . As the missile travels towards a targeted one of the objects in the cluster of objects the missile is cohered with the external illumination provided by first and second RF illuminators because the RCCS continuously sends updated targeted object guidance information to the missile . The missile receives and processes the targeted object guidance data and associates the cluster of objects observed or sensed by the RF seeker and optionally the IR seeker of the missile with the target object guidance data provided by the missile firing platform of the missile and or the Radar Command and Control System to select the best one of the objects in the object cluster the targeted object to intercept for input to the guidance and propulsion system of the missile .

The bistatic range calculations performed by the bistatic ranging detector of the RF seeker equipped missile will now be described with reference to the iso delay surface illustrated in . Given the following expressions 

The bistatic range data the estimated target object range data can then be used by the ASL unit along with the target object angle data and the object data TOM data to perform the earlier described association and guidance functions and select the best guidance object target object to hit for input to the guidance and propulsion system of the missile .

Thus the embodiments shall be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive and it should be understood that variations may be made in those embodiments by persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims that follow and their structural and functional equivalents.
