The present invention was made under Contract No. W911QX 04 C 0097 mod. no. P00001 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention relates to an electrostatic actuator apparatus and method and more particularly to a beta emission process of a source material emitting electrons which are then captured by a target material wherein electrical work is performed which in turn is transferred into mechanical work in the form of rotation of a rotor. Specific applications include a radioisotope fueled rotary actuator for micro and nano air vehicles employed as the main form of propulsion.

A nano air vehicle NAV is commonly defined as an air vehicle with a maximum dimension of 7.5 centimeters in any axis weighing 10 grams or less and capable of at least 20 minutes endurance and 1 kilometer range.

At this scale the aerodynamics and power are significant challenges. Multiple tradeoffs are involved. One approach to the challenges is to use lithium polymer batteries as part of the airframe. However these tend to change size as they are used impacting structure integrity. Another challenge is motor integration. Conventional fossil or battery powered motors are driven through gear mechanisms to turn a propeller or turbine. These designs impose severe range penalties have a high specific mass fraction of total air vehicle and endurance limitations which impact the overall ability to perform specific missions.

Propulsion of micro air vehicle MAV and NAV aircraft is traditionally affected through a conventional motor. The problem is that a motor either electrical usually DC or fossil fueled occupies a rather large portion of the vehicle mass fraction. Furthermore as the MAV NAV vehicle becomes more structurally efficient the percentage devoted to propulsion utilizing conventional technologies increases further implying an even harsher penalty in terms of payload due to propulsion requirements. Another significant drawback to conventional propulsion technology is implicit in the range capability of the vehicles. As the vehicles shrink in size the ability to carry fuel either electrical or fossil based enforces strict limits on overall endurance. Thus a vehicle which is capable of flight at just 30 knots is typically only capable of ranges 7 10 nautical miles. While this may be suitable for some applications under true operational constraints a significant increase in range is required in order to make the technology truly valuable to the user community.

Endurance is another area requiring improvement for MAV NAV devices. Present technological limits are in the 30 minute range as evident by the AeroVironment Black Widow design typical of high performance MAV s. The flight duration under optimal conditions significantly limits utility to the operator. AeroVironment is a registered trademark of the AeroVironment Inc. Corporation of California.

Radioisotope power systems RPS are employed in spacecraft. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators RTGs have been used to power for example pacemakers and spacecraft but are complex requiring the source material a walled container thermocouples and a heat sink to generate electricity. Nor is the energy produced by these compatible with the mass and volume constraints of MAV NAVs.

What is needed therefore are techniques for an actuator for micro scale vehicles that is efficient in power conversion providing sufficient power to generate lift and thrust at this small scale of flight.

Embodiments significantly reduce the mass fraction devoted to air vehicle propulsion and increase range and operation time for MAV NAV vehicles. Volumetric and electrical efficiencies are maximized to obtain an operational duration of 1 year for a propeller driven MAV design. The propulsion technique is directly applicable to all other types of micro and nano scale vehicles including ground and water conveyances including submersibles. Embodiment applications encompass new robotic devices including home products.

Through the use of radioisotopes as the fuel and designing the rotary actuator to take advantage of the intrinsically high operating voltage and resulting high rotational frequency direct drive is possible in embodiments. This eliminates the need for gearing and ancillary fuel storage containers. Therefore the mass fraction devoted to propulsion for the vehicle can be significantly altered such that an increase in payload is permissible. This increases the utility of the overall vehicle concept. Furthermore by using a radioisotope material with a sufficiently long half life the endurance and therefore the range can be significantly improved allowing the vehicle to fly great distances and loiter over the mission area for weeks to potentially months before returning to the home base. This is a more extensive hover and stare capability than currently available. For embodiments the radioisotope provides not only propulsive power but electrical power.

Embodiments of the present invention utilize a rotary actuator as a means of driving a conventional propeller for propulsion of the MAV NAV. The use of a radioisotope powers an EA at the MAV NAV scale at the power density level of 100 mW gm. Embodiments are scalable over a range of absolute powers and corresponding sizes. Furthermore by using a radioisotope to drive the actuator two significant improvements are enabled which dramatically change the MAV NAV paradigm. The first is a reduction in overall mass fraction of the air vehicle devoted to propulsion and the second is virtually unlimited range and endurance on the order of three months to a year in embodiments. Furthermore this technology is not limited to conventional air vehicle designs. The rotary actuator through a cam and follower motion transmission design can also drive unconventional flapping wing designs such as an ornithopter. Embodiments can also mimic the biomechanics of insect type devices to effect flight in a manner analogous to dragonflies and hummingbirds.

As mentioned additional applications include propulsion for micro submersible vehicles wherein the radioisotope provides not only propulsive power but electrical power to the vehicle. By virtue of elimination of combustion virtually unlimited range is available. Applications would not suffer from radiation emission safety hazards and so could avail themselves of more energetic sources. Other applications are NASA projects involving miniature robotic payloads which are keenly attuned to the needs for extremely low weight during launch and the desire for extremely long operation which is not necessarily afforded through conventional battery technology and solar charging circuits. Additional space applications include robotic devices which fly in an unconventional sense over a planetary surface and thus require both propulsion and extremely low weight.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

An actuator s source vanes rotate within an electric field between chutes walls generating torque. The principal which allows torque and power is the change in energy as a vane gets closer to the outer walls. The general equation is Torque d Energy d theta d C V 2 d theta . Hence the vane is attracted toward the narrow sections of the chutes . The energy is proportional to the volume of the actuator so large actuators will have more power and torque. Also energy is proportional to the E field squared hence in embodiments the E field is held close to the breakdown E field. The power is torque frequency so faster charging times and greater rotor RPM generate more power provided that the electrical current can charge the plates at the higher frequency.

Rotor actuator embodiments provide an electrical to mechanical power conversion and the upper limit of the mechanical power is a fraction of the electrical power which is Voltage Current. The larger the current the more power is generated. For radioisotopes this means a larger source disk will generate more power. Also for minimum size in embodiments the gap dimension is slightly larger than the threshold distance necessary to prohibit breakdown.

The rotor can be scaled in size for more power. Due to electrostatic breakdown arcing lightning the gap between the vane and the chute of the rotor will scale as the voltage is increased and the E field will be a constant. For example in embodiments the peak E field is at a value just below the threshold for arcing. As stated the power of the actuator scales as E field squared so it is beneficial to maintain high E fields.

A rotary actuator can have reasonably arbitrary spin RPM unlimited by mechanical resonant frequencies and hence can generate power just limited by the ability of the current to charge the plates.

The rotor can be charged by anything that generates high voltage. Examples are piezoelectric crystals or Van de Graff generators. It is not required that radioisotopes embedded into the spinning disk be the energy source. The charging source can be separate from the actuator.

For embodiments the number of source wedges is much larger than the number of chutes so that as one wedge is getting discharged at the throat end of the chute the torque is not disturbed for the next wedge. The wedge getting discharged is effectively at the chute voltage and hence the next wedge will be attracted to this discharged wedge which will not generate torque because the discharged wedge is on the same disk. For this reason in embodiments there is a throat section at the end of each chute which fully encapsulates the wedge getting discharged. Hence the next in line wedge always is closer to the chute walls during the discharge process and not closer to the discharging wedge.

Partial discharge can be used as a technique to keep the same power level at arbitrary RPM. With full discharge the RPM is limited by the time is takes to re charge the vanes. With partial discharge smaller currents are not required to waste time and energy charging up the vane capacitor to close to peak voltage. Almost all the torque is generated when the capacitance is near fully charged due to the E 2 dependence of the torque. Partial discharge can be implemented as a long RC time constant when the spinning wedge of the disk is shorted at the end of the chutes. It can also be implemented as a separate storage capacitor which quickly re charges the chute.

Disk rotor embodiments with a flat spinning disk have the advantage that they are mechanically robust. The flat spinning disk does not experience twist. However the charge closer to the inner radius is not as effectively generating torque as the charge on the outer radius of the disk. The charge on the inner radius of the disk is also more susceptible to arcing. Vertical wall embodiments have the advantage of more torque due to all the force being exerted at the farthest radius of the rotor. They are less susceptible to arcing because the vertical surface of the rotor sees the same large dimensions. They also have the advantage that the outer vertical walls of the disk can be tall and have more surface area and hence more torque. However mechanically they are a more 3 dimensional structure that needs to be more rigid due to the strain on the outer walls of the spinning disk.

Using radioisotopes a vacuum is employed in embodiments to allow the electrons or alpha particles to cross the gap between the spinning disk and the chutes. Without a vacuum electrons ionize the intervening gas not charging the capacitance. As shown by the standard Paschen Curve the pressure for millimeter size gaps or larger is much less than 1 1000th of an atmosphere. Pressures above 1 1000 atmosphere stop charge carriers. Pressures near 1 1000 atmosphere cause cascading ionization lightning . This vacuum constraint is not necessary for example if embedded radioisotopes are not used to charge the vanes and instead an external source is used.

Using radioisotopes about one third of the charge carriers make it across the gap and charge the plates. Since radioisotopes emit charged particles in random directions only one third have enough energy in the gap direction to bridge the high voltage across the gap contributing to efficiency considerations.

Electrostatic actuator design particulars follow. Beta emission characteristics are explained as power modes. For example operation life is highly dependent upon isotope selection. Embodiments provide weeks to months of useful life. Some embodiments may significantly extend this parameter. Rechargeable designs are included. For embodiments where only beta emission is employed candidate isotopes are considered. X ray emission can be a concern for some embodiments. However judicious choice of materials can limit this to manageable levels. Aluminum structure for example generates softer X ray spectrum than copper. Shielding is possible without significant impact to power density for light materials. For embodiments the beta emitter has the lowest atomic number with acceptable half life which decays into stable elements or maintains beta decay throughout the process. For some embodiments this eliminates materials such as Ru106 which decays into gamma emitter. For embodiments Sn123 is a gamma emitter which meets operational life and power density requirements. Embodiments demonstrate size power density frequency absolute power and stroke to support NAV size scale applications.

The embodiments depicted in first through fourth rotor embodiments in respectively and the table above have mechanical powers calculated for two different E fields 5.5e7 and 1.0e8 V m the second E field is double the first E field and the voltage is doubled as well . In embodiments the Power is four times larger when the voltage is doubled for any of these actuators because Power V 2. The two E fields were selected assuming that one of these would be an upper bound below which arcing occurs.

Embodiment case 4 disk rotor embodiment one is a noted case for comparison. It is the rotary actuator using 4 chutes and 24 source wedges. It achieves at a large E field a Power Mass of 2048 mW gm.

For rotary embodiments there is a limit to the number of source wedges that can be created around the source disk. The limit is caused by arcing considerations. At the throat of each chute where each source wedge is individually discharged there is now a voltage between the discharged source wedge and the neighboring un discharged source wedge. Hence there is a large E field and arcing considerations apply just as between the source wedges and the metal chutes. In embodiments this gap between source wedges may be free from material so that it is not conductive due to ionization.

An advantage of rotary embodiments is that they can operate at 500 Hz with no mechanical decelerations to overcome. However a bearing needs to be used in embodiments. For embodiments this bearing can be contained within a vacuum package and hence itself not require a vacuum seal.

For embodiment case 1 rotary embodiment four and case 2 rotary embodiment three the main torque during a full cycle occurs when the tip of the single source wedge gets close to the throat of the chute. This only occurs once each cycle when only one large source wedge is used. Embodiment case 3 rotary embodiment two overcomes this situation of case 2 by breaking the large single source wedge into 24 separate smaller source wedges. Now the main torque is occurring 24 times each cycle.

Case 2 also has another consideration. Torque is proportional to the change in the capacitance between the source wedge and metal chute as a function of angle. By using one large chute this slope in capacitance is very small over the first 70 of the cycle. Hence case 4 has 4 chutes to have this large slope region of the chute occur over a larger fraction of the cycle.

Finite element modeling FEM produced some results for capacitance v. rotation for 1 cm diameter embodiments. 1 More power is derived from more chutes. But an objective is to allow voltage to be high during the greatest slope of the capacitance. Hence embodiments can not have too many chutes. More power is achieved with more chutes to a limit. First the source wedges need to have enough source film to be able to fully charge each chute as it passing through it. Second the number of chutes should probably be half the number of source wedges in order for embodiments to optimize the torque on each source wedge.

2 The spiral smooth taper has a larger slope to the capacitance more torque compared to steps in a parallel plate design. The spiral chute embodiment has a larger change in the capacitance as a function of angle of the wedge source. The spiral also has less sharp corners to cause arcing.

3 For embodiments it is better to have a least twice as many source pieces than the number of chutes. This allows a steady torque to be applied and also allows more total capacitance. One source wedge can be experiencing the most torque near the throat of the chute and the other source wedge s can be in the charging stage. Basically in embodiments one does not get double the torque by having double the width of the source wedge because only the leading edge of the source wedge is experiencing the most torque.

For embodiments torque and power are optimized by optimizing the slope of C and allowing the voltage to be large. Just as Force dC dx V 2 the torque has the same type of formula Torque dC d angle V 2. Power for linear oscillations is Power Force velocity. Power for spinning motion is Power Torque angular velocity .

In plot for voltage versus rotation angle the voltage charges up from 0 to 60 degrees and peaks between 60 and 90 degrees. The voltage drops from 80 to 90 degrees because the gap in decreasing but the E field plot is still increasing. In this embodiment example the E field was limited to 5.5e7 V m. Nearly four times more power is possible if the E field is allowed to rise to 1e8 V m.

FEM can be used to optimize the complex capacitance versus rotation angle for embodiments. Maximize the number of chutes as the radioisotope current can charge in the shorter time frame. More radioisotope source wedges than chutes are employed in embodiments in order to generate smooth torque and to make full use of the charge time. The power is proportional to the spin rate as long as the film thickness can be increased to supply the extra needed current. Unlike a linear actuator without restoring spring rotary actuator embodiments can spin much faster than 100 Hz without having the electrostatic force compete with the mechanical accelerations. P33 and S35 isotopes are embodiment candidates when a maximum voltage of 50 kV is imposed. If 300 kV can be achieved without breakdown then P32 is a selection however P32 embodiments can require much metal to stop the electrons if only 50 kV is used.

Both alpha and gamma emitters were reconsidered. Embodiments achieve at least 50 mW gm at 1 year life. If operational life were to be restricted to 80 days or less pure beta emitters are feasible in embodiments. If operational life of 1 year is firm requirement Sn123 is an available candidate. Note that battery type actuators could provide a potential solution wherein the long life could be achieved through incremental replacement of radioisotope canister. Embodiments may also have manufacturing benefits as well.

For vertical wall rotor embodiment as in more torque should be provided for the same source material because the source material is all at a larger radius. For embodiments there is no advantage to stacking many motors to make double use of the target thickness. Hence the mass may be double the disk design when a stacked geometry is used. However as a stand alone motor embodiments power should exceed the source disk embodiments.

In embodiments current is small at 6 and 12 months. For embodiments the current is not large enough to support 375 Hz and get at least 40 kV. Embodiments can have a stroke approximately 20 mm and get 40 kV but the plate radius would need to be approximately 100 mm. Typically embodiments employ a minimum stroke distance which allows maximum E field at the running voltage but in this case the E field at 100 Hz never gets above 2.5e7 V m so embodiments increase stroke to improve voltage. Embodiments increase the full stroke from 3 to 6 mm to recover voltage. At higher frequencies embodiments employ advanced techniques to keep the voltage high partial discharge battery or storage capacitor. Partial discharge methods of operation are beneficial in embodiments in several ways and can result in an overall increase in actuator net power delivered.

Predicated upon beta electron emission and capture characteristics operation of parallel plate actuator embodiments employs high voltage in excess of 100 kV including a vacuum envelope. Operation of actuator embodiments at high voltage is feasible. Size is compatible with MAV NAV operation. Motion transfer with a vacuum envelope may include a magnetic clutch or direct link to actuator bellows for motion transfer. Getters may be used in embodiments to handle material outgassing in order to preserve vacuum qualities and operate at high voltage. Operational voltages for embodiments fall into the category of high voltage and may employ techniques in order to prevent arching. Embodiments can be fabricated using the 3 D Micro Electromagnetic Radio Frequency Systems 3D MERFS process. Motion transfer outside the vacuum envelope can be through cam and follower for rotary motor embodiments. In neither case is the operation at high voltage impeded through attachment of the connection mechanism.

The beta emission process comprises a source material emitting electrons which are then captured by a target material. During the release and capture process electrical work is performed which in turn is transferred into mechanical work in the form of rotation of the rotor.

For embodiments specific power was calculated using Sp fc m T Where Peak Beta Kinetic Energy m Atomic mass of the source T Half life of source material and fc Collection efficiency factor. This takes into account approximate energy spectrum and fixed collection voltage fc 0.073 held constant.

Ca45 is a contender for embodiments because the X ray energy is relatively low at 12 keV and the X rays are only generated 3 out of every million decays. Secondary X ray emission from the target metal plates and from surrounding support structures due to collisions with the beta particles might yield X rays of comparable energies and higher flux than Ca45. Hence for embodiments the target metal and additional structural metals need to be defined with regard to allowable X ray creation before the low flux Ca45 X ray is deemed a hazard or acceptable. Alpha particles can have large energy 1 MeV but still the penetration depth out of the source material is very limited. Hence the film thickness is very limited and the current is low. This low current results in low energy density. Another consideration is beta energy. The power of EA embodiments is largely driven by the maximum voltage force V and voltages less than 10 keV may not generate significant electrostatic force.

This distribution is shown in the figure. It is heavily weighted towards the lower energy end of the spectrum. From this distribution it may be determined that the average kinetic energy of a beta electron is approximately E 4.

from Eto eVwhere e is the electron charge. This collected energy normalized to E is a function of V normalized to E e. It has a maximum value of max 27 256 Eq. 7

at e V E 4 the mean kinetic energy of the beta electrons. Thus the optimal collection voltage is E 4 e . Assuming that there are N beta electron emitters per unit volume at their birth then the beta electron generation density G at the birth of the emitters is given by ln 2 Eq. 8

where T is the half life of the emitter. If all beta electrons are collected at the optimal voltage then the maximum power density Pthat can be obtained by collecting the electrons is given by max0.073 Eq. 9

The power generation density Pdivided by the mass density of the beta electron emitter is then the specific power Pof that emitter. The specific power is a useful metric for comparing different beta electron emitters. Since the mass density of the beta electron emitter is m N where m is the atomic mass of the emitter 0.073 Eq. 10

For some embodiments current multiplication methods may be applied. Secondary electron emission from metal plates is possible due to impact with beta electron. Solar cell analogy a radioisotope can excite electron hole pairs and induce a current source in the PIN junction. High voltages are not necessary and the kinetic energy of the beta electron is used to ionize thousands of atoms and create a current. The voltage is determined by placing many PIN junctions in series. Coil transformer from high impedance low current to low impedance high current analogy have a radioisotope capacitor in a vacuum and charge to the maximum voltage possible as determined by the isotope. Then discharge into a coil transformer at a very fast rate. A high current low voltage conversion might be possible in embodiments which could drive a low voltage electrostatic actuator or a motor.

Another source of secondary electrons besides collisions on the surface is Auger electrons. When the incident beta electron loses enough energy that its velocity is relatively slow but it still has a few keV of energy then the probability that the beta electron will excite a resonant energy level within the atoms goes up. The beta electron collides with an inner electron and ejects it creating a vacant inner shell. A valence electron then drops to the lower energy level to fill the vacant inner shell and in doing so transfers this resonant energy to another electron which then might escape from the target metal. Hence in embodiments we want the incident beta electrons to penetrate well beyond the surface of the target metal before they lose enough energy to excite these Auger electrons. This is another reason to allow the beta electrons to retain more than a few keV of kinetic energy before colliding with the target metal and is another reason to use light element target metals which have low resonance K shell energies. Hence the electron will penetrate deeper before exciting the Auger electrons. Auger electrons are used as a tool to identify or characterize elements within materials so they can be ejected from the surface of the material.

Values for Pare given in Table above. From the table it is apparent that for embodiments four beta electron emitters can meet the specific power requirements of 0.1 W gm when fabricated into an actuator. They are P32 P33 S35 and Ca45. However as mentioned above Ca45 is also a gamma emitter although at a very low level. Further P32 P33 and S35 meet the specifications with a sufficient margin to permit the likely fabrication of a practical actuator for 

Regarding conversion efficiency the optimal collection voltage is about the peak voltage and this allows approximately 0.3 of the beta electrons to cross the gap. This peak voltage yields the highest VI power product. If the voltage is higher then the current drops dramatically. The source film for embodiments needs to be about half the penetration depth in order to yield the maximum current. Hence some energy is lost as the beta electron escapes from the source film. The energy lost from half the penetration depth was assumed to be 30 not 50 because most energy is lost when the electrons are slower and have larger interaction times. The best case mass fraction for embodiments is 0.5. Half the mass is source material and half the mass is target material which is not radio active. The product of these four terms voltage fraction current fraction escape energy and best case mass ratio is 0.26. For Table Average VI power to Max VI instantaneous power 0.36 Average Mechanical Power to Average VI power 0.78 and Best Case fraction of total mass is source mass 0.5.

The graph also indicates an advantage of only using a beta decay energy that is just above the voltage that will be obtained in embodiments. Hence the metal target thickness will be at a minimum for the amount of energy it is stopping. For example if P32 is used without consideration of the stopping metal thickness and if the voltage is limited to 50 kV then significant metal hence added weight is included in embodiments without benefit. Since the rotary motor can run at 50 kV embodiments are candidates for materials such as P33 for example which is a choice from the current and energy perspective in embodiments.

The rotary actuator power can be restricted in embodiments if the maximum current from the isotope is weak and the rotary actuator can not spin very fast. Hence the rotary actuator is very good during the initial timeline of the decay within one half life .

For embodiments the maximum voltage using Sulfur 35 is probably limited to approximately 40 kV which means that the target metal can be the thinnest for the isotopes examined here. This is approximately of the maximum beta energy and is the optimal collection voltage. For embodiments Sulfur 35 can have a maximum source thickness of approximately 0.2 mm because the beta electrons need to be able to escape from the source material and the penetration depth of the beta electrons at the maximum 167 keV is only a little larger than 0.2 mm. Using an 87 day half life this 0.2 mm source thickness is enough to charge 4 times during a 100 Hz cycle hence there can be 4 chutes. For embodiments there also needs to be excess kinetic energy on the beta electron to be able to cross the voltage gap. Charge time should be relatively insensitive to the source wedge width because the capacitance increases proportional to the width. Hence if we have a limited current due to restricted film thickness due to 167 keV beta energy and longer half life half life of S35 is 87 days the charge time will be longer and embodiments are limited to only a few chutes or parallel plates. For S35 embodiments are limited to 4 chutes based on the limited current. Using 4 chutes Power Mass 300 mW gm.

Calcium 45 has similar behavior to Sulfur 35 except the beta energy is 258 keV instead of 167 keV and the half life is 162 days instead of 87 days. The film thickness can be 50 thicker due to the large beta energy but the total current will be around 0.75 the S35 current due to the factor of two longer half life. The current is enough to charge the capacitor 3 times during a 100 Hz cycle and hence there can be 3 chutes. In embodiments the optimal collection voltage can be 55 kV or a little larger instead of 40 kV for S35 which means more power but thicker target metal. Hence although the longer half life reduces the current by a factor of two the 30 or so larger voltage compensates for the reduced current. In this figure 50 kV is assumed regardless of source so S35 is assumed to charge to 50 kV instead of 40 kV and S35 has better Power Mass than Ca45. However if we incorporate the 40 kV voltage instead of 50 kV for S35 then Ca45 and S35 would have very close Power Mass. Using 3 chutes Power Mass 170 mW gm.

P33 has greater differences from Sulfur 35. The beta energy is 249 keV instead of 167 keV and the half life is 25 days instead of 87 days. For embodiments the film thickness can be 50 thicker due to the large beta energy and the half life is three times shorter hence the total current will be around four times larger than the S35 current. The current in embodiments is enough to charge the capacitor 16 times during a 100 Hz cycle and hence there can be 16 chutes. The optimal collection voltage can be 55 kV or a little larger instead of 40 kV for S35 which means more power but thicker target metal. For 16 chute embodiments by extending the curve the Power Mass 1000 mW gm.

P32 has the greatest differences from Sulfur 35. The beta energy is 1700 keV instead of 167 keV and the half life is 10 days instead of 87 days. The film thickness in embodiments can be eight times thicker due to the large beta energy and the half life is nine times shorter hence the total current will be around 70 times larger than the S35 current. The current is enough to charge the capacitor 280 times during a 100 Hz cycle and hence there can be 280 chutes and the voltage can go up to 400 kV.

Other considerations are applied next regarding power. If we just assume that the collection voltage can only be 50 kV based on breakdown then we only use the large beta energy to create large currents but we need very thick metal targets to trap the beta electrons 1.2 mm . If 16 chutes are implemented based on breakdown between source wedges then by extending the curve the Power Mass 400 mW gm. For embodiments P32 would be better than P33 if the actuator can be charged to more than 50 kV. In embodiments one benefit of the large film thickness is that the source material can be overstuffed and an adequate current can be generated for lifetimes 5 or 10 times larger 50 to 100 days than the element half life of 10 days.

In embodiments conversion from electrical to mechanical power is accomplished by direct magnetic coupling to the rotor through a vacuum housing. Once outside the housing a propeller is attached to the far side of the magnetic coupling for direct drive thus eliminating the losses through a mechanical gear box. The embodiment rotational frequency of the actuator can be adjusted to specifications the propeller such as diameter to optimize propulsion including efficiency.
