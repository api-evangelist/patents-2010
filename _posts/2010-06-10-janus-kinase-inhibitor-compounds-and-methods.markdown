Compounds of Formula I which are inhibitors of TYK2 kinase as well as compositions containing these compounds and methods of use including but not limited to in vitro in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells.

Cytokine pathways mediate a broad range of biological functions including many aspects of inflammation and immunity Janus kinases JAK including JAK1 JAK2 JAK3 and TYK2 are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets Schindler et al. 2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282 20059 63 . JAK1 JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers and as a result more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence.

JAK1 was initially identified in a screen for novel kinases Wilks A. F. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 1603 1607 . Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon e.g. IFNalpha type II interferon e.g. IFNgamma IL 2 and IL 6 cytokine receptor complexes Kisseleva et al. 2002 gene 285 1 24 Levy et al. 2005 Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 651 662 O Shea et al. 2002 Cell 109 suppl. S121 S131 . JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling Kisseleva et al. 2002 gene 285 1 24 O Shea et al. 2002 Cell 109 suppl. S121 S131 . Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN IL 10 IL 2 IL 4 and IL 6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL 6 pathway Tocilizumab was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis Scheinecker et al. 2009 Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8 273 274 .

Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single chain e.g. EPO IL 3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families Kisseleva et al. 2002 gene 285 1 24 Levy et al. 2005 Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 651 662 O Shea et al. 2002 Cell 109 suppl. S121 S131 . Consistent with this JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia O Shea et al. 2002 Cell 109 suppl. S121 S131 . Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 e.g. JAK2 V617F are associated with myeloproliferative disorders MPDS in humans.

JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain which is present in the IL 2 IL 4 IL 7 IL 9 IL 15 and IL 21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency SCID O Shea et al. 2002 Cell 109 suppl. S121 S131 . Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes JAK3 and JAK3 mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications e.g. transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis Baslund et al. 2005 Arthritis Rheumatism 52 2686 2692 Changelian et al. 2003 Science 302 875 878 .

TYK2 associates with the type I interferon e.g. IFNalpha IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 and IL 23 cytokine receptor complexes Kisseleva et al. 2002 gene 285 1 24 Watford W. T. O Shea J. J. 2006 Immunity 25 695 697 . Consistent with this primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 and IL 23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL 12 and Il 23 cytokines Ustekinumab was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis Krueger et al. 2007 N. Engl. J. Med. 356 580 92 Reich et al. 2009 Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8 355 356 . In addition an antibody targeting the IL 12 and IL 23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn s Disease Mannon et al. 2004 N. Engl. J. Med. 351 2069 79 .

 Treat and treatment includes both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen an undesired physiological change or disorder such as the development or spread of cancer or inflammation. For purposes of this invention beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state remission and sustaining remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder for example through a genetic mutation or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.

The phrase therapeutically effective amount means an amount of a compound of the present invention that i treats or prevents the particular disease condition or disorder ii attenuates ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder or iii prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer.

To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy can for example be measured by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR . In the case of immunological disease the therapeutic effective amount is an amount sufficient to decrease or alleviate an allergic disorder the symptoms of an autoimmune and or inflammatory disease e.g. psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease or the symptoms of an acute inflammatory reaction e.g. asthma . In some embodiments a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity or number of B cells.

The term bioavailability refers to the systemic availability i.e. blood plasma levels of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time rate and total amount extent of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.

 Inflammatory disorder as used herein can refer to any disease disorder or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms host tissue damage or loss of tissue function. Inflammatory disorder also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes and or neutrophil chemotaxis.

 Inflammation as used herein refers to a localized protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues which serves to destroy dilute or wall off sequester both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes and or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke immune response to foreign antigen and autoimmune responses. Accordingly inflammatory disorders amenable to treatment with Formula I compounds encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system.

 Specific defense system refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens autoimmune diseases and delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs e.g. kidney and bone marrow transplants and graft versus host disease GVHD are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.

The term nonspecific defense system as used herein refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory e.g. granulocytes and macrophages . Examples of inflammation that result at least in part from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS or multiple organ injury syndromes reperfusion injury acute glomerulonephritis reactive arthritis dermatoses with acute inflammatory components acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke thermal injury inflammatory bowel disease granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes and cytokine induced toxicity.

 Autoimmune disease as used herein refers to any group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell mediated responses to the body s own constituents.

 Allergic disease as used herein refers to any symptoms tissue damage or loss of tissue function resulting from allergy. Arthritic disease as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies. Dermatitis as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies. Transplant rejection as used herein refers to any immune reaction directed against grafted tissue such as organs or cells e.g. bone marrow characterized by a loss of function of the grafted and surrounding tissues pain swelling leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. The therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation.

 Inflammatory cell activation refers to the induction by a stimulus including but not limited to cytokines antigens or auto antibodies of a proliferative cellular response the production of soluble mediators including but not limited to cytokines oxygen radicals enzymes prostanoids or vasoactive amines or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators including but not limited to major histocompatability antigens or cell adhesion molecules in inflammatory cells including but not limited to monocytes macrophages T lymphocytes B lymphocytes granulocytes i.e. polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils basophils and eosinophils mast cells dendritic cells Langerhans cells and endothelial cells . It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation perpetuation or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder.

The term NSAID is an acronym for non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic antipyretic lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness and in higher doses with anti inflammatory effects reducing inflammation . The term non steroidal is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids which among a broad range of other effects have a similar eicosanoid depressing anti inflammatory action. As analgesics NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory arthropathies e.g. ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis Reiter s syndrome acute gout dysmenorrhoea metastatic bone pain headache and migraine postoperative pain mild to moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury pyrexia ileus and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase 1 COX 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A . Prostaglandins act among other things as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. COX 2 inhibitors include celecoxib etoricoxib lumiracoxib parecoxib rofecoxib rofecoxib and valdecoxib.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A tumor comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

The term prodrug as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less efficacious to the patient or cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See e.g. Wilman Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy Biochemical Society Transactions 14 pp. 375 382 615th Meeting Belfast 1986 and Stella et al. Prodrugs A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery Borchardt et al. ed. pp. 247 267 Humana Press 1985 . The prodrugs of this invention include but are not limited to phosphate containing prodrugs thiophosphate containing prodrugs sulfate containing prodrugs peptide containing prodrugs D amino acid modified prodrugs glycosylated prodrugs lactam containing prodrugs optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide containing prodrugs 5 fluorocytosine and other 5 fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include but are not limited to those chemotherapeutic agents described above.

 Liposome refers to a vesicle composed of one or more lipids phospholipids and or surfactants which is useful for delivery of a drug such as a compound of Formula I and optionally a chemotherapeutic agent to a mammal. The components of the liposome can be in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include diastereomers enantiomers conformers and the like.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of Formulas I VII. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of Formulas I VII. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.

The term protecting group or Pg refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example an amino protecting group is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino protecting groups include acetyl trifluoroacetyl phthalimido t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl Fmoc . Similarly a hydroxy protecting group refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxy protecting groups include acetyl trialkylsilyl dialkylphenylsilyl benzoyl benzyl benzyloxymethyl methyl methoxymethyl triarylmethyl and tetrahydropyranyl. A carboxy protecting group refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy protecting groups include CHCHSOPh cyanoethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethoxymethyl 2 p toluenesulfonyl ethyl 2 p nitrophenylsulfenyl ethyl 2 diphenylphosphino ethyl nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene and P. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Third Ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1999 and P. Kocienski Protecting Groups Third Ed. Verlag 2003.

The term patient includes human patients and animal patients. The term animal includes companion animals e.g. dogs cats and horses food source animals zoo animals marine animals birds and other similar animal species.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

The terms compound of this invention and compounds of the present invention and compounds of Formulas I compounds of Formulas I VII unless otherwise indicated include compounds of Formula I IIa IIb IIc IId IIe IIf IIg IIh IIi IIj Ilk IIl IIIa IIIb IIIc IIId IIIe IIIf IVa IVb V Va Vb VIa VIIb VIIc VIId VIIa VIIb VIIc and or VIId and stereoisomers tautomers solvates metabolites salts e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. Unless otherwise stated structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example compounds of Formula I IIa IIb IIc IId IIe IIf IIg IIh IIi IIj IIk IIl IIIa IIIb IIIc IIId IIIe IIIf IVa IVb V Va VIa VIIb VIIc VIId VIIa VIIb VIIc and or VIId wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced deuterium or tritium or one or more carbon atoms are replaced by a C or C enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.

The compounds of Formulas I VII may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formulas I VII including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. In addition the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example if a compound of Formulas I VII incorporates a double bond or a fused ring both the cis and trans forms as well as mixtures are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers e.g. resulting from the N oxidation of the pyrimidinyl and pyrrozolyl rings or the E and Z forms of compounds of Formulas I VII for example oxime moieties are also within the scope of the present invention.

In the structures shown herein where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like and it is intended that the invention as defined by the claims embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.

In an embodiment compounds of Formulas I VII may exist in different tautomeric forms and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of Formulas I VII which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of Formulas I VII include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N N O O O P P S F Cl I and I respectively. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of Formulas I VII e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O N C and F are useful for positron emission tomography PET studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formulas I VII can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples herein below by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formulas I VII enantiomers diasteriomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

In the preparation of compounds of the present invention protection of remote functionality e.g. primary or secondary amine of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino protecting groups NH Pg include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl Fmoc . The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis John Wiley Sons New York 1991.

The iodide group in the amide 2 3 can then be converted to many other functional groups using chemistry known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example the iodide 2 3 can be converted to the nitrile 2 4 by reacting with cuprous cyanide in DMF.

The acid chloride 2 2 is subsequently coupled to a heteroarylamine 5 1 for example 4 aminopyridine or 4 aminopyrimidine in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride to give amide 6 1 . The iodide group in the amide 6 1 can then be converted to many other functional groups using chemistry known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example the iodide 6 1 can be converted to the nitrile 6 2 by reacting with cuprous cyanide in DMF. The iodide 6 1 can also be coupled to a borate or a boronic acid via palladium catalyzed Suzuki reaction to give a variety of different compounds 6 3 .

The amide 7 1 can be converted to amines 7 3 via a palladium catalyzed Buchwald coupling reaction. In a similar manner amides 7 1 can be coupled to an amides via palladium catalyzed Buchwald coupling reaction to give products such as 7 4 .

It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist compounds of various formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation substitution oxidation reduction or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation arylation heteroarylation acylation sulfonylation halogenation nitration formylation and coupling procedures.

In a further example primary amine or secondary amine groups may be converted into amide groups NHCOR or NRCOR by acylation. Acylation may be achieved by reaction with an appropriate acid chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or by reaction with an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such HATU O 7 azabenzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Similarly amine groups may be converted into sulphonamide groups NHSOR or NR SOR groups by reaction with an appropriate sulphonyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Primary or secondary amine groups can be converted into urea groups NHCONR R or NRCONR R by reaction with an appropriate isocyanate in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.

An amine e.g. NH may be obtained by reduction of a nitro NO group for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or an alcohol e.g. methanol. Alternatively the transformation may be carried out by chemical reduction using for example a metal e.g. tin or iron in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid.

In a further example amine CHNH groups may be obtained by reduction of nitriles CN for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst for example palladium on a support such as carbon or Raney nickel in a solvent such as an ether e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran at an appropriate temperature for example from about 78 C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent.

In a further example amine NH groups may be obtained from carboxylic acid groups COH by conversion to the corresponding acyl azide CON Curtius rearrangement and hydrolysis of the resultant isocyanate N C O .

Aldehyde groups CHO may be converted to amine groups CHNR R by reductive amination employing an amine and a borohydride for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon for example dichloromethane or an alcohol such as ethanol where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid at around ambient temperature.

In a further example aldehyde groups may be converted into alkenyl groups CH CHR by the use of a Wittig or Wadsworth Emmons reaction using an appropriate phosphorane or phosphonate under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art.

Aldehyde groups may be obtained by reduction of ester groups such as COEt or nitriles CN using diisobutylaluminium hydride in a suitable solvent such as toluene. Alternatively aldehyde groups may be obtained by the oxidation of alcohol groups using any suitable oxidising agent known to those skilled in the art.

Ester groups COR may be converted into the corresponding acid group COH by acid or base catalused hydrolysis depending on the nature of R. If R is t butyl acid catalysed hydrolysis can be achieved for example by treatment with an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in an aqueous solvent or by treatment with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid in an aqueous solvent.

Carboxylic acid groups COH may be converted into amides CONHR or CONR R by reaction with an appropriate amine in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as HATU in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.

In a further example carboxylic acids may be homologated by one carbon i.e COH to CHCOH by conversion to the corresponding acid chloride COCl followed by Arndt Eistert synthesis.

In a further example OH groups may be generated from the corresponding ester e.g. COR or aldehyde CHO by reduction using for example a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. Alternatively an alcohol may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding acid COH using for example lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or by using borane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.

Alcohol groups may be converted into leaving groups such as halogen atoms or sulfonyloxy groups such as an alkylsulfonyloxy e.g. trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy e.g. p toluenesulfonyloxy group using conditions known to those skilled in the art. For example an alcohol may be reacted with thioyl chloride in a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane to yield the corresponding chloride. A base e.g. triethylamine may also be used in the reaction.

In another example alcohol phenol or amide groups may be alkylated by coupling a phenol or amide with an alcohol in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl diisopropyl or dimethylazodicarboxylate. Alternatively alkylation may be achieved by deprotonation using a suitable base e.g. sodium hydride followed by subsequent addition of an alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide.

Aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen metal exchange by treatment with a base for example a lithium base such as n butyl or t butyl lithium optionally at a low temperature e.g. around 78 C. in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus for example a formyl group may be introduced by using N N dimethylformamide as the electrophile. Aromatic halogen substituents may alternatively be subjected to metal e.g. palladium or copper catalysed reactions to introduce for example acid ester cyano amide aryl heteraryl alkenyl alkynyl thio or amino substituents. Suitable procedures which may be employed include those described by Heck Suzuki Stille Buchwald or Hartwig.

Aromatic halogen substituents may also undergo nucleophilic displacement following reaction with an appropriate nucleophile such as an amine or an alcohol. Advantageously such a reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of microwave irradiation.

In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.

Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product unreacted starting material reaction by product or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon molecular sieves ion exchange media or the like. Alternatively the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material bases in the case of an acidic material binding reagents such as antibodies binding proteins selective chelators such as crown ethers liquid liquid ion extraction reagents LIX or the like.

Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereoisomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. 113 3 283 302 1975 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair Eliel E. and Wilen S. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob 47 4165 1982 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York 1989 Okamoto . 513 375 378 1990 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

Positional isomers for example E and Z forms of compounds of Formulas I VII and intermediates for their synthesis may be observed by characterization methods such as NMR and analytical HPLC. For certain compounds where the energy barrier for interconversion is sufficiently high the E and Z isomers may be separated for example by preparatory HPLC.

Evaluation of drug induced immunosuppression by the compounds of the invention may be performed using in vivo functional tests such as rodent models of induced arthritis and therapeutic or prophylactic treatment to assess disease score T cell dependent antibody response TDAR and delayed type hypersensitivity DTH . Other in vivo systems including murine models of host defense against infections or tumor resistance Burleson G R Dean J H and Munson A E. Vol. 1. Wiley Liss New York 1995 may be considered to elucidate the nature or mechanisms of observed immunosuppression. The in vivo test systems can be complemented by well established in vitro or ex vivo functional assays for the assessment of immune competence.

Collagen Induced Arthritis CIA 6 week detailed study using an autoimmune mechanism to mimic human arthritis rat and mouse models Example 68 . Collagen induced arthritis CIA is one of the most commonly used animal models of human rheumatoid arthritis RA . Joint inflammation which develops in animals with CIA strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with RA. Blocking tumor necrosis factor TNF is an efficacious treatment of CIA just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T cells and antibodies B cells . Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development. CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund s Adjuvant CFA . It is most commonly induced in the DBA 1 mouse strain but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats.

There is good evidence that B cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and or inflammatory disease. Protein based therapeutics that deplete B cells such as Rituxan are effective against autoantibody driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis Rastetter et al. 2004 Annu Rev Med 55 477 . CD69 is the early activation marker in leukocytes including T cells thymocytes B cells NK cells neutrophils and eosinophils. The CD69 human whole blood assay Example 69 determines the ability of compounds to inhibit the production of CD69 by B lymphocytes in human whole blood activated by crosslinking surface IgM with goat F ab anti human IgM.

The T cell Dependent Antibody Response TDAR is a predictive assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM Plaque Forming Cell PFC assay using Sheep Red Blood Cells SRBC as the antigen is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test. TDAR has proven to be a highly predictable assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US National Toxicology Program NTP database M. I. Luster et al 1992 Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18 200 210 . The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments 1 antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells 2 T helper cells which are critical players in the genesis of the response as well as in isotype switching and 3 B cells which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR M. P. Holsapple In G. R. Burleson J. H. Dean and A. E. Munson Editors Volume 1 Wiley Liss Publishers New York N.Y. 1995 pp. 71 108 . Usually this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody R. J. Smialowizc et al 2001 Toxicol. Sci. 61 164 175 or as a plaque or antibody forming cell assay L. Guo et al 2002 Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181 219 227 to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells e.g. sheep erythrocytes or soluble protein antigens T. Miller et al 1998 Toxicol. Sci. 42 129 135 .

Pharmaceutical formulations of a compound of Formulas I VII may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. A compound of Formulas I VII having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 1980 16th edition Osol A. Ed. in the form of a lyophilized formulation milled powder or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH and at the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers i.e. carriers that are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.

In an embodiment the compound of Formulas I VII for use in a pharmaceutical composition is substantially sterile. The compound ordinarily will be stored as a solid composition although lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions are acceptable.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion i.e. amounts concentrations schedules course vehicles and route of administration consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The therapeutically effective amount of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent ameliorate or treat the disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host.

As a general proposition the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01 100 mg kg namely about 0.1 to 20 mg kg of patient body weight per day with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg kg day.

Acceptable diluents carriers excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. . Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Formulations of a compound of Formulas I VII suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the compound of Formulas I VII.

Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder lubricant inert diluent preservative surface active or dispersing agent.

These excipients may be for example inert diluents such as calcium or sodium carbonate lactose calcium or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents such as maize starch or alginic acid binding agents such as starch gelatin or acacia and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.

For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient s in an amount of for example 0.075 to 20 w w. When formulated in an ointment the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water miscible ointment base. Alternatively the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil in water cream base.

If desired the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol butane 1 3 diol mannitol sorbitol glycerol and polyethylene glycol including PEG 400 and mixtures thereof.

The pharmaceutical composition of a compound of Formulas I VII may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1 3 butane diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.

The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example a time release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 of the total compositions weight weight . The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 g of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL hr can occur.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants buffers bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.

Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of HIV infections as described below.

Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

The formulations may be packaged in unit dose or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose as herein above recited or an appropriate fraction thereof of the active ingredient.

These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally orally or by any other desired route.

The compounds of Formulas I VII may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein such as an immunologic disorder e.g. psoriasis or inflammation or a hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . In certain embodiments a compound of Formulas I VII is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second therapeutic compound that has anti inflammatory or anti hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating an inflammation immune response disorder or hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . The second therapeutic agent may be a NSAID or other anti inflammatory agent. The second therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formulas I VII such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formulas I VII or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in combination with a therapeutic agent such as an NSAID.

Another embodiment therefore includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase in a patient comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulas I VII and further comprising administering a second therapeutic agent.

The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.
