The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to aeronautics. More particularly the invention relates to aircraft structure and load accommodation. The invention also relates to cargo loading or discharging particularly releasable externally mounted cargo.

Suspension slings are used for suspending a cargo load below an aircraft during flight. Loads are typically attached to a helicopter with a sling suspension attached to structurally strengthened hard points on the under surface of the fuselage. There is substantial benefit when jettisoning load for suspension from a single cable. Dropping or jettisoning cargo is inherently more balanced because it is accomplished by opening a single attachment hook. However a single cable system produces an undistributed point load on the aircraft resulting in instability problems. At speeds greater than low speeds a load will twist on a single cable to a position broadside to the direction of flight. Flight with the widest area facing the direction of flight induces yawing of the load. As a result the pilot must limit aircraft speed to approximately 50 knots to reduce instability in the aircraft.

In order to overcome the single cable load yawing loads have been suspended from two or more cables. It has been found that this reduces aerodynamically induced load yawing at lower speeds but yawing resumes at higher speeds. Two or more suspension cables are used for low speed flight but produce instability at higher speeds of 120 knots or more. Aircraft turns may initiate instability at any aircraft speed especially at higher speeds.

In order to use the capability speed of aircraft there a need for an attachment apparatus that provides stable suspension of externally mounted cargo loads at higher air speeds.

An aircraft is configured with four or more structurally strengthened hard points for engagement of hard point attachment means. Elongated attachment slings attach the cargo suspension apparatus to the hard point attachment means.

The cargo suspension apparatus comprises an upper rigid frame and a lower rigid frame. The lower frame is geometrically similar and dimensionally smaller that the upper frame.

V shaped slings connect the upper frame with the lower frame and suspend the lower frame therebelow. The lower frame has load attachment means. A load such as a cargo receiving holder is attached to the lower rigid frame.

The invention is described with reference to the drawing wherein numerals in the written description correspond to like numbered elements in the figures. The drawing discloses a preferred embodiment of the invention and is not intended to limit the generally broad scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.

Reference is made to in which the horizontal and vertical axes are labeled x and y. This is a side view so the z axis is not seen in this view as it is seen in . An Osprey V 22 tilt rotor aircraft is in transition from vertical flight to horizontal flight. Transition is accomplished by means of aircraft engine which drives propellers and is tilted to provide propulsion in a direction indicated by arrow . Arrow includes components along both the horizontal x axis and the vertical y axis. Forward is labeled FWD and aft is labeled AFT on aircraft . The forward and aft labeling also extends to the load suspension apparatus and to the load .

The reported suspended cargo carrying capacity for the Osprey V 22 is 10 000 to 15 000 pounds. An external cargo load suspended beneath a tilt rotor aircraft or a helicopter is susceptible to aerodynamic instability. This instability can be transmitted through the cargo suspension apparatus to the aircraft. The cargo suspension apparatus of the invention allows for aerodynamic movement of the cargo and compensation for that movement with V shaped slings. Dynamic moments are opposed and compensated in the suspension apparatus with reduced transmission of dynamic moments to the aircraft.

Packaged cargo load is suspended from aircraft by a load suspension apparatus attached to the underside of the aircraft fuselage . Load suspension apparatus is joined to aircraft by means of aircraft attachment slings and . The Osprey V 22 aircraft is exemplary of an aircraft that is sensitive to destabilizing by a suspended cargo load and therefore benefits from use of the cargo suspension frame of the invention. The invention was discovered while investigating stable suspension systems for the Osprey V 22 tilt rotor aircraft and its use with this aircraft is the Best Mode contemplated by the inventors. Because of the enhanced load stability use with an aircraft such as a helicopter will also enhance load stability.

Military aircraft ordinarily have structurally strengthened hard points in the airframe or attached to the airframe for the attachment of external loads and for ground and shipboard tie down. A hard point can be configured to mount a hook for releasable fastening of a cargo cable cargo net cargo sling and the like. Helicopters and the V 22 Osprey aircraft have structurally strengthened hard points spaced forward and aft on the underside of the fuselage. The invention requires at least four spaced structurally strengthened hard points. The V 22 Osprey has tie down points attached to the airframe on the underside of the fuselage. These tie down points are structurally strengthened hard points and are useful for attachment of the cargo suspension apparatus of the invention. Helicopters also have similar tie down points.

In load suspension apparatus has an upper rigid frame of rectangular configuration shown horizontally positioned just below the fuselage underside . Also associated with the load suspension apparatus is a lower rigid frame of a similar rectangular geometrical configuration but of smaller dimensions. A lower rigid frame is shown positioned horizontally below the upper rigid frame . Frame and frame share the general forward FWD and aft AFT orientation of aircraft . The forward end is defined by forward end bar and forward end bar . The aft end is defined by aft end bar and aft end bar

Upper rigid frame is formed from a pair of parallel spaced side bars connected by a forward end bar and an aft end bar . The side bars are attached to forward end bar at attachment point and at opposing attachment point . The side bars are attached to aft end bar at attachment point and at opposing attachment point

Lower rigid frame is formed from a pair of parallel spaced side bars connected by a forward end bar and an aft end bar . The lower side bars are attached to forward end bar at attachment point and at opposing attachment point . The side bars are attached to aft end bar at attachment point and at opposing attachment point

In it is clear that frame and frame are geometrically similar. Frame has smaller dimensions. Smaller dimensions means that side bars are shorter than side bars . In the alternative smaller dimensions means that forward end bar and aft end bar are shorter than forward end bar and aft end bar . In another alternative smaller dimensions means that each of and is shorter than the corresponding and as shown in . The lower frame forms the top of a cargo holder within which the load is contained as shown in .

The V 22 Osprey aircraft external fuselage length is about 57.33 feet and width is about 84.6 feet. Typical dimensions for the load suspension frame of the invention for use with this aircraft are as follows 

A cargo holder may be attached to lower frame . In the alternative lower frame may be integrally connected with a cargo container. In another alternative an aerodynamically irregularly shaped load such a vehicle can be attached to lower frame with cargo straps. The optimum stability of the cargo suspension frame is achieved by limiting cargo load to dimensions less than the dimensions of the aircraft structurally strengthened hard points.

Materials of construction for cargo suspension frames is well known in the industry. Aircraft aluminum or aerospace aluminum usually refers to 7075 aluminum a zinc and copper alloy. Aircraft aluminum also includes 6061 aluminum 6063 aluminum 2024 aluminum and 5052 aluminum. Frames are made of aircraft specification aluminum alloy brackets or tubing. The bracket or tubing material is selected to carry the weight lifted with an allowance for safety.

In three orthogonal axes are labeled x y and z. These axes are consistent with the axes shown in and consistent with the forward FWD and aft AFT labeling. In and an elongated aircraft attachment sling is mounted on the forward and aft frame end bars and . Elongated aircraft sling has a slot at the upper end for reception of a hook attached to a hard point on the underside of aircraft . Elongated aircraft slings are also mounted on the frame side bars . Each of the elongated aircraft slings has a slot formed in the upper end thereof for reception of a hook on hook attachment bracket connected by a bolt to a hard point on the fuselage underside . Attached to the aircraft frame are four spaced structurally strengthened hard points on the fuselage underside including hook attachment brackets respectively attached to the aircraft for suspension of frame from the fuselage underside at four locations established by the elongated aircraft slings and .

As described above the suspension apparatus includes a lower rigid frame of a similar rectangular geometrical configuration as the upper frame but of smaller dimension. That is the corresponding members of the rectangle are shorter. Lower rigid frame includes forward end bar aft end bar and two side bars . Upper rigid frame includes forward end bar aft end bar and two side bars .

The term V shaped sling means a sling having three attachment points The three attachment points correspond with the three vertexes of a triangle. Sling material usually comprises only two legs of a triangle. A third leg as seen in need not be present. Although the third leg is not present the slings may be referred to as triangulated slings. Because of the three attachment points the visual impression is of a V shaped or triangulated sling. In the alternative the V shaped sling can include the three legs of a triangle.

V shaped slings and are attached at a forward end to one of two corner attachment points on the upper frame and at an aft end to a diagonal corner attachment point on the upper frame. The V shaped sling is also attached at an intermediate point to the lower frame at one of two points. One point is on the same end and the opposing side on the lower frame. The other intermediate point on the lower frame is on the opposite end and non opposing side.

The lower frame is suspended from the upper frame by a minimum of four flexible V shaped slings. The V shaped slings are connected as follows 

 a. V shaped sling is attached at a forward end to attachment point at an intermediate point to attachment point and at an aft end to attachment point

 b. V shaped sling is attached at a forward end to attachment point at an intermediate point to attachment point and at an aft end to attachment point

 c. V shaped sling is attached at a forward end to attachment point at an intermediate point to attachment point and at an aft end to attachment point

 d. V shaped sling is attached at a forward end to attachment point at an intermediate point to attachment point and at an aft end to attachment point

Each attachment point on the upper frame is connected to its diagonal attachment point on the upper frame with two V shaped slings. Each of the two V shaped slings transits the load suspension apparatus differently. One transit by the sling is by diagonal intermediate attachment at the same end to the opposing attachment point on the lower frame end bar. The other transit is by intermediate attachment at the opposite end to the non opposing attachment point on the lower frame end bar. Both transits form a diagonal from the upper frame to the lower frame. The result is a series of diagonal crossings between the upper frame and the lower frame. The diagonal crossings form triangles. The crossed V shaped slings dynamically stabilize suspended loads from lateral forces in all lateral directions. Inverted V shaped slings are functionally equivalent.

By virtue of the foregoing described light weight arrangement of the load suspension device increased restraint and stability is provided for the cargo load . The upper rectangular frame enables use of distributed structurally strengthened hard points for suspension by the aircraft attachment slings and from the fuselage underside while the attachments of the V shaped slings and at the opposite frame ends and provides for enhanced stabilized suspension of the load therebelow. Furthermore the configuration of the load suspension apparatus allows for normal operation of the aircraft when no load is attached. Also the sling attachments including hook and attachment bracket on the aircraft underside allow jettisoned release of the suspension slings.

Materials of construction of aircraft cargo slings are well known in the industry. Slings are made of nylon and polyester web material in widths of 1 inch to 12 inches typically 1 inch to 6 inches. The slings have strength in the range of 7500 lb inch to 9800 lb inch MIL W 4088 MIL W 27265 . Materials are sold under trade names including Nomex Vectran Cordura Kevlar and Spectra . In the alternative aircraft attachment slings and and V shaped slings and may be made from conventional aircraft cargo slings cables or ropes.

Means for attaching cargo slings to aluminum frames are well known and commercially available. The structurally strengthened hard points on the aircraft are equipped with releasable cargo hooks for air drop of a load. Hooks are attached to the elongated aircraft attachment slings through a slot in the cargo sling. The slot is reinforced with sewing to form an eyelet. The slot may further be reinforced with metal or plastic inserts. The term hard point attachment means is intended to include hooks and all functional equivalents such as clips eyelets and the like.

The aircraft attachment slings and the V shaped slings are fabricated by a sewing to form a sewn connection loop. Other connectors including buckles latches and swiveling connectors are available for use with cargo slings.

According to other embodiments of the invention the rectangular configuration of the upper and lower frames and may be replaced for example by circular elliptical or greater than four sided polygonal configurations.
