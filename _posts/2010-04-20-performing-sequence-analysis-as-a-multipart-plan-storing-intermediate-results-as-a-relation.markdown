title: Performing sequence analysis as a multipart plan storing intermediate results as a relation
abstract: A usage model and the underlying technology used to provide sequence analysis as part of a relational database system. Included components include the semantic and syntactic integration of the sequence analysis with an existing query language, the storage methods for the sequence data, and the design of a multipart execution scheme that runs the sequence analysis as part of a potentially larger database query, especially using parallel execution techniques.
