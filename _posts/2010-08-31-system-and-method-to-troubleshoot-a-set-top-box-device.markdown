Referring to a first graphical diagram of set top box device failures is depicted and generally designated . The first graphical diagram shows how a double crash within a short period of time may be indicative of a problem with a set top box digital video recorder based on an eligible population of set top box devices.

When two crash events occur at a set top box device within a predetermined period of time e.g. three days a monitoring center e.g. the monitoring center of the monitoring center of and the monitoring center of may automatically determine that the set top box device has failed.

The service delivery platform server may provide the media content to subscribers via the backbone network . For example the service delivery platform server may enable a service provider to encode the various types of programming to a particular standard such as H.264. The service delivery platform server may enable a service provider to encrypt the various type of programming using a digital rights management scheme. The service delivery platform server may store data associated with each set top box device that is serviced by the service delivery platform server .

The subscriber information database server may include information associated with each subscriber such as account information how many devices are associated with the account a physical address of the account contact information associated with the subscriber e.g. email address and phone number other subscriber related information or any combination thereof.

The IPTV bootstrap server and the custom bootstrap server may authenticate one or more set top box devices such as the set top box device and send the set top box devices a decryption key associated with the digital rights management scheme used by the service delivery platform server to enable the set top box devices to decrypt the media content for display at a display device. The IPTV bootstrap server may be a generic bootstrap server provided by an IPTV equipment provider. The custom bootstrap server may be specific to a particular service provider.

The video hub office may distribute the media content sent from the service delivery platform to routers such as the router for routing to one or more set top box devices. The router may route the media content sent from the service delivery platform to one or more central office switches such as the central office switch for delivery to one or more set top box devices. The access node may connect the customer premises to the core network i.e. the video hub office the router and the central office switch to provide telephony services internet services and media content services to subscribers.

The custom bootstrap server may authenticate the set top box device by sending an authentication request to the subscriber information database server . After receiving the authentication request the subscriber information database server may authenticate the set top box device and send a response code to the custom bootstrap server . Based on the response code the custom bootstrap server may send a retrieve service profile request to the service delivery platform server . In response to receiving the retrieve service profile request the service delivery platform server may send a service profile associated with the set top box device to the custom bootstrap server . In response to receiving the service profile from the service delivery platform server the custom bootstrap server may send an authentication result message to the IPTV bootstrap server . In response to receiving the authentication result message the IPTV bootstrap server may send a provide deny message to the set top box device . When the set top box device has been authenticated the provide deny message may include a decryption key to enable the set top box device to decrypt the media content that is received from the service delivery platform server . When the set top box device has not been authenticated the provide deny message may indicate that the set top box device is not authorized to display the media content .

Thus when the set top box device encounters an error e.g. a system crash or memory corruption that results in the loss of the decryption key the set top box device may be authenticated using the service delivery platform server the subscriber information database server the custom bootstrap server and the IPTV bootstrap server . When the set top box device is authenticated the decryption key may be automatically retrieved from the service delivery platform server and sent to the set top box device . The decryption key may be retrieved and sent to the set top box device without a subscriber associated with the set top box device calling a customer service representative to retrieve the decryption key thereby increasing customer satisfaction.
