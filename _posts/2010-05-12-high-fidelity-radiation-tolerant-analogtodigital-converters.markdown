title: High fidelity, radiation tolerant analog-to-digital converters
abstract: Techniques for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using pipeline architecture includes a linearization technique for a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) over 80 deciBels. In some embodiments, sampling rates exceed a megahertz. According to a second approach, a switched-capacitor circuit is configured for correct operation in a high radiation environment. In one embodiment, the combination yields high fidelity ADC (>88 deciBel SFDR) while sampling at 5 megahertz sampling rates and consuming <60 milliWatts. Furthermore, even though it is manufactured in a commercial 0.25-μm CMOS technology (1 μm=12meters), it maintains this performance in harsh radiation environments. Specifically, the stated performance is sustained through a highest tested 2 megarad(Si) total dose, and the ADC displays no latchup up to a highest tested linear energy transfer of 63 million electron Volts square centimeters per milligram at elevated temperature (131 degrees C.) and supply (2.7 Volts, versus 2.5 Volts nominal).

Plasma waves guide the space weather of the upper atmosphere including the radiation belts. With the increasing number of assets orbiting the Earth in these regions interest in plasma wave dynamics has grown. For example applications such as radiation belt remediation wherein damaging enhanced radiation levels are reduced by controlled precipitation of energetic particle populations have spurred recent research. Satellite missions to measure these phenomena in situ are an integral part of these efforts.

Plasma wave signals span a broad range of powers over 120 deciBels dB where a deciBel expresses a range as ten times the difference between the logarithms of the largest and smallest values over a broad bandwidth from 0.1 Hz to 1 megahertz MHz where Hertz Hz is a cycle per second and 1 MHz 10Hz . Furthermore they evolve dynamically in time often on millisecond ms time scales where 1 ms 10seconds . To capture as much of this signal in situ as possible instruments are needed that cover broad ranges of sampling rates durations and dynamic range under conditions of high radiation.

Therefore there is a need for a radiation hardened analog to digital converter ADC that captures an input bandwidth of 100 Hz to 1 MHz by sampling at 5 megasamples per second MS s 1 MS 10samples and maintaining a spurious free dynamic range SFDR of at least 90 dB assuming a Fast Fourier Transform FFT bin width of 100 Hz .

According to a first set of embodiments an analog to digital converter ADC using a pipeline architecture includes a linearization technique for a spurious free dynamic range SFDR over 80 dB. In some embodiments of the first set sampling rates exceed a megahertz. In some embodiments of the first set a stage of the pipeline architecture includes a sufficient number of extra sub ADC transition levels so that discontinuity heights between adjacent segments in a transfer function is strictly less than an input range of a backend ADC comprising all following stages. In some embodiments of the first set a stage of the pipeline architecture includes a calibration module configured to produce both a digital to analog converter DAC code difference and an autozero difference between successive phases in a sampling interval. In some of these embodiments the stage of the pipeline architecture includes a digital logic module configured to populate a calibration lookup table based on the DAC code difference and the autozero difference.

According to a second set of embodiments a switched capacitor circuit is configured for correct operation in a high radiation environment. According to some embodiments of the second set the switched capacitor circuit includes enclosed terminal layout for n type metal oxide semiconductor NMOS components in switches. According to some embodiments of the second set the switched capacitor circuit is configured with self resetting circuitry. In some embodiments of the second set offset cancellation is incorporated in the self resetting configuration. In some embodiments of the second set guard rings are positioned near active components. In some embodiments of the second set the circuit includes a stack of p type metal oxide semiconductor PMOS diodes in series with an off chip resister to drive a master bias current. In some embodiments of the second set the circuit includes operational amplifiers with a bandwidth or gain or both that exceeds operating specifications of the circuit to allow for bandwidth degradation during exposure to high radiation.

According to various other embodiments methods are performed to build or operate one or more of the apparatus embodiments described above. In some other embodiments logic embedded in tangible media is configured to populate a calibration lookup table based on a DAC code difference and an autozero difference.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

A method and apparatus are disclosed for a radiation tolerant high fidelity analog to digital converter ADC . In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Although several embodiments of the invention are discussed with respect to a small footprint low power radiation tolerant high fidelity megahertz sampling ADC fabricated using low cost easily accessible commercial CMOS manufacturing processes embodiments of the invention are not limited to this context. For example it is explicitly anticipated that in some embodiments the self calibration technique of this disclosure is extended to a variety of residue amplifier architectures. Furthermore it is also explicitly anticipated that the radiation hardness by design techniques of this disclosure are applied alone or in some combination to general switched capacitor circuits which are used in a variety of applications e.g. from filters to ADCs . Furthermore both techniques are applicable to circuits designed in other manufacturing processes.

Furthermore although several embodiments are described with respect to application on satellites for the measurement of plasma waves applications are not limited to this context. For example in other embodiments the techniques described herein are used for other satellite systems wherever signal digitization is needed from sensors on scientific instrumentation to digitization on communication links to monitoring for bus housekeeping in nuclear power plants e.g. for monitoring systems in particle accelerators in nuclear medicine in systems that must function at high altitudes and in digital radio and other wideband high fidelity communication systems such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM systems where the low power afforded makes it especially attractive in mobile applications.

Digital systems include a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information between other internal and external components of the system. Information also called data is represented as a physical expression of a measurable phenomenon typically electric voltages but including in other embodiments such phenomena as magnetic electromagnetic pressure chemical biological molecular atomic sub atomic and quantum interactions. For example north and south magnetic fields or a zero and non zero electric voltage represent two states 0 1 of a binary digit bit . Other phenomena can represent digits of a higher base. In some embodiments information called analog data is represented by a near continuum of measurable values within a particular range. A bus includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus. One or more processors for processing information and memory for storing information are coupled with the bus.

The memory such as a random access memory RAM or other dynamic storage device stores information including processor instructions. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system. RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. A read only memory ROM or other static storage device is coupled to the bus for storing static information including instructions that is not changed by the digital system. Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Some memory is composed of non volatile persistent storage device such as a magnetic disk optical disk or flash card for storing information including instructions that persists even when the digital system is turned off or otherwise loses power.

Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer readable storage media and special purpose hardware.

Improvements in various embodiments are grouped into two categories described in more detail below self calibration technique for achieving the high linearity implied by the desired SFDR and the application of radiation hardness by design techniques for achieving the radiation tolerance.

The ADC uses a pipeline architecture. Circuit limitations and manufacturing variations though typically limit these architectures to 8 bit to 10 bit resolution. This in turn limits linearity SFDR is typically just 70 to 80 dB. The novel self calibration technique then presents an economical way to overcome these limitations while incurring minimal increase in power consumption circuit area and circuit complexity. Specifically the self calibration technique configures and measures the discontinuity heights between adjacent segments of the stage transfer function in novel ways.

A pipeline converter accomplishes quantization through a series of pipeline stages. is a diagram illustrating a stage of a pipelined analog to digital converter ADC according to one embodiment. It encompasses an analog stage and accompanying digital reconstruction . The analog stage quantizes its analog input Vin through a coarse sub ADC generating the digital output B. Through a subsequent residue amplifier comprising a sub DAC subtraction element and gain element amplifier the analog stage then generates a gained version of the quantization error of that coarse quantization dubbed the analog output residue Vout which is passed on to any subsequent stages here represented as a backend ADC for further quantization. The DAC outputs a nominal voltage for each digital ouput B value. To construct a digital estimate of Vin then the operation of the analog stage is simply reversed in the digital reconstruction a lookup table supplies a sub DAC voltage digitally gained by G corresponding to digital output B and the backend ADC provides V out the quantized version of Vout which are combined in adder element as shown to produce G V in a quantized version of the analog input Vin . Notably it is inconsequential here that V in is gained by digital gain G because this linear gain can be easily adjusted and does not harm conversion accuracy.

Techniques that use DAC differences residue amplifier for instance to calibrate residue amplifiers that are biphasic are not new. However direct applications of the principle to standard pipeline stages result in DAC difference outputs from residue amplifier that easily exceed a linear range of the next stage e.g. backend ADC . The accompanying increase in estimation error renders the technique useless from a practical perspective for multiple stage ADCs.

To overcome this deficiency one previous technique opted to decrease the stage gain G supplied by amplifier diminishing all discontinuity heights in the analog signal e.g. output from sub DAC . While useful for the two step converter it was applied to this technique is not practical for pipeline converters since when applied to multiple stages it severely decreases converter resolution. The combined gain of all the stages combined with the resolution of the final sub ADC determines the overall resolution of the entire pipeline converter. Hence the desired resolution sets the product of the gains of all the stages. For any one stage the gain G is typically selected by a broad ranging optimization that takes into account power speed accuracy noise and the capabilities of the manufacturing process. Typically the result is a stage gain of 2 for some integer n and a transfer function wherein the discontinuities are of height VREF. Such stages are considered efficient in that they provide sub ADC error tolerance while retaining simple digital reconstruction implementations. Changing the gain G changes the overall pipeline resolution.

Alternate solutions include capacitor splitting and capacitor based offsetting. In the former sample capacitors are divided into smaller capacitances and the final DAC difference estimate constructed from the sums of such differences over the smaller capacitors. In the latter an offset sample capacitor decreases the residue amplifier output during the DAC difference estimate. The offset is then lumped into the autozero measurement. However in both these techniques the actual DAC codes of sub DAC are no longer applied during calibration and thus these techniques are vulnerable to differences in loading and clocking effects between nominal and calibration operation.

In a new approach applied in some embodiments configuration of a stage is designed with a modified transfer function that has a sufficient number of extra sub ADC transition levels and corresponding sub DAC codes that the discontinuity height between adjacent segments in the transfer function is strictly less than the input range of the backend ADC . For example a traditional 2.8 bit stage transfer function can be modified by adding 2 extra segments. As a result the discontinuity heights of the new stage are reduced from VREF to just 0.75 VREF where VREF is a reference voltage. and are diagrams and respectively that illustrate voltage outputs by segments of a transfer function for one stage of a pipelined ADC according to two embodiments. The horizontal axis is Vin and the vertical axis is Vout. Both a trace of the analog output Vout and bins of digital output B are shown. The analog voltage discontinuity from the end of one digital bin to the beginning of the next is shown. shows the transfer function of the original 2.8 bit stage including a residue amplifier gain of 4 6 sub ADC transition levels at Vin values of VREF and 7 sub DAC output levels nominal voltages at Vin values of 2 4 0 2 4 VREF resulting in discontinuities each dropping from VREF 2 to VREF 2 for a discontinuity height of VREF. shows the transfer function of modified sub ADC of the resulting 3.1 bit stage including the same residue amplifier gain but 8 sub ADC transition levels at Vin values of 21 32 15 32 9 32 3 32 3 32. 9 32 15 32 21 32 VREF and 9 sub DAC output levels nominal voltages at Vin values of 24 32 18 32 12 32 6 32 0 32 6 32 12 32 18 32 24 32 VREF resulting in discontinuities each dropping from VREF to VREF for a discontinuity height of VREF 0.75 VREF . Function is generated from a device that has transfer function by adding two extra segments by adding two extra transition levels in stage sub ADC and two extra output levels nominal voltages in stage sub DAC

Adding stage segments to decrease the nominal sub DAC difference output is not previously known. This allows the stage to maintain its gain G and also allows the actual DAC codes in sub DAC to be used during calibration. Any number of segments can be added in other embodiments. In the illustrated embodiment of 2 segments are added to reduce the discontinuity height to three quarters nominal. Adding segments to reduce discontinuity height offers the advantage of maintaining the stage gain and thus maintaining the overall ADC resolution without requiring additional stages and still enabling calibration to improve the fidelity of the ADC.

Segments are added by adding transition levels to and adjusting the existing levels of the sub ADC e.g. by adding comparators and by adding output levels to and adjusting the existing output levels of the sub DAC so that they are at the zero crossings of the new transfer function such as that shown in . At the circuit level it depends on the particular circuits used to implement the sub ADC and sub DAC. For example for the residue amplifier of described below which implements the sub DAC adding another segment would involve increasing R by 1 and then adjusting the ratios of the Cr and Cr capacitors r 1 . . . R with the CF and CF capacitors. For the vast majority of sub ADC and sub DAC embodiments the needed addition and adjustment is readily discerned by one of ordinary skill.

In a second complementary approach used in some embodiments the reconfigured stage is augmented with additional components to generate detect and use additional calibration signals. The additional components include a calibration signal module interfacing with the residue amplifier by means of additional circuitry described below and a calibration logic module to control the calibration signal module and correct the lookup table of the standard digital reconstruction based on the new calibration signals using a method described in more detail below.

It is well known that the quantization accuracy of a pipeline converter is limited by the matching between corresponding parameters in the analog stage and digital reconstruction and in particular by mismatches between the sub DAC and gain blocks of the analog stage and the lookup table of the digital reconstruction circuit . These can arise due to circuit limitations and manufacturing variations. This typically limits pipeline converters to 8 bit to 10 bit resolution which in turns limits linearity SFDR is typically just 70 dB to 80 dB.

In the illustrated embodiment a self calibration technique is employed that provides an economical way to overcome the known limitations while incurring minimal increase in power consumption circuit area and circuit complexity. Specifically the technique measures the discontinuity heights between adjacent segments of the stage transfer function. These discontinuity heights encompass the entire meaningful mismatch between a the sub DAC and gain blocks of the analog stage and b the lookup table of the digital reconstruction circuit . These measurements are used to update the digital reconstruction lookup table . By introducing the novel stage transfer function modification of adding extra segments as previously detailed the self calibration technique can now directly measure the discontinuity heights by direct differencing of DAC codes instead of relying on the use of additional input voltages or indirect measurements requiring additional digital processing as in capacitor splitting and capacitor based offsetting .

The actual calibration of the stage revolves around the stage residue amplifier which is typically a biphasic amplifier that implements the sub DAC subtraction and gain blocks of the analog stage . A modified amplifier is shown in and . is a diagram illustrating a modified analog residue amplifier used as residue amplifier of according to one embodiment and is a timing diagram illustrating timing of phases of operation of the analog reside amplifier of . An example of a fully differential circuit implementation is shown in with modifications for enhanced calibration using a reference signal VREF. Modified analog residue amplifier includes operational amplifier switches and and capacitors and as well as leads carrying one or more voltage differences. Vin Vin Vin Vout Vout Vout and VREF VREF VREF . Conceptually VREF is used to set the decision levels of the sub ADC and the output levels of the sub DAC all these levels are designed to be fractions of VREF. The ratios of the various capacitors are determined by the desired sub DAC output levels. The specific value of a capacitor once one is chosen all the rest are determined by said ratios is chosen based upon a broad system level optimization. What is shown in is one particular embodiment of a residue amplifier including sub DAC subtractor and gain block . Different embodiments are possible.

In the horizontal axis is time and four vertically offset vertical axes and indicate the size of control signals such as voltages that close switches . The signal that closes switches near the amplifier is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that closes switches is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that closes switches is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that operates sub ADC in is called comp and is plotted on vertical axis as trace for timing reference.

During normal operation the residue amplifier processes Vin during the sample phase time during which signal and signal are positive . During the amplify phase time during which signal is positive a certain set of the capacitors Cr r 1 . . . R are switched to VREF the remainder are switched VREF the corresponding Cr are switched to VREF and VREF respectively as shown in . The particular set of Cr switched to VREF is determined by the sub ADC decision. In this way Hence given a particular sub ADC result the residue amplifier produces a particular sub DAC output voltage by switching a particular set of Cr capacitors to VREF . The particular set of Cr capacitors thus switched is said to implement a particular DAC code where the DAC code is the sub DAC input. In addition the amplifier is configured to provide an overall gain during the amplify phase.

Under calibration by the calibration logic module the stage residue amplifier is reconfigured to reroute signals internal to the stage . In particular two types of calibration configurations are used a DAC difference configuration and an autozero configuration. In a configuration called DAC difference the calibration signal module causes the residue amplifier to implement DAC code m 1 corresponding to the m 1 segment during the sample phase and a DAC code m corresponding to the m segment during the amplify phase . The residue amplifier output during the amplify phase is thus the height of the discontinuity between these two transfer function segments. In a configuration called autozero the calibration signal module causes the residue amplifier to implement the same DAC code say DAC code 0 during both phases. In each calibration configuration the modified residue amplifier with calibration signal module is kept in the configuration for several cycles. Its output is then measured by the backend ADC and averaged to arrive at the calibration logic module where the DAC difference and autozero estimates are derived.

Conceptually during calibration calibration signal module interrupts the signals to the subtractor band reroutes various output levels of the sub DAC to be input to the subtractor as per the desired DAC difference or autozero configuration. In residue amplifier implementing these configurations simply involves retiming the switches and during calibration switches are never closed connected and switches are closed connected so that they correspond to one DAC code during the sample phase and another under the DAC difference configuration or the same under the autozero configuration DAC code during the amplify phase. The control of the switches is handled by calibration signal module as directed by the calibration controller embedded in calibration logic module .

The stage digital reconstruction circuit is implemented with a lookup table . The procedure is implemented in calibration logic module configured to execute five steps. In step the first entry of the stage lookup table is set to an initial offset typically 0 . In step while the autozero configuration is adopted the autozero output from the backend ADC is derived typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles and stored in a cache within the calibration logic module . In step while the DAC difference configuration using the first two DAC codes i.e. DAC code 1 during the sample phase 0 during the amplify phase is adopted a DAC difference output is received from the backend ADC and an estimate is derived in the calibration logic module typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles and the stored autozero estimate in cache is subtracted from this DAC difference estimate. The first entry of the stage lookup table is added to this estimate and the sum result is stored as the second entry of the stage lookup table . In step while the DAC difference configuration for the next two DAC codes are adopted the appropriate DAC difference output is received from the backend ADC and an estimate is derived in the calibration logic module typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles and the stored autozero estimate is subtracted from this DAC difference estimate. The result of the previous i.e. last entered lookup table entry is added to this estimate and the sum is stored as the next entry of the stage lookup table . In step step is repeated until estimates are made for all adjacent pairs of DAC codes. The new values in the lookup table are used to calibrate the digital signals B received during the next round of sampling.

Calibration is performed at startup. So long as the stage analog circuit blocks remain the same calibration need not be performed again. If analog circuit blocks component values change though and in particular if the analog component values associated with the stage residue amplifier change then calibration can be repeated. For example such changes may occur with large temperature changes or due to accumulated radiation dose effect. In various embodiments any schedule or condition may be used to initiate the calibration process. For example in some embodiments the calibration process is initiated every few hours or upon detection of a certain radiation dose or temperature change. In the satellite applications the ADC is often kept off when not in use to conserve power and recalibration is performed every time the ADC is turned on.

The overhead incurred by the technique is simply some additional digital logic in the stage switches to implement the calibration configurations on the analog side in particular it requires no additional analog hardware as it simply repurposes already existent switches . The calibration logic module includes another control module that directs and coordinates the calibration signal module and the calibration logic module . When calibration is invoked the control module dictates which lookup table entry is being worked on and adjusts the calibration signal module appropriately. As this controller is a digital system in practice it is incorporated into the calibration logic module .

Modification to the digital reconstruction block involves only some control logic to direct calibration and signal processing for producing the autozero estimate and DAC difference estimates from the output of the backend ADC . The signal processing can be very simple if averaging is used the technique adds a simple averager typically over 2samples N a positive integer to simplify implementation and some adders and registers. As such the technique allows pipeline converters to overcome circuit limitations and manufacturing variations without resorting to power hungry methods such as increasing device and capacitor sizing.

Using the lookup table entries measured and filled in this way offers the advantage of more accurate calibration than using a fixed lookup table.

Radiation hardness by design encompasses a combination of design choices in implementing the analog circuits of the pipeline including one or more of A. Enclosed terminal layout B. Self resetting circuitry C. Latchup prevention D. Stable generation of master bias current and E. Analog overdesign.

The enclosed terminal layout has been previously noted for its proficiency in eliminating radiation induced leakage current. As such leakage would compromise performance of switched capacitor circuitry enclosed terminal layout is used for the n channel metal oxide semiconductor NMOS components in the switches of such circuits including the residue amplifier with switches and comparators.

Circuit diagram symbols respectively for both devices are shown at bottom. The enclosed terminal is indicated by a box affixed to the appropriate terminal of the NMOS device. In symbol the box is affixed to source terminal S. These enclosed terminal components are then combined with a p channel metal oxide semiconductor PMOS components to form complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS switches as shown in .

This is believed to be the first use of the enclosed terminal layout in a switched capacitor circuit design like the residue amplifier . Traditionally annular component layouts have been used. The enclosed terminal layout though has advantages in that it displays less asymmetry than the annular layout. Furthermore as it cleaves closer to the standard component layout a model for the enclosed terminal component is easier to derive from the standard component model provided by a manufacturer. This promotes practical use of the device in analog circuits.

To prevent charge accumulation on nodes due to radiation strikes every node of the circuit is designed to be driven by a strong low impedance source at least once a cycle. A circuit node is any point where two or more circuit elements meet. This is efficiently done by the use of self resetting switched capacitor circuitry wherein the strong currents of the amplifiers themselves are used for this purpose. In particular the input nodes of the amplifier are driven by a strong low impedance source at least once a cycle by shorting the input and output terminals of the amplifier by closing switches . In addition offset cancellation is incorporated into the self resetting configurations to cancel 1 f noise. Radiation induced increases in 1 f noise would otherwise compromise ADC low frequency performance at high doses.

Latchup refers to inadvertent creation of a low impedance path between the power supply rails of a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET circuit triggering a parasitic structure which disrupts proper functioning of the part and possibly even leading to its destruction due to overcurrent. High radiation can cause latchup.

To prevent latchup extensive guard rings are placed near active components. is a diagram illustrating use of guard rings on a CMOS component according to an embodiment. In guard rings identified as N diffusions around the PMOS component MP and P diffusions around the NMOS component MN are illustrated for an inverter a basic circuit building block. The inverter includes a Vin contact and a Vout contact . Wherever possible the guard ring diffusions are metalized such as metalized guard ring diffusions to further reduce their parasitic electrical resistance. However in some embodiments the metallization is omitted to allow wiring while maintaining the ring. This configuration is seen in the unmetallized diffusions between the NMOS and PMOS devices. As proposed the use of guard rings is a general layout technique used throughout the design and can be applied to any circuit or component.

Many devices experience power consumption increases with radiation. To counter this the master analog current of the ADC is produced as depicted in . is a diagram illustrating a source of a master bias current according to an embodiment. In an off chip resistor is depicted which proved more convenient in lab testing. The master current is derived from a stack of PMOS diodes e.g. PMOS diodes . . . in series with a current source e.g. sources . . . . As the threshold voltage of PMOS devices only increases in absolute value with radiation versus an NMOS device whose threshold voltage may increase or decrease the master current will only decrease with radiation as the PMOS diodes require ever higher threshold voltages to pass the current. This helps limit analog power consumption with increasing radiation dose.

Analog circuits are overdesigned in select regards for example the bandwidth and gain of the operational amplifiers are extended to compensate for radiation induced transconductance degradation. As such overdesign does tend to increase power consumption it is used selectively throughout the design.

The prototype ADC includes seven pipelined stages through numbered 0 through 6 respectively. The corresponding blocks in are depicted as a monolithic calibration engine and digital reconstruction circuit block . Stage records portions of the analog input tracks those portions and feeds those portions forward into the next stage . Stages and are calibrated stages and stages and are uncalibrated stages .

The calibrated stages are modified according to with extra segments to provide 3.1 bit resolution 9 segments numbered 0 through 8 and abbreviated segs in as depicted in . Calibration signals through are generated by block in corresponding calibration logic modules and sent to corresponding calibration signal modules in the stages through . The digital output B is shown as B signals and from the corresponding analog stages to the corresponding digital reconstruction blocks in block . In the depicted embodiment three calibrated stages are included. The number of calibrated stages depends on the desired amount of correction. If finer correction is needed more stages can be calibrated if coarser correction is needed fewer stages can be calibrated. The amount of correction depends on the desired SFDR and the inherent SFDR achieved by the pipeline in an uncalibrated state. Any method may be used to determine the number of calibrated stages. In an example embodiment the number of calibrated stages was determined using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

Well known 2.8 bit analog stages composed of 7 segments numbered 0 through 6 as depicted in are used for stages and in the uncalibrated stages . A well known 4 bit flash ADC with 16 segments is used in stage stage does not include a residue amplifier. The binary outputs of the uncalibrated stages are shown as B signals and . The combined digital output from all stages is provided by block and depicted as digital output .
