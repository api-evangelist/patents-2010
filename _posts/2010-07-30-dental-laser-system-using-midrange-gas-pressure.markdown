This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to co pending commonly owned U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 229 997 entitled DENTAL LASER SYSTEM USING MIDRANGE GAS PRESSURE filed Jul. 30 2009 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for removing decay cutting drilling or shaping hard tissue removing and cutting soft tissue modifying hard tissue for caries inhibition and modifying hard tissue surface conditions to aid in adhesion to hard tissue. The present invention applies to oral tissue gums and teeth e.g. to human or animal oral tissue gums and teeth.

A tooth has three layers. The outermost layer is the enamel which is the hardest and forms a protective layer for the rest of the tooth. The middle and bulk of the tooth is made up of the dentin and the innermost layer is the pulp. The enamel and dentin are similar in composition and are roughly 85 mineral carbonated hydroxyapatite while the pulp contains vessels and nerves which are sensitive to pressure and temperature. In this application of drilling or contouring or conditioning the enamel and dentin the pulp s temperature sensitivity is of concern. A rise in temperature of 5.5 Celsius can lead to permanent damage of the tooth s pulp.

Over the last 10 to 15 years research has taken place to define laser parameters that allow the enamel and dentin of a tooth to be removed drilled contoured or conditioned all being removal processes without heating the pulp. Ideally the laser pulses should vaporize the enamel and dentin converting the mass to gas with minimal residual energy remaining in the dentin to heat the pulp.

The use of lasers in dentistry has been considered since the introduction of the laser. Dental lasers used to drill and cut were the initial applications. High energy density pulses were initially used but these pulses could potentially damage the tooth pulp or soft tissue so lower energy pulse configurations were explored. With lower peak power energy pulses longer pulse times were used which affected the tooth enamel detrimentally.

Various laser wavelength interactions were explored UV to the Far Infrared to understand the optical coupling efficiencies. Optical coupling was found to be critical with the greatest coupling being in the 2.7 3.0 meter and 9.3 9.6 m wavelength ranges. When reflectance is considered the 9.3 9.6 meter range was found to couple up to 3 times better than any other wavelength range.

Having identified the most effective coupling wavelength the time and threshold to ablate hard tissue had to be determined. Research has shown that the thermal relaxation time of hard tissue is 1 to 2 sec with a threshold ablation energy of approximately 5 mJ milli Joules .

Recognizing the need for laser pulses in the 9.3 to 9.6 meter wavelength range with microsecond pulse widths and pulse energies of 5 to 15 mJ DC excited TEA transversely excited atmospheric lasers were adopted. Since the TEA lasers have a very short pulse length i.e. hundreds of nanoseconds the TEA lasers were modified for long pulse operation and modified pulse shapes. Additionally a RF Radio Frequency CW continuous wave laser was studied but its shortest pulse length was only 50 seconds so the pulses heated the hard tissue significantly more than the shorter pulse widths.

To date RF excited COCW lasers seeking the greatest RF to Optical efficiency typically operate at 70 to 100 Torr or about 9 332 13 332 Pascals Pa and the shortest pulse lengths produced are typically 50 seconds. Typical gas pressure for a normal RF excited COlaser used in the prior art is 80 Torr or about 10 665 Pa . COTEA lasers operating at atmospheric pressure produce 9.3 to 9.6 meter pulses at hundreds of nanoseconds in pulse length. TEA lasers generally do not operate in sealed operation do not have long operating lifetimes or high pulse repetition rates and are expensive to package. While a long pulse TEA laser can be manufactured to produce the optimal COlaser pulsing parameters TEA lasers are larger and more expensive than RF excited lasers and therefore are not an ideal match for a dental laser application where size and cost are critical. None of the approaches to date therefore have produced a full set of optimal parameters in a commercially acceptable format for effectively working with enamel and dentin without heating the pulp.

With respect to dental laser systems the wavelength with the highest absorption in hydroxyapatite has been determined to be in the 9.3 to 9.6 meter range and the thermal relaxation time of hydroxyapatite to be a maximum of 2 seconds at 9.3 to 9.6 m wavelength range. Therefore the ideal pulse parameters for removing the hydroxyapatite appear to be 9.3 to 9.6 meter energy in a less than 50 second format. In accordance with the preferred embodiment a laser is provided that produces a beam having pulse parameters for removing hydroxyapatite using 9.3 to 9.6 m wavelength energy in a less than 50 second format.

The 9.3 to 9.6 m energy is typically produced using a COlaser with a laser gas mixture of C O wavelength selective resonator optics more expensive inter cavity wavelength devices or a combination of the three. In accordance with the present invention the 50 second pulses are produced with a fast pulse rise and fall time which is effected by laser gas pressure. In order to produce pulses of less than or equal to 50 seconds in length with gas pressure of at least about 260 Torr or about 34 663 Pa .

According to preferred embodiment a COgas laser in either a waveguide or slab resonator format filled with gas that is in a range of about 260 Torr to 600 Torr or about 34 700 80 000 Pa which is RF excited for use in all dental applications. A range of about 260 to 600 Torr or about 34 700 80 000 Pa may be preferable in many dental applications. Since waveguide and slab resonators are generally known in the art they are not discussed in detail herein.

In some embodiments the pressure can be in a range of about 280 550 Torr or about 37 330 73 327 Pa about 300 500 Torr or about 39 996 66 661 Pa about 320 450 Torr or about 42 663 59 995 Pa about 340 400 Torr or about 45 329 53 328 Pa as examples.

The laser can be operated in CW or pulsed mode for cutting and drilling applications respectively. DC and RF power supplies are configured to aid in low power CW operation while supporting high peak power pulse operation. The laser output is coupled to a beam delivery system to deliver the optical energy to the patient. The laser provides the 9.3 to 9.6 m energy wavelength with a fast pulse rise and fall time e.g. not more than about 50 seconds and preferably not more than 20 second sealed off operation high repetition rates in a small reliable package.

Item is a radio frequency RF power supply for the conversion of the DC energy to RF energy in the 40 to 125 MHZ range. Item is a COlaser with the RF energy as an input and 9.3 to 9.6 meter optical energy as an output via an output coupler . And item is a beam delivery apparatus which delivers the optical energy from the laser to item which represents a patient s mouth.

COlaser in this embodiment includes a rear mirror and a laser discharge area . The mirror directs optical energy through the laser discharge area . The output coupler couples the beam out of the laser. In this case the laser is a gas laser so the output coupler couples the beam out of the laser without allowing the laser gas out. The COlaser also includes a laser gas pressure vessel that is filled with a gas at a pressure in a range of about 260 to about 600 Torr or about 34 700 80 000 Pa .

The output laser energy is provided to the beam delivery apparatus where it can then be directed to a target such as a patient s mouth. In this embodiment the beam delivery apparatus can include a combination of flat or curved mirrors configured to steer optical energy output from the COlaser.

In this exemplary configuration the dental laser system can operate at both low power CW operation e.g. 5 mJ pulse energy at 1 to 50 seconds pulse widths up to 10 KHz. The COlaser can operate at wavelengths between 9 and 11 m. The laser system preferably provides high peak power pulsing operation at the ideal absorption wavelength for the hydroxyapatite in dental hard tissues. The pulse widths and pulse energy are ideally suited to ablate hydroxyapatite leaving very little residual heat in the tooth to damage the pulp even up to 10 KHz in operation.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. For example it is possible that the described laser and laser system could be used in other non dental applications. It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
