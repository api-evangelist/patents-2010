The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to fasteners for strut channels. In particular the invention relates to self contained fasteners for attaching and detaching components to strut channels without tools.

Universal mounting rails are utilized in a variety of applications. Generically referred to as strut channels these can be available in multiple shapes and sizes. They are traditionally found within buildings and industrial complexes often behind the scenes in service and maintenance corridors.

An emerging use for the channel is for load equipment fastening for ground vehicles both in the civilian and military sector. They provide a strong simple and cost effective mounting methodology that allows for flexibility when attaching components sensors peripherals and any other equipment that needs to be attached either in the interior or on the exterior of a vehicle.

Several techniques currently exist for attaching components to these universal mounting rails. Many of the conventional devices are tailored to a specific function or require the use of hand tools to install or remove. In many cases a strut channel nut is placed in the channel with the component to be attached aligned with a coaxial hole to the nut and then a fastening bolt inserted through the hole and tightened at the nut.

While simple and effective such conventional devices typically require multiple separate pieces to be set up in a specific order before tightening and can be cumbersome as well as time consuming. More importantly in almost all cases tools are required to tighten down the fasteners. Consequently the conventional methods are difficult to use in an outdoor or military environment where tools and supplies are limited and installation time is an important operational consideration.

Conventional channel fasteners yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a self contained fastener for attaching to a structure having opposing edges that flank a cavity across a gap.

For these embodiments the fastener includes a grip member a clamp member and a latch member. In various exemplary embodiments the grip member has a knob and an inner annulus disposed thereon along an axis of symmetry. The knob has a central through hole coaxial with the inner annulus. The inner annulus has an arc tab that radially protrudes therefrom.

In further embodiments the clamp member includes a boss and an outer annulus disposed thereon. The boss has first and second dimensions perpendicular to the axis the first dimension being shorter than the gap. The clamp member is flanked by opposing ledges along the second dimension. Each ledge is arranged to engage a respective edge of the structure. The inner annulus is coaxially insertable into the outer annulus.

In further embodiments the latch member includes a stud and a flange. The stud is insertable at a proximal end into the inner annulus and the through hole. The flange is disposed at a distal end of the stud and has a third dimension shorter than the gap. The flange and the block can be inserted into the cavity along the respective third and first dimensions through the gap. In response to clockwise turning the knob rotates the tab within the angular notch until inhibited by the outer annulus whereby the proximal end of the stud retracts into the through hole thereby engaging the fastener to the structure.

In alternate embodiments the fastener further includes a cap member that engages the knob. The cap member includes a locking mechanism for securing the clamp member. In additional embodiments the through hole includes a flat wall parallel to the axis the stud has a truncation surface at the proximal end and the truncation surface engages the wall in response to retraction of the stud into the through hole.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a self contained strut channel component fastener that enables components to be mounted to a universal style mounting rail such as a strut channel. In particular the fastener described herein can be installed and detached using only one hand and without tools such as for alignment or application of torque.

For military vehicles techniques are needed to attach equipment and or components to the exterior of a vehicle rapidly. This should be accomplished without tools beyond a human hand. Moreover such attachment should preferably resist accidental loosening due to abrasion by the environment and vibration.

The strut includes a channel floor flanked by a right wall and a left wall . The upper portions of the walls respectively terminate with curve cross section inverted J lips that project inward. The right wall terminates in a right lip and the left wall terminates in a left lip . Components to be mounted to the strut can clamp to the lips .

The strut channel component fastener can be utilized in different manners. For example the fastener can be used to attach a variety of components or equipment mounted to plates to universal mounting rails. The fastener can be used singularly to attach at one point to a single rail multiple points to attach to a single rail or multiple points to span between two rails. Different methods of mounting to rails using strut channel component fasteners.

The entire strut fastener can be contained in a single unit for installing to the components and to be mounted. This integral construction prevents the fastener or portions thereof from being lost or dropped. The design also simplifies alignment with the strut reducing the time required to install the components and . Additionally the construction and operation of the fastener is also such to enable installation in the middle of the strut negating the need to slide the fastener along the rail in the longitudinal direction to its desired position.

The surface also includes a central orifice aligned along the symmetry axis . The boundary includes grooves parallel to the axis that facilitate manipulation by hand. A spring plunger ball detent inserts into the cap through the peripheral orifice . A stop insert inhibits rotation of the knob assembly beyond a specific limit.

A lower knob assembly includes the grip having an upper surface along which is a plurality of peripheral cavities which all have equidistant radii from the axis as the cap s peripheral orifice . An annular shaft descends from the grip along the axis . The upper surface also includes a central orifice along the axis and a linear slot orifice adjacent to the central orifice .

The stop insert can be disposed into the slot orifice to provide a flat surface within the central orifice . The grip has an outer cylindrical rim with ridges or wings that radially protrude therefrom to facilitate manipulation by hand. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that alternate finger grasping surfaces besides grooves and wings can be employed without departing from the scope of the invention.

A base assembly includes the clamp and the key annulus . The clamp includes a platform with an upper surface having a pair of peripheral orifices that are radially equidistant from the axis as the counterpart orifice and cavities . The clamp also includes lower ledges that flank a boss that extends underneath the platform with a linear notch in the center. The detent inserted in the orifice can halt at any of the cavities . The boss has length and width that may differ the width being sufficiently short to insert between the channel lips and . The length is preferably sufficiently long to enable adequate contact by the ledges to the lips and .

The key annulus opens to an axial cavity with its distal end opposite the linear notch having a longitudinally incision that extends angularly by substantially 180 or radians to form an angular notch . A latch assembly includes the stud with its coaxial spring and terminating flange at the stud s distal end to axially restrain the spring .

At the stud s proximate end opposite the flange the stud exhibits a flat or spiral surface obscured by the cylindrical portion that incises across a portion of radial circumference. An insert separately shows the surface on a proximal portion of the stud . The base assembly attaches to the strut at the lips and as described subsequently. The annular shaft inserts into the cavity enabling the lower knob assembly to rotate 90 or radians to engage and disengage with the strut .

The third installation view shows the flange turned substantially perpendicular to the rail direction as shown in elevation view . The fourth installation view shows the stud having been raised through the cavity into the shaft . The rail walls and the floor form a longitudinal channel cavity into which the boss and the latch assembly can be inserted.

After insertion of the flange and the boss into the channel cavity as shown in the second installation view the grip can then be rotated 90 clockwise to the locking position. This rotation retrieves the stud to tighten the spring and insert the flange into the linear notch .

The cap can then be tightened by turning in a clockwise direction until cinched and the fastener is secured to avoid to sliding on along the strut . Artisans of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the channel configuration of the strut is merely exemplary and not limiting to the fastener that can be configured for a structure having a cavity flanked by opposing ledges such as lips and .

The spring loaded ball on the detent engages one of the cavities on the upper surface of the grip that provide stop points for the detent . These cavities prevent accidental rotation of the cap that could otherwise loosen the fastener . Removal of the fastener entails opposite operational steps of installation using counter clockwise rotations.

One of the platforms and may be disposed between the lower surface and the lips and for disposal on the strut . Internal orifices also extend through the surface . shows another isometric view of the grip assembly showing the stop insert secured within the slot . Screws at the longitudinal ends of the stop insert pass through the orifices . The stop insert presents a flat surface within the central orifice to provide a rotation restraint.

As the grip turns clockwise the stud ascends to retract through the annular shaft disposed within the annular cavity . Further retraction translates the stud into the central orifice aligning its distal flat or spiral surface to abut against the insert s flat surface and inhibit further rotation of the grip .

For various exemplary embodiments the grip of the base assembly inserts into the base assembly within which to rotate 90 to engage and disengage with the strut . The stop insert inserts into the grip and engages the flat surface against a corresponding surface on the stud . This transfers the rotation of the grip to the stud enabling the fastener to engage and disengage with the strut .

This configuration represents a mechanism to accomplish the process and that depending on construction can be manufactured as a unitary component. The cap can be threaded to accept the stud and tighten the stud to lock the fastener to the strut . To prevent accidental loosening the detent can be installed in the cap and provides a friction spring lock that engages the grip while the cap remains tight.

The spring is uncompressed while the grip assembly remains flaccid and compressed when the grip assembly has been tightened in locking position. This condition holds tension against the cap and the grip to prevent inadvertent loosening.

Several features have been designed into the assembly to make operation simple and effective. The tab which extends 90 on the bottom surface of the grip engages the annular notch that is cut 180 on the top of the annulus to permit the grip to turn up to 90 by hand. This enables the grip to rotate a maximum of 90 so as to engage and disengage the fastener within the strut . Additionally the boss also includes the linear notch such that when tightened the flange cannot rotate and disengage the strut even if tension is removed from the mating surfaces.

The device can be constructed from a variety of materials depending on load and application in accordance with good engineering practices. For the purpose of prototyping a prototype configuration has been constructed out of a combination of aluminum and stainless steel for handling a load of approximately 50 lbf each in an extreme environment.

For lighter loads in less harsh environments lighter duty materials such as plastics or other metals could be used to reduce weight and or cost. The shape and size of the knobs can vary based on load and human systems interfacing needs such as shown in view with flat sides for easy gripping.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
