The present invention is directed towards developing a rule based named entity extraction system. More particularly the present invention provides a system and method for providing a Rapid Application Development RAD framework for developing a rule based named entity extraction system.

Rule based named entity extraction is a natural language processing technique that identifies one or more named entities present in unstructured text data based on one or more predefined rules. Examples of named entities include but are not limited to person names products organizations locations email addresses vehicles computer parts currencies temporal entities such as dates times days years months and weeks and numerical entities such as measurements percentages and monetary values. Rules are regular expressions formulated by domain experts based on writing style and terminologies of target domain of unstructured text data.

While developing a rule based named entity extraction system the rules defined by domain experts are implemented in a high level programming language such as Java C FORTRAN and PASCAL etc. by users who possess software coding skills. The users who have software coding skills are hereinafter referred to as specialists.
