title: Delayed gas-operated firearm
abstract: An auto-loading firearm may obtain improved firing precision by using stored energy to cycle the firearm. The firearm may be partially cycled when the trigger is pulled. The firearm may be completely cycled only when the trigger is released. Sound suppression and/or sound reduction may be obtained by limiting the amount of gas escaping the breech during extraction as well as separating the noise of the firing event from the noise of the action cycling.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to firearms and in particular to gas operated auto loading firearms.

In auto loading firearms the cycle of operation is initiated by pressing the trigger. Once initiated the entire cycle of operation is generally completed. In manually operated firearms on the other hand the shooter is required to manually cycle the action of the firearm for the next round to load and be ready for firing. Manually operated firearms are generally thought to be inherently more accurate than a similarly constructed auto loading firearm due to the absence of recoiling parts during firing. Precision is often considered to have been traded off in favor of the convenience and speed of auto loading.

Additionally when an auto loading firearm is fitted with a muzzle device for the purpose of suppressing the muzzle signature there is often an increase in gas pressures and volumes that exit through the breech of the firearm during the automatic cycle of operation. These increases in gas pressure and volume at the breech can result in additional noise of the cycling of the action and of gasses escaping through the breech. For these reasons the manually operated firearm is sometimes preferred over the auto loading firearm at the expense of the convenience of the auto loading firearm.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 409 883 was issued on Oct. 18 1983 to Edouard Nyst and is expressly incorporated by reference herein. The Nyst patent describes a rifle wherein the combustion gasses may be used to store energy in a spring and piston. When the gun user wishes the rifle s action to cycle a latch mechanism on the forestock of the rifle may be pressed to thereby release the stored energy and cycle the rifle. The Nyst design may not be easily adapted to other weapons such as handguns. Further the Nyst design requires the user to operate both the trigger and a separate mechanism on the forestock.

It is an object of the invention to provide a gas operated auto loading firearm wherein cycling of the firearm may be delayed and then initiated using the trigger.

In one aspect a gas operated auto loading firearm may include a barrel fixed to a receiver a trigger disposed in the receiver and biased to a forward position a bolt carrier disposed in the receiver and a locking lever disposed between the trigger and the bolt carrier. A gas piston may be slidably disposed in a gas piston chamber. The gas piston may include a head and a rear surface having a protrusion thereon.

A gas bleed line may be disposed between the barrel and the gas piston chamber. A piston catch may be disposed in the receiver and may have a downward bias. A spring loaded detent may be disposed between the piston catch and the bolt carrier. In a forward position of the bolt carrier the spring loaded detent may provide an upward bias to the piston catch that overcomes the downward bias.

A gas piston spring may be disposed between the gas piston head and a forward surface of the bolt carrier. A return spring may be disposed between the rear surface of the gas piston and a surface of the receiver.

In another aspect a method may include providing a gas operated auto loading firearm activating a trigger of the firearm compressing a gas piston spring and then cycling the firearm by deactivating the trigger of the firearm.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A gas operated auto loading firearm may combine the convenience of an auto loading firearm with the precision of a manually operated firearm by using stored energy. A gas operated auto loading firearm may store the energy from firing a round of ammunition and then later release that energy for the purpose of cycling the action of the firearm. The energy may be released as a natural function of releasing the trigger.

Operation of the firearm may be performed with the user s trigger finger through a normal application and release of the trigger. No additional training may be required because the operation of the firearm is naturally performed. The firearm may be a rifle a shotgun or a handgun.

A bolt carrier may be disposed in the receiver . Bolt carrier may carry a rotating and locking bolt or other breech locking mechanism not shown . A locking lever may be caused to move by motion of trigger . In the forward position of trigger shown in locking lever may not prevent rearward movement of bolt carrier .

A gas piston chamber may have a gas piston slidably disposed therein. A gas bleed line may be disposed between barrel and gas piston chamber . Gas piston may include a head and a rear surface . Rear surface may include a protrusion thereon. Protrusion may prevent translation of bolt carrier beyond rear surface of gas piston . Protrusion may also translate bolt carrier forward when protrusion contacts bolt carrier and gas piston is moving forward.

A piston catch may be disposed in receiver . Piston catch may be downwardly biased by for example piston catch spring . In piston catch is in an upward position. A spring loaded detent may be disposed between piston catch and bolt carrier . In the forward position of bolt carrier shown in spring loaded detent may provide an upward bias to piston catch that overcomes the downward bias provided by piston catch spring .

A gas piston spring may be disposed between gas piston head and a forward surface of bolt carrier . A return spring may be disposed between rear surface of gas piston and a surface of receiver .

In bolt carrier is closed with a round of ammunition not shown chambered in barrel . Trigger is in its forward resting position and locking lever is down. Gas piston is in its forward position. Bolt carrier is in its forward position. As seen in when trigger is operated locking lever is raised to prevent bolt carrier from moving rearward. Upon firing the projectile moves down barrel . When the projectile passes gas bleed line some portion of the propelling gasses may be bled to gas piston chamber .

As seen in the propelling gasses may then act on gas piston and may move gas piston rearward in gas piston chamber . Rearward movement of gas piston may compress gas piston spring against forward surface of bolt carrier and may compress return spring against surface of receiver . Bolt carrier may be restrained from rearward translation by the upward locking position of locking lever . Locking lever may be held in place because trigger may continue to be positioned rearward by the firearm user.

In gas piston is at full compression and has reached the end of its rearward travel. Energy from the propelling gases may be stored in compressed gas piston spring . Gas piston may be prevented from translating forward by piston catch . Piston catch was rotated downwardly by head of piston as head slid over piston catch . When head cleared piston catch piston catch was rotated upwardly by forward surface of bolt carrier acting on spring loaded detent .

Firearm may remain in the position shown in until bolt carrier is allowed to move. When the firearm user releases trigger locking lever may be rotated downwardly thereby freeing bolt carrier to move rearward under the force of compressed gas piston spring acting on forward surface . Piston catch may remain in its upward position by continued pressure from piston head . Piston catch may remain in its upward position even as bolt carrier moves rearward. Piston catch may restrain head of gas piston thereby allowing the stored energy of gas piston spring to act against bolt carrier .

Rearward movement of bolt carrier may partially cycle the firearm . Partial cycling may include unlocking the bolt not shown extracting and ejecting a spent cartridge case not shown cocking the firing components not shown and further compressing return spring . Piston catch may rotate to its downward position after bolt carrier has translated rearward and pressure from gas piston spring has been released.

When bolt carrier reaches the rearward end of its travel as shown in return spring may be compressed and protrusion on rear surface of gas piston may be in contact with bolt carrier . Compressed return spring may now translate gas piston forward. Because of the contact of the protrusion on bolt carrier bolt carrier may also be translated forward as shown in . As bolt carrier moves forward the firearm cycle of operation may be completed. For example the next round of ammunition may be chambered and the bolt not shown locked.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
