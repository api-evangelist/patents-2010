This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priorities from Patent Application Nos. 2009 021821 and 2009 131305 filed on Feb. 2 2009 and May 29 2009 respectively in the Japan Patent Office of which the contents are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a method for producing a conductive film having an electrically conductive property suitable for use as a light transmitting electromagnetic shielding film for various display devices a transparent electrode for various electronic devices a transparent planar heating element etc.

Recently a material having a transparent substrate and a mesh patterned conductive layer of a thin wire of metal or the like has been known as a conductive film having an electrically conductive property suitable for use as a light transmitting electromagnetic shielding film for various display devices a transparent electrode for various electronic devices a transparent planar heating element etc. Known methods for producing the material include the following.

Among the above three methods the method of 3 using the silver halide is advantageous in that it contains simpler processes as compared with the photolithography method can form a thin wire more easily as compared with the printing method and is suitable for forming a continuous seamless conductive layer. The surface resistance of the conductive film prepared from such a photosensitive material containing a silver salt particularly a silver halide can be sufficiently lowered by a smoothing treatment using a calender roll. Furthermore the method can easily form a metallic silver portion with a desired pattern and uniform shape advantageously to improve the conductive film productivity see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 251417 etc. 

In a case where a conductive film precursor prepared from a photosensitive material having a silver salt containing emulsion layer particularly a conductive film precursor using a long support having a thickness of 95 m or more is subjected to a smoothing treatment using a calender roll deformation defect caused due to wrinkling must be taken into consideration. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 251417 describes a combination of a metal roll and a plastic roll capable of preventing the wrinkling.

However consideration of not only the combination of the metal and plastic rolls but also a force for conveying the conductive film precursor is required in view of preventing the wrinkling.

In view of the above problems an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a conductive film using a photosensitive material having a silver salt containing emulsion layer particularly a conductive film using a long support having a thickness of 95 m or more which is capable of reducing deformation defect caused due to wrinkling in a smoothing treatment using a calender roll thereby improving the quality and productivity of the conductive film.

 1 A method for producing a conductive film according to the present invention comprising a metallic silver forming step of exposing and developing a photosensitive material comprising a long support and thereon an emulsion layer containing a silver salt thereby forming a metallic silver portion to prepare a conductive film precursor and a smoothing treatment step of subjecting the conductive film precursor to a smoothing treatment to produce a conductive film wherein that the support has a thickness of 95 m or more the conductive film precursor is pressed by a first calender roll and a second calender roll facing each other in the smoothing treatment the first calender roll is a resin roll and is brought into contact with the support and the method satisfies the condition of 1 212 1 wherein P represents a conveying force applied when the conductive film precursor is introduced to an area where the smoothing treatment step is conducted and P represents a conveying force applied when the smoothing treated conductive film is discharged from the area where the smoothing treatment step is conducted.

 4 A method according to the present invention wherein the photosensitive material has a thickness of 100 to 200 m.

 5 A method according to the present invention wherein the conductive film has a length of 2 m or more.

 6 A method according to the present invention wherein the second calender roll is a metal roll and is brought into contact with the metallic silver portion.

 9 A method according to the present invention wherein the emulsion layer has a silver binder volume ratio of 1 1 or more.

 10 A method according to the present invention wherein the smoothing treatment is carried out while applying a load line pressure of 200 to 600 kgf cm 1960 to 5880 N cm to the conductive film precursor.

 11 A method according to the present invention wherein the smoothing treatment is carried out while conveying the conductive film precursor at a conveying rate of 10 to 50 m minute.

When the conductive film using the photosensitive material having the silver salt containing emulsion layer particularly the conductive film using the long support having a thickness of 95 m or more is produced by the production method of the present invention the deformation defect caused due to the wrinkling can be prevented in the smoothing treatment using the calender roll to improve the quality and productivity of the film.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.

The conductive film producing method of the present invention will be described below. The conductive film produced by the method of the present invention can be used in a defroster defrosting device a window glass etc. for a vehicle and be used as a heating sheet generating heat by flowing an electric current an electrode for a touch panel an inorganic EL device an organic EL device or a solar cell or a printed board. It should be noted that in this description a numeric range of A to B includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower and upper limit values.

The support of the photosensitive material used in the production method of the present invention may be a plastic film a plastic plate a glass plate etc. Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates PET and polyethylene naphthalates polyolefins such as polyethylenes PE polypropylenes PP polystyrenes and EVA vinyl resins such as polyvinyl chlorides and polyvinylidene chlorides polyether ether ketones PEEK polysulfones PSF polyether sulfones PES polycarbonates PC polyamides polyimides acrylic resins and triacetyl celluloses TAC .

The thickness of the support is 95 m or more and is preferably at most 150 m. In the method of the present invention the conductive film containing the long support having a thickness of 95 m or more can be smoothing treated using the calender roll while preventing deformation defect caused due to wrinkling. In general when the support has a thickness of 100 m or more the deformation defect is readily caused due to the wrinkling. In the present invention the deformation defect due to the wrinkling can be sufficiently prevented even under such a condition.

The photosensitive material used in the production method of the present invention has the support and thereon the emulsion layer containing the silver salt the silver salt containing layer as a light sensor. The silver salt containing layer may contain a binder a solvent etc. in addition to the silver salt. Unless some question arises the emulsion layer containing the silver salt or the silver salt containing layer may be simply referred to as the emulsion layer.

The emulsion layer may be formed by applying an emulsion a liquid containing a binder a solvent etc. in addition to the silver salt to the support. The emulsion may be temporarily stored in a storage tank and a required amount of the emulsion may be discharged from the tank and introduced through a liquid delivery device to the application process. The liquid delivery device is preferably a reciprocating pump and specific examples thereof include plunger pumps and diaphragm pumps.

The plunger pump has a sliding part between a piston and a cylinder. In a case where the emulsion contains a large amount of a binder such as a gelatin the silver halide is protected by the gelatin and thereby is not affected by the sliding motion of the plunger pump. However in a case where the emulsion contains a large amount of silver for example at a silver binder volume ratio of 1.5 1 to 4 1 the binder content is small whereby reduced silver is readily generated due to the pressure sensitivity during the sliding motion. As a result the reduced silver contaminates the coating layer the emulsion layer so that undesirable spots so called black pepper are generated in unexposed areas in the development process.

The diaphragm pump has a similar structure to the plunger pump and is different in that an elastic flexible membrane a diaphragm a membrane composed of a rubber or the like is used instead of the piston. Even in a case where the emulsion contains a large amount of silver for example at a silver binder volume ratio of 1.5 1 to 4 1 the diaphragm pump can preferably transfer the liquid without the pressure sensitive reduction because of the absence of the sliding part.

Thus the plunger or diaphragm pump may be used for transferring an emulsion containing a small amount of silver for example at a silver binder volume ratio of 0.25 1 to 1 1 and the diaphragm pump is preferably used for transferring an emulsion containing a large amount of silver for example at a silver binder volume ratio of 1.5 1 to 4 1. A seal composed of a fluorocarbon resin such as a polytetrafluoroethylene is particularly preferably used for pressing the diaphragm. Such a seal is excellent in sealing property and thereby can prevent leakage of the emulsion to be transferred and incorporation of air etc.

The emulsion layer may exhibit a swelling ratio of 250 or more. In the present invention the swelling ratio is defined by the following equation. Swelling ratio 100 

In the above equation a represents the thickness of the emulsion layer in the dry state and b represents the thickness of the emulsion layer after dipping the layer in distilled water at 25 C. for 1 minute.

For example the dry emulsion layer thickness of a may be measured by observing a cross section of a sample using a scanning electron microscope. The swelled emulsion layer thickness of b may be measured by freeze drying a swelled sample using liquid nitrogen and then observing a cross section of the sample using a scanning electron microscope.

In the present invention it is preferred that the emulsion layer of the photosensitive material exhibits the swelling of 250 or more. The preferred swelling ratio range varies depending on the silver binder volume ratio of the emulsion layer. In the film the silver halide cannot be swelled while a binder portion can be swelled. The binder portion exhibits a constant swelling ratio regardless of the silver binder volume ratio. However as the silver binder volume ratio is increased the swelling ratio of the entire emulsion layer is lowered. In the present invention the swelling ratio of the emulsion layer is preferably 250 or more when the silver binder volume ratio of the emulsion layer is 4 or less the swelling ratio is preferably 200 or more when the silver binder volume ratio is 4.5 or more but less than 6 and the swelling ratio is preferably 150 or more when the silver binder volume ratio is 6 or more.

The emulsion layer may contain a dye a binder a solvent etc. if necessary in addition to the silver salt. Each component in the emulsion layer will be described below.

The photosensitive material may contain a dye in at least the emulsion layer. The dye is used in the emulsion layer as a filter dye or for a purpose of irradiation prevention etc. The dye may be a solid dispersion dye. Preferred examples of the dyes useful in the present invention are described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 251417 and therefore the explanation of the examples is herein omitted. The mass ratio of the dye to the total solid contents in the emulsion layer is preferably 0.01 to 10 by mass more preferably 0.1 to 5 by mass in view of effects such as the irradiation prevention effect and sensitivity reduction due to excess addition.

The silver salt used in the present invention may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate. In the present invention the silver halide is preferred because of its excellent light sensing property.

In the present invention the silver halide excellent in the light sensing property is preferred. Silver halide technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be utilized in the present invention.

The silver halide may contain a halogen element of chlorine bromine iodine or fluorine and may contain a combination of the elements. For example the silver halide preferably contains AgCl AgBr or AgI more preferably contains AgBr or AgCl as a main component. The silver halide may contain silver chlorobromide silver iodochlorobromide or silver iodobromide. The silver halide is more preferably silver chlorobromide silver bromide silver iodochlorobromide or silver iodobromide most preferably silver chlorobromide or silver iodochlorobromide having a silver chloride content of 50 mol or more.

The average particle size of the silver halide particles is preferably 0.1 to 1000 nm 1 m more preferably 0.1 to 100 nm further preferably 1 to 50 nm in spherical equivalent diameter in view of the image quality of the patterned metallic silver layer formed after the exposure and development. The spherical equivalent diameter of the silver halide particle means a diameter of a spherical particle having the same volume as the silver halide particle.

The silver halide emulsion used as a coating liquid for the emulsion layer in the present invention may be prepared by a method described in P. Glafkides Chimie et Physique Photographique Paul Montel 1967 G. F. Dufin Photographic Emulsion Chemistry The Forcal Press 1966 V. L. Zelikman et al. Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion The Forcal Press 1964 etc.

A binder may be used in the emulsion layer to uniformly disperse the silver salt particles and to help the emulsion layer adhere to the support. In the present invention though the binder may contain a water insoluble polymer and a water soluble polymer it is preferred that the binder has a high content of a water soluble component that can be removed by dipping in a hot water or bringing into contact with a water vapor as described hereinafter.

Examples of the binders include gelatins carrageenans polyvinyl alcohols PVA polyvinyl pyrolidones PVP polysaccharides such as starches celluloses and derivatives thereof polyethylene oxides polysaccharides polyvinylamines chitosans polylysines polyacrylic acids polyalginic acids polyhyaluronic acids and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral anionic or cationic property due to ionicity of a functional group.

The binder preferably comprises a gelatin. The gelatin may be a lime treated gelatin or an acid treated gelatin and may be a hydrolyzed gelatin an enzymatically decomposed gelatin or a gelatin modified by an amino or carboxyl group such as a phthalated gelatin or an acetylated gelatin . The gelatin used in the preparation of the silver salt is preferably such that the positive charge of an amino group is converted to the uncharged or negatively charged state. It is further preferable to use the phthalated gelatin additionally.

The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.3 m or less. The method of applying or forming the protective layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known coating methods.

The method for producing the conductive film using the above photosensitive material will be described below.

In the conductive film producing method of the present invention first the photosensitive material comprising the support and thereon the silver salt containing emulsion layer is exposed and developed. Then the metallic silver portion formed by the development is subjected to the smoothing treatment such as a calender treatment. In the formation of the metallic silver portion a light transmitting portion or an insulating portion may be formed in addition to the metallic silver portion or alternatively the metallic silver portion may be formed on the entire film surface by entire surface exposure. In the conductive film produced by the method of the present invention the metal portion may be formed on the support by pattern exposure. In the pattern exposure a scanning exposure method or a surface exposure method may be used. The metallic silver portion may be formed in an exposed area or an unexposed area.

The pattern shape details may be appropriately selected depending on the intended use. For example the pattern may be a mesh pattern for producing an electromagnetic shielding film or a wiring pattern for producing a printed board.

The conductive film producing method of the present invention includes the following three embodiments different in the photosensitive materials and development treatments.

A negative development treatment or a reversal development treatment can be used in the embodiments. In the diffusion transfer development the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto positive photosensitive material.

The chemical development thermal development solution physical development and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin ichi Kikuchi Shashin Kagaku Photographic Chemistry Kyoritsu Shuppan Co. Ltd. and C. E. K. Mees The Theory of Photographic Process 4th ed. 

In the production method of the present invention the silver salt containing layer formed on the support is exposed. The layer may be exposed using an electromagnetic wave. For example a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light or a radiation ray such as an X ray may be used to generate the electromagnetic wave. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength. The irradiation light may be applied in a mesh pattern for producing an electromagnetic shielding film or in a wiring pattern for producing a printed board.

In the production method of the present invention the silver salt containing layer is subjected to a development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention. A developer for the development treatment is not particularly limited and may be a PQ developer an MQ developer an MAA developer etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN 16 CR 56 CP45X FD 3 and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation C 41 E 6 RA 4 Dsd 19 and D 72 available from Eastman Kodak Company and developers contained in kits thereof. The developer may be a lith developer such as D85 available from Eastman Kodak Company.

In the production method of the present invention by the exposure and development treatments the metallic silver portion is formed in the exposed area and the light transmitting portion to be hereinafter described is formed in the unexposed area. If necessary the conductivity of the film may be increased by water washing of the sample to remove a binder following the development treatment. In the present invention the development fixation and water washing are preferably carried out at 25 C. or lower.

In the production method of the present invention the development process may contain a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed area to stabilize the material. Common fixation treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention.

The developer for the development treatment may contain an image quality improver for improving the image quality. Examples of the image quality improvers include nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as benzotriazole. Particularly a polyethylene glycol is preferably used for the lith developer.

The mass ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed area after the development to the silver contained in this area before the exposure is preferably 50 or more more preferably 80 or more by mass. When the mass ratio is 50 by mass or more a high conductivity can be easily achieved.

After the development treatment the metallic silver portion in the exposed area contains silver and a non conductive macromolecule and the volume ratio of silver non conductive macromolecule is preferably 2 1 or more more preferably 3 1 or more.

In the present invention a tone gradation obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0 though not particularly restrictive. When the tone after the development is more than 4.0 the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining high transparency of the light transmitting portion. For example the tone of 4.0 or more can be achieved by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.

In the production method of the present invention the metallic silver portion formed by the development is preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example a small amount of a metal deposited on the light transmitting portion can be removed by the oxidation treatment so that the transmittance of the light transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100 .

For example the oxidation treatment may be carried out by a known method using an oxidant such as Fe III ion. The oxidation treatment may be carried out after the exposure and development treatments of the silver salt containing layer.

In the present invention the metallic silver portion may be treated with a Pd containing solution after the exposure and development treatments. The Pd may be in the state of divalent palladium ion or metal palladium. A black color of the metallic silver portion can be prevented from changing with time owing to this treatment.

In the production method of the present invention the mesh metallic silver portion having particular line width opening ratio and silver content is formed directly on the support by the exposure and development treatments and thereby can exhibit a satisfactory surface resistivity. Therefore it is unnecessary to subject the metallic silver portion to further physical development and or plating to increase the conductivity. Thus in the present invention the light transmitting conductive film can be produced by the simple process.

As described above the light transmitting conductive film according to the present invention can be used in a defroster defrosting device a window glass etc. for a vehicle a heating sheet for heat generation under an electric current an electrode for a touch panel an inorganic EL device an organic EL device or a solar cell or a printed board.

A desirable film with high conductivity can be obtained by dipping the photosensitive material in an aqueous reducing solution after the development treatment. The aqueous reducing solution may be an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite hydroquinone p phenylenediamine oxalic acid etc. The aqueous solution preferably has pH of 10 or more.

In the production method of the present invention the metallic silver portion the entire surface metallic silver portion patterned metal mesh portion or patterned metal wiring portion is subjected to the smoothing treatment after the development. The conductivity of the metallic silver portion can be significantly increased by the smoothing treatment. When the areas of the metallic silver portion and the light transmitting portion are appropriately designed the resultant conductive film can have an electrically conductive property suitable for use as a light transmitting electromagnetic shielding film having a high electromagnetic shielding property a high light transmittability and a black mesh portion as a transparent electrode for various electronic devices or as a transparent planar heating element etc.

The smoothing treatment may be carried out using a calender roll unit. The calender roll unit generally has a pair of rolls. The smoothing treatment using the calender roll unit is hereinafter referred to as the calender treatment.

The roll used in the calender treatment may be a metal roll or a resin roll such as an epoxy polyimide polyamide or polyimide amide resin roll. Particularly in a case where the photosensitive material has the emulsion layer only on one side it is preferred that the calender treatment is carried out under the following conditions to prevent the wrinkling.

When the conductive film using the photosensitive material having the silver salt containing emulsion layer particularly the conductive film using the long support having a thickness of 95 m or more is produced by performing the smoothing treatment using the calender roll in this manner the deformation defect caused due to the wrinkling can be prevented in the smoothing treatment to improve the quality and productivity of the film. In addition the deformation defect due to the wrinkling can be prevented even in a case where the conductive film has a length of 2 m or more.

It is further preferred that the calender treatment is carried out under at least one of the following conditions.

The temperature at which the calender treatment is carried out is preferably 10 C. without temperature control to 100 C. Though the preferred temperature range is different depending on the density and shape of the mesh or wiring metal pattern the type of the binder etc. in general the temperature is more preferably 10 C. without temperature control to 50 C.

As described above the high conductive film having a surface resistance of less than 1.9 sq can be easily produced with low costs by the production method of the present invention.

Thus in the conductive film producing method of the present invention by exposing and developing the photosensitive material having the support and the silver salt containing layer formed thereon to form the metallic silver portion containing 0.1 to 10 g mof silver the conductive film having a surface resistance of less than 1.9 can be obtained without forming a further conductive layer on the metallic silver portion.

In the production method of the present invention after the conductive metal portion is formed on the support zthe resultant may be dipped in a hot water or a heated water having a higher temperature or brought into contact with a water vapor. By this treatment the conductivity and the transparency can be easily improved in a short time. It is considered that the water soluble binder is partly removed whereby bindings between the metals the conductive substances are increased. This treatment is desirably carried out after the smoothing treatment though may be carried out after the development treatment.

The temperature of the hot water or the heated water having a higher temperature in which the support is dipped is preferably 60 C. to 100 C. more preferably 80 C. to 100 C. The temperature of the water vapor with which the support is brought into contact is preferably 100 C. to 140 C. at 1 atm. The time of the treatment of dipping in the hot water or the heated water having a higher temperature or being in contact with the water vapor depends on the type of the water soluble binder used. When the support has a size of 60 cm 1 m the treatment time is preferably about 10 seconds to 5 minutes more preferably about 1 to 5 minutes.

In the present invention the metallic silver portion is subjected to the smoothing treatment and may be subjected to a plating treatment. By the plating treatment the surface resistance can be further reduced and the conductivity can be further increased. The smoothing treatment may be carried out before or after the plating treatment. When the smoothing treatment is carried out before the plating treatment the plating treatment can be more efficiently carried out to form a uniform plated layer. The plating treatment may be an electrolytic or electroless plating treatment. The material for the plated layer is preferably a metal with a sufficient conductivity such as copper.

The present invention may be appropriately combined with technologies described in the following Laid Open Patent Publications and International Pamphlets shown in Tables 1 and 2. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. Pamphlet No. and the like are omitted.

The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples. Materials amounts ratios treatment contents treatment procedures and the like used in Examples may be appropriately changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following specific examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.

The potassium hexachloroiridate III 0.005 KCl 20 aqueous solution and the ammonium hexachlororhodate 0.001 NaCl 20 aqueous solution in Liquid 3 were prepared by dissolving a complex powder in a 20 aqueous solution of KCl or NaCl and by heating the resultant solution at 40 C. for 120 minutes respectively.

Liquid 1 was maintained at 38 C. and pH 4.5 and Liquids 2 and 3 were simultaneously added to Liquid 1 over 20 minutes under stirring in an amount of 90 of the total to form 0.16 m nuclear particles.

In the obtained coating sample the emulsion layer had a silver binder volume ratio silver GEL ratio vol of 1 1. Thus the emulsion layer satisfied the silver binder volume ratio condition of 1 1 or more preferably used in the photosensitive material for forming the conductive film according to the present invention.

The dried coating was exposed to a parallel light from a light source of a high pressure mercury lamp through a photomask having a lattice patterned space line space 195 m 5 m pitch 200 m . The photomask was capable of forming a patterned developed silver image line space m 195 m . Then the coating was subjected to a treatment containing development fixation water washing and drying.

The sample was transferred between the metal roll and the resin roll whereby the sample was calender treated at a load of 200 kgf cm 1960 N cm to obtain a conductive film of Example 1. In this process the introduction conveying force P the conveying force applied when the sample was introduced to the area where the calender treatment step was conducted was 20 kg width and the discharge conveying force P the conveying force applied when the calender treated sample was discharged from the area where the calender treatment step was conducted was 20 kg width so that P P was 1. The sample was transferred at a conveying rate of 10 m minute.

A conductive film of Example 2 was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 400 kgf cm 3920 N cm .

Incidence of wrinkling in the calender treated films of Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7 were visually observed and evaluated. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3. As shown in Table 3 in Examples 1 to 6 the metal roll faced the metallic silver portion the resin roll faced the support and the ratio of the introduction conveying force P to the discharge conveying force P P P satisfied the condition of 1 2 P P 1 whereby the wrinkling was not found. In contrast in Comparative Example 1 to 7 each sample was calender treated using the pair of metal rolls and the ratio of the introduction conveying force P to the discharge conveying force P P P did not satisfy the condition of 1 2 P P 1 whereby the wrinkling was observed.

A mirror finished metal roll was used in Examples 11 to 15 an embossed metal roll was used in Examples 16 to 20 and the surface resistance decrease rates were measured under various loads to evaluate the difference between the metal rolls. The emulsion preparation the coating sample production the exposure and development treatments and the reduction treatment were carried out in the same manner as Example 1.

The surface resistance of each sample according to Examples 11 to 20 was measured before the calender treatment after the fixation and after the calender treatment. The surface resistances of 10 areas optionally selected in each sample were measured by LORESTA GP Model No. MCP T610 manufactured by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd. utilizing an in line four probe method ASP and the average of the measured values was used for the surface resistance evaluation. The measurement results of Examples 11 to 20 are shown in Table 4 with details.

Calender treated conductive films were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the support had a thickness of 90 120 or 150 m. Also the conductive films had no wrinkling. In general when the support has a large thickness the wrinkling is readily caused. In the present invention the wrinkling can be prevented by controlling the conveying force.

A metal roll which had an iron core plated with a hard chrome a mirror finished surface and a roll diameter of 250 mm was used as a calender roll to be in contact with the metallic silver portion and a resin roll which had an iron core coated with an epoxy resin and a roll diameter of 250 mm was used as a calender roll to be in contact with the support. The sample was transferred between the metal roll and the resin roll whereby the sample was calender treated at a load of 200 kgf cm 1960 N cm to obtain a conductive film of Example 11. In this process the introduction conveying force P was 20 kg width and the discharge conveying force P was 20 kg width so that P P was 1. The sample was transferred at a conveying rate of 10 m minute. The sample had a surface resistance of 1.845 sq before the calender treatment after the fixation and had a surface resistance of 1.246 sq after the calender treatment so that the decrease rate was 1.246 1.845 0.68 i.e. decreased by 32 .

A conductive film of Example 12 was produced in the same manner as Example 11 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 300 kgf cm 2940 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 0.862 1.41 0.61 i.e. decreased by 39 .

A conductive film of Example 13 was produced in the same manner as Example 11 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 400 kgf cm 3920 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 0.914 1.533 0.60 i.e. decreased by 40 .

A conductive film of Example 16 was produced in the same manner as Example 11 except that a metal roll which had an iron core plated with a hard chrome an embossed surface a surface roughness Rmax of 0.05 to 0.8 s and a roll diameter of 250 mm was used as the calender roll brought into contact with the metallic silver portion and a resin roll which had an iron core coated with an epoxy resin and a roll diameter of 250 mm was used as the calender roll brought into contact with the support. In this case the decrease rate was 1.336 1.74 0.77 i.e. decreased by 23 .

A conductive film of Example 17 was produced in the same manner as Example 16 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 300 kgf cm 2940 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 1.162 1.716 0.68 i.e. decreased by 32 .

A conductive film of Example 18 was produced in the same manner as Example 16 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 400 kgf cm 3920 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 1.266 1.642 0.77 i.e. decreased by 23 .

A conductive film of Example 19 was produced in the same manner as Example 16 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 500 kgf cm 4900 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 1.192 1.804 0.66 i.e. decreased by 34 .

A conductive film of Example 20 was produced in the same manner as Example 16 except that the calender treatment was carried out under a load of 600 kgf cm 5880 N cm . In this case the decrease rate was 1.212 1.743 0.70 i.e. decreased by 30 .

As shown in Table 4 Examples 11 to 20 satisfied the condition of 0.58 R R 0.77 in which R represents the surface resistance of the conductive film precursor and R represents the surface resistance of the conductive film and thus the surface resistance was efficiently reduced in these cases. The films of Examples 16 to 20 using the embossed metal roll exhibited the decrease rates lower than those of the films of Examples 11 to 15 using the mirror finished metal roll. This is attributed to the fact that each sample was not uniformly pressed by the combination of the rough embossed surface and the resin surface and that the silver density of the metallic silver portion fails to be increased.

As a liquid delivery device for transferring the prepared emulsion a plunger pump was used in Reference Examples 1 to 6 and a diaphragm pump was used in Examples 21 to 26. The number of black spots black peppers generated per unit area of each film number mm was visually counted using a microscope. The results are shown in Table 5.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the emulsion had a silver binder volume ratio of 0.25 1.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the emulsion had a silver binder volume ratio of 0.5 1.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 the emulsion having a silver binder volume ratio of 1 1.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the emulsion had a silver binder volume ratio of 1.5 1.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the emulsion had a silver binder volume ratio of 2 1.

Each conductive film was produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the emulsion had a silver binder volume ratio of 4 1.

As shown in Table 5 among Reference Examples 1 to 6 using the plunger pump black spots were generated in Reference Examples 3 to 6 using the emulsions having silver binder volume ratios of 1 1 or more. Particularly as the silver binder volume ratio of the emulsion was increased the number of black spots was increased in an exponential manner.

In contrast in Examples 21 to 26 using the diaphragm pump black spots were not generated within the measurement range i.e. the silver binder volume ratio range of 0.25 1 to 4 1 .

It is clear from the results that the diaphragm pump is preferred for transferring an emulsion having a high silver content such as a silver binder volume ratio of 1.5 1 to 4 1.

It should be understood that the conductive film producing method of the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention.
