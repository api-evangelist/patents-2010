The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to the handling of large caliber ammunition for example ammunition larger than 40 mm caliber.

A large diameter bearing turret ring may be mounted on the deck of a combat vehicle. A turret structure including a gun may be horizontally rotatable with the turret ring. A basket may also be mounted on the turret ring. The basket may extend downwardly into the vehicle hull. The basket may rotate with the turret ring and the gun. The basket may carry items incident to gun operations.

Large caliber guns were traditionally loaded by hand. Many autoloaders have been designed and built each having varying configurations and characteristics. Known autoloaders may require that the gun be moved to a particular azimuth and elevation usually 0 degrees azimuth and about 0 degrees elevation to be loaded. So the gun may be required to go off target for loading. Moving a large caliber gun may take significant time especially moving in the azimuth because the entire turret may be rotating. Also in some tank configurations moving the gun may also move the sight off target because many sights may have limited azimuth in relation to the turret position.

Other known autoloaders may have several ready rounds in the turret with a larger supply of rounds in the tank chassis. Only the ready rounds may be loaded at any azimuth and usually a fixed elevation. The ready rounds add to the weight of the rotating turret.

A need exists for an autoloader that may allow loading at any azimuth of the gun and a fixed elevation for all available rounds without adding significant weight to the turret.

It is an object of the invention to provide a large caliber autoloader that may load a gun at any azimuth.

One aspect of the invention is an autoloader having a rotatable turntable and an elevator that rotates with the turntable. The elevator may include a track. A carriage may be linearly translatable on the track of the elevator in directions toward and away from a plane of the turntable. A transfer device may be rotatably fixed to a pivot of the carriage. The transfer device may include a rail and a gripper that is linearly translatable on the rail.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus that includes a vehicle hull having a rotatable turret ring. A basket may be suspended from and rotate with the turret ring. An autoloader may be disposed in the basket. The turntable of the autoloader may rotate independent of the turret ring. An ammunition magazine may be disposed in the vehicle hull. The ammunition magazine may include an access port.

A further aspect of the invention is an autoloader having a rotatable turntable. A base may be fixed to and rotatable with the turntable. A crank case may be rotatably fixed to the base. A yoke may be rotatably fixed to the crank case. A transfer device may be rotatably fixed to the yoke. The transfer device may include a rail and a gripper that is linearly translatable on the rail.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

An automatic loader may provide a means to automatically transfer ammunition from a hull mounted magazine to a chamber of a large caliber gun and may also provide a means to automatically transfer ammunition from the chamber of the gun back to the magazine. An automatic loader may provide a means to easily upload ammunition to the magazine from an ammunition supply source. An automatic loader may provide a means to dispose of a spent cartridge case. An automatic loader may minimize the volume swept by the automatic loader during operation.

An automatic loader for large caliber ammunition may include a transfer device mounted on an elevating and positioning device. The transfer device may be rotatable within a turret basket by means of a turntable. The turntable may rotate independently of the basket to multiple positions. The automatic loader may perform one or more of the following functions among others retrieve ammunition from an active magazine in the hull align the ammunition with a cannon position load the ammunition into the cannon download the ammunition out of the cannon retract to a stowed position during firing of the cannon catch a spent cartridge case eject the spent cartridge case from the vehicle and transfer ammunition from an external ammunition supply to a magazine located on a vehicle with the automatic loader.

The loading of ammunition into the cannon and the downloading of ammunition out of the cannon may occur at any turret azimuth angle. The loading of ammunition into the cannon and the downloading of ammunition out of the cannon may occur at a fixed elevation angle of the cannon or gun.

A gun may be mounted to a turret structure the entire turret structure is not shown via trunnions . The elevation of gun may be varied by rotation about trunnions . The turret structure may include a turret ring that may be mounted to the deck of the hull . The turret ring may be horizontally rotatable with respect to the hull to thereby point the gun . The turret structure may include a basket that may rotate with the gun and the turret ring .

An automatic loader in accordance with the invention may be mounted in the basket . The automatic loader may retrieve ammunition from a magazine . Magazine may be integral to the hull . The magazine may be an active type of magazine which internally positions the ammunition as required for retrieval at a magazine port .

Referring now to the automatic loader may include a transfer device having a gripper . Gripper may be slidable on rail . The transfer device may be mounted on a carriage and may rotate vertically on the carriage . A servomotor may power the vertical rotation of the transfer device . The carriage may move linearly on an elevator . The carriage may be guided by tracks on the elevator . Autoloader may include a turntable that rotates concentric with but independently of the basket . The elevator may rotate with the turntable .

Subsequent to firing the spent cartridge case must be removed. Referring to a case catcher may be attached to the turntable . In the turntable has been rotated from its prior position at firing to horizontally align the case catcher with the plane of the gun . Now the breech may be opened and the cartridge case may be forcefully ejected by the extractors not shown into the case catcher . The turntable may now rotate back to the re arm position to begin the next cycle.

Referring now to with the turntable positioned for re arm the case catcher may simultaneously be aligned with an eject port . The eject port may be fixed to the vehicle hull . The spent cartridge may leave the case catcher and be ejected through the eject port .

The autoloader may also automatically re stock the magazine with ammunition. Or the autoloader may remove all remaining ammunition from the magazine . Referring now to a cartridge may be manually inserted into an upload port at the side of the vehicle hull . The gripper now aligned with the upload port may capture the round and withdraw the round into the transfer device . The turntable may then rotate to align the transfer device with the magazine port . The round may then be inserted in the magazine port . The magazine may then index to provide space for the next round while the transfer device may return to the upload port to repeat the cycle.

Referring now to it may be seen that the allowable recoil stroke or gun recoil zone of the gun may be limited by the presence of the transfer device . To accommodate guns having longer recoil strokes an alternate embodiment of an autoloader is shown in .

Referring to an autoloader may include a transfer device as heretofore described. Transfer device may be rotatably mounted on a yoke . For example transfer device may rotate about axis A A. The yoke may be rotatably mounted to a crank case . For example the yoke may rotate about axis B B. A servomotor may be mounted to a base that is fixed for rotation with the turntable . Servomotor may rotate the crank case relative to the base via a shaft .

Referring now to autoloader may include a first gear that is fixed to and rotatable with yoke . A second gear the same size or similar in size to the first gear may be fixed to the base . First gear may be linked to second gear via an intermediate gear . Intermediate gear may be mounted in the crank case and may mesh with the first gear and the second gear .

When the crank case is rotated by servomotor in a clockwise direction for example the interaction of the first gear the second gear and the intermediate gear may cause the yoke to rotate in the opposite counter clockwise direction. Thus the transfer device may remain horizontally oriented throughout the rotation of the crank case . In the position shown in the transfer device is positioned outside of the recoil zone of the gun .

The other functional positions of the transfer device that were described with reference to the autoloader may also be achieved with the autoloader .

Because the autoloader of the invention does not require that ready rounds be stored in the turret the turret may have less swept volume than autoloaders that include ready rounds. In addition the basket may be moved easier than known turrets because it is significantly lighter and of lower inertia than known turrets.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
