No. 60 341 548 filed on Dec. 17 2001 the entire contents of which are each incorporated by reference herein.

This invention relates generally to a game and more particularly to an electronic game that simulates the game of roulette and still more particular to an electronic roulette game that provides a player the opportunity to play multiple roulette wheels simultaneously make the same betting choice for all wheels and or select multiple winning numbers for each wheel.

Roulette is a game of chance that has been played it is believed in various forms since the 18century. Traditional roulette is played in casinos on a table wherein the wheel is set near the middle of the table. The outer wheel area is divided into 37 spaces in Europe and 38 spaces in the United States. Each space has outer walls defining sectors so that the ball can come to rest within a sector after the wheel stops spinning. The sectors alternate between the color red and the color black and are numbered from 1 to 36. There is also a 0 green or white and a 00 in the United States version .

The table includes a roulette betting felt configuration for making betting selections which has among other things numbered red and black squares corresponding to the wheel for placing bets on the outcome of the resting place of the ball after the wheel stops spinning. A winning number is the outcome of the roulette wheel in the form of one of the numbers selected by the roulette wheel regardless of whether it matches the player s wager. A winning bet occurs when the player s selection or bet includes a winning number .

As indicated above certain of the numbers and spaces on the roulette betting felt such as 2 4 6 8 10 11 13 15 17 20 22 24 26 28 29 31 33 and 35 are colored black while others such as 1 3 5 7 9 12 14 16 18 19 21 23 25 27 32 34 and 36 are colored red. Also included on the betting felt are spaces for such bets as manqu 1 to 18 inclusive pass 19 to 36 inclusive pair an even number impair an odd number rouge a red number and noir a black number . Therefore the winning bet may be comprised of a bet on the particular winning number a bet on a range of numbers that includes the winning number e.g. on odd or the 212 or a bet on a color that includes a winning number.

All bets are placed against the house and are indicated by placing stakes e.g. chips on the particular numbers or types of bets selected as they appear on the table. Once the bets are placed the croupier spins the wheel in one direction and tosses the ball onto the wheel in the other direction. The sector where the ball finally comes to rest is the outcome thereby indicating the winning number and color. This information is then used to manually determine which of the bets are winning bets. Various betting combinations with different odds and maximum bets are allowed depending on the rules of the gaming establishment. The standard odds and payouts for traditional roulette are well known in the art.

While roulette may be played in among other places most casinos traditional versions of roulette are somewhat slow moving and hence can be lacking in player interest. Several prior art games have attempted to provide interesting variations on conventional roulette.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 209 869 to Mathews discloses an apparatus and method for playing a roulette type game. The apparatus includes a conventional roulette wheel and four tables. Each table has a lower playing field and an upper playing field wherein each field is utilized for placing bets. During play four balls are utilized on the one wheel wherein each ball corresponds to one of the tables. The lower field is utilized for placing bets on the single ball that is associated with that particular table while the upper field of each table is utilized for placing bets on all of the balls in play.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 259 616 to Bergmann discloses a coin operated gaming machine that has a roulette like number pan and a setting keyboard. In operation the player inserts one or more coins into a coin insertion slot. The player then selects which numbers the player wishes to bet on using the keyboard. After the player places a bet a random number generator randomly determines the winning number and that number is then highlighted on the number pan. The random number generator also randomly determines a win multiplier number by which the winning payout is multiplied.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 105 to Ronin et al. discloses a single player computerized roulette playing apparatus. The apparatus includes a rotatable roulette wheel that is mechanically rotated using a drive mechanism. One or more balls are put into play during the game. A roulette game field is displayed on a corresponding computer display which provides a means by which the player can place one or more bets.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 755 440 to Sher relates to an apparatus used to play roulette using multiple balls. The apparatus includes a single roulette wheel that has multiple tracks thereby permitting two or more balls to be propelled into the wheel simultaneously.

Additionally video slots and poker games have provided jackpots comprising larger than normal payoffs and or progressive payoffs which are based on the performance of more than one machine which can be linked together in an attempt to generate more interest and a perception of greater rewards. However these previously devised games do not provide the ability to play a great number of games in a short amount of time something that is increasingly important in a casino environment.

Indeed there is a constant need in the gaming industry to devise new games that keep players interested to substantially reduce the possibility that players will cease playing or reduce the amount that they play due to a perceived lack of interest or challenge. Moreover it is desirable to provide new or different variations of existing familiar games so as to overcome any reluctance to play and possibly lose at games with unfamiliar rules or strategies.

Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic game that captures the excitement of casino style roulette while providing the opportunity to bet on multiple wheels simultaneously and or provide multiple winning numbers for each roulette wheel displayed.

It is a second object of the present invention to provide a roulette type game that provides progressive or high jackpot betting opportunities so as to provide maximum interest to roulette or other wagering game players.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a roulette game that can be played in the form of a video slot machine in order to conserve valuable casino floor space and minimize game acquisition and operating costs.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a roulette game that automatically determines which wagers are winning bets and recalculates a player s remaining credits based on the outcome so as to minimize the calculations which must be performed by the player and minimize the use of casino employees.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a roulette based game that can be implemented on a video gaming machine in a casino for gambling purposes.

A still further object of the present invention is to provide an electronic roulette based game that is easy and economical to manufacture.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

The above listed objects are met or exceeded by the present electronic game wherein an electronic video roulette game is provided having at least two wheels having multiple numbers for providing an outcome. The electronic game may be played by at least one player who makes at least one selection or bet and seeks a payout when the selection includes a winning number. In order to provide visual stimulation and to emphasize the random nature of the number generation the wheels are spun or made to appear to spin during the process of randomly picking the winning numbers.

The game comprises a video or electronic display for displaying the video game an input means such as a touch screen roller ball touch pad mouse push buttons or the like operably associated with the electronic display for entering the individual number or other betting selections by the player a microprocessor for controlling the game means for randomly generating the outcome of the at least two roulette wheels at least one indicator e.g. a pay line to show the outcome of the roulette wheels and means for computing the payout based on the outcome. The electronic display may include a roulette betting felt layout for making the betting selections.

The game can further include multiple winning numbers per roulette wheel and or means for wagering on the roulette wheels. Using either multiple wheels and or multiple winning numbers per wheel results in multiple winning numbers and depending on the bets which were placed possibly multiple winning bets. The wagering means can further include means for wagering on multiple roulette wheels by making a single betting selection.

The game may also feature a bonus jackpot progressive or other special payout that may be awarded when the outcome includes a particular winning number or a winning number that is repeated a selected number of times on different wheels. For example a special payout could be made if the same number appeared three times on five roulette wheels. The special payout could be further constrained to three adjacent wheels having the same number or perhaps only the first three wheels. By making it practical for a player to play one or more roulette games simultaneously the invention allows the creation of these special wheel combination payouts.

Unlike such conventional mechanical type roulette wheels the present invention allows roulette to be played in a much smaller space. In fact it enables the game to be played in the form of a standard slot machine. Moreover with the present invention the player can play many wheels at once unlike conventional roulette games where at most it is feasible to play one or two roulette wheels at the same time. The present invention is also much more likely to be lower in cost and maintenance when compared with roulette games that depend on mechanical wheels.

A method is also provided for playing roulette on one or more roulette wheels having numbers for producing an outcome wherein the method comprises the steps of selecting the roulette number or combination of numbers to be played e.g. the first twelve numbers or all black numbers selecting the number of roulette wheels to be played selecting the number of winning numbers per wheel wagering on the selections determining the outcome of the roulette wheels and computing the amount of the payout based on the outcome.

Wagering is made on multiple roulette wheels by placing a single wager. The player chooses the wager amount the number of wheels to play and the number of winning numbers per wheel. Hence the number of wheels being played and the number of winning numbers per wheel multiplies the amount wagered. For example if five wheels are played each having two winning numbers per wheel a total of ten winning numbers are chosen each game with the player betting ten times the wager on each roulette game. As a result the game is fast moving for the player and generates greater revenue for the casino as compared to traditional roulette.

In play the wheels are spun and when the winning number s is decided for each wheel the wagers are settled between the house and player. The wheels can be represented on the electronic or video screen as traditional looking roulette wheels or as any other numerical representation of the random choice of thirty eight numbers in the case of a United States wheel and thirty seven numbers in the case of a European wheel. A bonus payout may be provided when the outcome includes a number selection which is repeated a selected number of times as a winning number and winning bet.

The preferred embodiment utilizes video slot machine wheels or reels to represent at least two roulette wheels wherein each wheel has the thirty seven or thirty eight number positions of a traditional roulette wheel. In operation the wheels are spun and the winning numbers are determined by the roulette numbers that stop at the indicator or pay line position designated on the video slot machine wheel. By activating multiple pay lines multiple winning numbers can be chosen on each video roulette wheel. Another embodiment of the invention utilizes electromechanical slot machine wheels as a roulette wheel analog that would operate the same as the video slot machine wheels in the preferred embodiment.

As indicated above the roulette wheels also can be represented by graphic representations of roulette wheels having multiple numbered slots on a video or electronic screen wherein the winning number is indicated by the representation of a ball landing in the slot of the winning number. More than one winning number per roulette wheel is indicated by the representation of multiple balls falling into a number of winning number slots.

Thus this invention brings the excitement of traditional roulette to an electronic video game. Moreover excitement to the player and revenue generation to the gaming establishment are increased because the player can play multiple wheels simultaneously with a single betting choice being used for all the wheels being played. Moreover multiple winning numbers per wheel can be used. Accordingly the amount wagered is multiplied by the number of wheels that are in play as well as the number of winning numbers per wheel.

Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.

While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail one or more specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered merely an exemplification of the principles of the invention and the application is limited only to the appended claims.

Referring to the drawings in detail and initially to thereof a gaming device according to a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. While the game of the present invention can be played on any electronic computing device it is preferably played in a casino as a video gaming machine for gambling purposes. Alternatively it can be played on a computer as an on line gambling game over the Internet as part of a Wide Area Network WAN as part of a Local Area Network LAN and or on a stand alone computer.

It is also appreciated that another embodiment of the present invention involves using multiple concentric table top roulette wheels. In this embodiment a player may place a bet that covers one of the individual roulette wheels or all of the roulette wheels. It is further appreciated that multiple balls may be used on each roulette wheel thereby increasing the number of winning numbers available per roulette wheel. Thus the level of excitement is substantially increased from the standard roulette game.

The selection device may include but is not limited to a keypad a peripheral device such as an external keyboard or mouse and or a plurality of function specific buttons. In the preferred embodiment the electronic display screen is a touch screen that serves as both the selection device and the electronic screen display . In this embodiment the selection device includes interactive icons that appear on the electronic screen display . When the player touches the electronic screen display at the location where an interactive icon of the type generally known in the prior art is displayed this has the same effect as if the player were pushing a conventional electromechanical keypad button. Gaming device can also include a credit card terminal card reader or other such device for receiving payment charging the player or tracking the player s gaming activity.

In the preferred embodiment as shown in the roulette wheels are represented by a graphical representation of a series of slot machine wheels. As explained in more detail below this embodiment may also include multiple pay lines to indicate the winning numbers and to modify the odds of winning. Alternatively graphical representations of roulette wheels can be used. Likewise electromechanical slot machine reels can also be used to represent and randomly select the winning numbers. Slot machine slots can also be used to signify the winning numbers.

Referring to a simplified flow diagram illustrating an example of the steps involved in participating in a round of play is shown. Play can be initiated in step by inserting coins paper currency tokens a debit card a credit card a smart card or the like to activate device and provide the requisite payment arrangements. In a preferred embodiment the player buys a number of credits before starting to play the game. If the player does not have a sufficient number of credits the computing device prompts the player to insert more credits before allowing play to continue.

After initiating the start of the game the number of roulette wheels to be played is selected in step through the use of the wheel number selector shown in . Selecting multiple wheels serves to result in multiple winning numbers and depending on the bets that have been placed multiple winning bets. While in the examples shown and disclosed the maximum number of wheels is five it is appreciated that other embodiments may include any number of multiple wheels and not depart from the scope of the present invention. In addition to selecting the number of wheels the player may also select the number of pay lines in step through the use of the line selector shown in . Selecting more than one pay line serves to create multiple winning numbers per wheel hence multiplying the number of winning numbers and increasing the likelihood of having multiple winning bets. While the illustrated embodiment allows up to a maximum number of five pay lines it is appreciated that other embodiments may include any number of pay lines and not depart from the scope of the present invention.

Wagers are then placed in step through the use of the bet selector shown in . In order to keep the player apprised of the available credit the player s current balance may be shown in the credit display in step . Once the wagers are placed the total bet is calculated based on the number of wheels pay lines and wagers and shown in the bet display in step . In particular the total bet comprises the amount wagered multiplied by the number of active wheels multiplied by the number of pay lines selected. The increase in the number of wheels and pay lines available can create more excitement and wagering by the players. As a result potential casino revenue is increased over standard roulette play and wagering. While it is preferred that the same bet amount by applied to all wagers it is appreciated that different bet amounts may be applied to different wagers and not depart from the scope of the present invention.

The selected numbers of wheels then are spun or made to appear to spin in step by the operating system of microprocessor . A random number generator using a random function is used in step to determine which of the possible roulette wheel numbers are selected as potential winning numbers i.e. the number of wheels multiplied by the number of pay lines . The microprocessor also computes and controls the display of the possible winning numbers and determines which of the winning numbers comprise winning bets in step . Once it is determined whether any of the bets comprise winning bets the balance in the player s account is updated accordingly in step . Likewise the microprocessor and the software contained therein serve to compute and display the total bet the credits the remaining credits and all such numerical operations. Upon completion of the gaming activity the device will display a message in step inquiring whether it is desired to play another game. Otherwise the game will end in step .

Referring now to though the results of a series of different games having varying wagers numbers of wheels and pay lines are shown. As shown in the electronic screen display preferably includes a wheel portion a betting field bet input and display portion game buttons and and a total available balance display . The betting field includes the possible bets available. In the example shown in the Figures bets may be placed on one or more specific numbers 1 36 0 and or 00 particular numeric sections such as the 112 numbers the 212 numbers and or the 312 numbers additional numeric sections such as 1 to 18 and or 19 to 36 even and or odd numbers and red and or black .

Wheel portion shows five roulette wheels in play . The bet input and display portion may include various displays including but not limited to displays for the number of pay lines selected the number of wheels selected the individual wager or bet amount and the total bet 

In the embodiment shown in the screen display in the player has bet five credits as shown in display on each of five roulette wheels as shown in display . A single pay line was selected as shown in display . Accordingly the total bet as calculated by multiplying the wager five credits times the number of wheels five times the number of pay lines one as shown in display is twenty five credits.

Game buttons and may be used to allow for the game to be cleared or played. In particular clear button may be touched depressed or otherwise activated in a known way to clear among other things the results and or all existing bets. Similarly spinning of the wheels may be initiated by touching depressing or otherwise activating the spin button in a known way.

In the outcome of the spinning of five wheels with one pay line selected is shown. The potential winning numbers are those along pay line namely 5 13 27 20 and 35. Because five credits were bet on red any red number landing along the pay line after the wheels are spun would be a winning number. In the present example the payoff for a red bet is 2 for 1. As the wager was five credits each red number would therefore pay ten credits. In this case wheels and hit pay line with 5 and 27 both of which are red numbers so as to pay two times ten or twenty credits as shown in display . Because the player bet twenty five credits and received a payoff of only twenty credits the result was a net loss of five credits. Five credits are therefore subtracted from the total credits to yield 990 credits as shown in display .

After the wheel is spun and the random number generator determines the winning number of 27 which is an odd number as shown along pay line the winning bets are determined. In this example the payoff is 2 for 1 for an odd bet. As 27 is an odd number and the player had bet five credits on odd the game pays ten credits as shown in display . The net win is thus ten credits minus the five credits bet or five credits which is then added to the total balance to yield 995 credits as shown in display .

After completion of the game shown in the example shown in illustrates a game where five wheels and one pay line are selected as shown in displays and . A ten credit bet is placed on the 212 . The total bet is thus ten credits times five wheels times one pay line which equals fifty credits as shown in display . Before the game is played display informs the player to place additional bets or press spin. The player may also change the number of wheels or pay lines desired for the game. In one embodiment additional bets may be placed by pushing the bet input and display button and selecting a bet on the betting field .

By pushing the spin button the wheels are spun. Once the wheels stop spinning the winning numbers are displayed. As shown in the winning numbers along pay line are 26 27 2 9 and 1. However since none of these numbers are within the 212 i.e. to the player loses the fifty credit bet in its entirety and the display of remaining credits is updated to indicate the total balance of 1065 as shown in display .

A five wheel three pay line example is provided in . Because there are three pay lines there are three potential winning numbers per wheel. As shown in the betting field a ten credit bet is placed on 212 . Because there are five wheels and three pay lines and the total bet is five times three times ten credits or 150 credits. Because of the bet on 212 the winning numbers are those numbers between 13 and 24 that appear along one of the pay lines. In this case such winning numbers include 20 and 13 with respect to wheels and respectively and middle pay line . In addition as shown in the number 14 which is the 4number in the 4wheel is a winner with respect to the 3pay line . In this example the odds of a bet on the 212 are 3 for 1. Accordingly the total payout is three winning numbers times three times ten credits which equals 90 credits. Subtracting the amount bet 150 credits from the amount won 90 credits in this example therefore equals a net loss of 60 credits as reflected in display which has been updated to reflect 1005 total credits which is down from the prior 1065 credits of .

Referring now to the results of a game are displayed wherein five wheels and five pay lines and were selected. As shown in display and betting field a five credit bet is placed on the number 16 . The total bet is five wheels times five pay lines times five credits which equals 125 credits as shown in display . As indicated above the wheels may be cleared and spun by pressing buttons and .

The result of the spin is that the number 16 comes up as a winning number twice once along pay line on the 4wheel and once along pay line on the 1wheel . Because each individual number hit pays 36 for 1 the payout is thirty six times five credits times two hits which equals 360 credits. Accordingly the display shows that each hit of 16 pays 180 credits and that the total win is 360 credits. In the example of the payout may include a bonus because more than one of the wheels came up with the same winning number on one of the pay lines. Such bonuses can be pre selected to provide a special payout depending upon how many wheels come up with a specified number as the winning number and winning bet.

For example a bonus jackpot progressive or other special payout can be made when the outcome includes a particular number selection or one which is repeated a selected number of times on different wheels. For example a special payout could be made if a particular number of the day or match number came up or if the same number appeared a particular predetermined number of times on multiple roulette wheels. The special payout could be further constrained to be three adjacent wheels having the same number or perhaps only the first three wheels. By making it practical for a player to play virtually any number of roulette games simultaneously the invention allows the creation of these special wheel combination payouts.
