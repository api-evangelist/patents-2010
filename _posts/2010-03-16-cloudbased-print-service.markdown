An ability to print within a computing environment generally ranges from desirable to indispensable. Conventional printers and associated printing techniques typically involve installation of a print driver within the context of an operating system or platform of an associated computer. The print driver is generally specific to the associated type of printer and to the operating system and enables applications running in the context of the operating system to communicate with e.g. send print jobs to the printer.

Thus in an example user experience an owner of a computer running a particular operating system purchases a printer and then installs a version of the printer driver associated with the user s operating system onto the computer. In other example scenarios a printer i.e. associated printer driver may be installed in the context of a network. In the latter scenario s it is possible to share the installed printer among multiple network users. For example a local computer executing an application operating system and printer driver may print from the application to a remote printer using an intermediary print server. Somewhat similarly an application may execute on a remote device and the operating system and printer driver may be installed on the remote device as well. Then a user may experience or use the remotely executing application at a local computer e.g. in a remote desktop or other virtual computing environment and may print to a local or remote printer which receives commands from the remotely installed printer driver.

The above referenced paradigm for printing generally uses for each type of printer a print driver for each operating system platform from which printing may occur. Consequently it may be difficult for printer manufacturers to generate and maintain such print drivers for all available operating systems platforms and even to the extent to which printer manufacturers are successful in doing so it may be difficult for individual and or network users to be aware of identify obtain or otherwise implement an appropriate driver s or associated updates .

Further it may occur that a particular operating system platform does not support a particular print driver or any print driver at all. For example operating systems designed to run in resource limited environments such as mobile devices e.g. netbooks or smartphones may have limited or no resources to execute a print driver. As a result it may be difficult or impossible for applications running on such devices or running remotely for use on such devices to print in a satisfactory manner.

Similarly network applications e.g. web applications exist in which an application executes on a remote server while being used by a user on a local machine e.g. using a browser or other client side user interface. Such applications allow users to benefit from the use thereof without requiring local installation and associated depletion of local hardware resources . Printing documents associated with such applications is typically problematic and often requires an initial conversion of such documents into a standardized format e.g. the portable document format or .pdf before printing can proceed in a reliable or predictable fashion.

In short conventional printers and printing paradigms often provide a fragmented expensive resource intensive potentially unpredictable user experience which is sub optimal at best and unworkable at worst for many users.

According to one general aspect a print server may include instructions stored on a computer readable medium and the print server may include an application manager configured to receive a print request over a network from an application executing on a device and configured to provide over the network a print dialog to a user of the application the print dialog configured to provide for a selection of at least one printer associated with a user account of the user and thereafter receive a selected printer from the selection. The print server may include a format converter configured to receive a print job designating the selected printer the print job including print data and print characteristics expressed in a first format and configured to convert the print job from the first format into a printer specific format associated with the selected printer and a print job router configured to route the print job over the network from the print server to a print client associated with the selected printer for printing by the selected printer using the printer specific format.

According to another general aspect a computer implemented method may include receiving at a server a print request over a network from an application executing on a device determining at the server a user account associated with a user of the application providing over the network a print dialog to the user in association with the application the print dialog configured to provide for a selection of at least one printer associated with the user account receiving via the print dialog a selected printer from the selection receiving at the server a print job designating the selected printer the print job including print data and print characteristics expressed in a first format converting the print job from the first format into a printer specific format associated with the selected printer and routing the print job over the network from the server to a print client associated with the selected printer for printing by the selected printer using the printer specific format.

According to another general aspect a computer program product may include a cloud print service that is tangibly embodied on a computer readable medium and may include executable code that when executed is configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive at the cloud print service a print request over a network from an application executing on a device provide over the network a print dialog association with the application the print dialog configured to provide for a selection of at least one printer receive via the print dialog a selected printer from the selection receive at the cloud print service a print job designating the selected printer the print job including print data and print characteristics expressed in a first format convert using the cloud print service the print job from the first format into a printer specific format associated with the selected printer and route the print job over the network from the cloud print service to a print client associated with the selected printer for printing by the selected printer using the printer specific format.

According to another general aspect a cloud aware printer may include a network access manager configured to execute communications over a network between the cloud aware printer and a cloud print service being executed on a cloud print server and a print client configured to execute a print job originating from an application executing on a device that is on the network the print job being received from the cloud print service via the network access manager.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In a device is illustrated as an example of virtually any computing device from which a user may wish to execute a print job. By way of non limiting example then the device may include a laptop or desktop computer a netbook a tablet computer a smartphone a camera or any device which may store or have access to data which the user may desire to print.

In the example of an operating system is illustrated as executing an application . Again these elements are included by way of illustration and example and may include virtually any operating system or other platform on which virtually any application may run. For example the operating system may include operating systems such as the Windows operating system Mac OS or Linux and may include mobile platforms such as Android Symbian or iPhone OS to name a few examples. In other examples the operating system may include a browser based operating system such as the Chrome OS.

Consequently the application may include virtually any application which may run on any underlying operating system or platform. Examples of such applications are well known and too numerous to mention in any detail but generally include document processing applications email applications image editing or presentation software a web browser or virtually any application which provides the user with a rendering of data which the user may wish to print.

In particular as referenced above the application may represent a web application which executes on a remote application server as application . That is the application may include any application functionality which is accessed by the user over the network and experienced locally as the application e.g. using a browser running at the device . As is known such web applications allow an owner of the application server to assume responsibility for installing configuring executing and maintaining the application at the application server so that the user of the device may obtain the benefit of the application without many or any of the associated costs and responsibilities. Techniques for executing such a web application and related technology are well known in the art and are therefore not described further in detail herein except as may be helpful or necessary to understand operations of the system of .

The network may thus represent for example the public Internet or other wide area public or private network. The network may represent in further examples a corporate or other intranet and or a smaller scale local or personal network any of which may be implemented using standard network technology.

Further in a cloud aware printer is illustrated which is configured to communicate with the cloud print service over the network . In this regard the term cloud or cloud aware references the use of cloud computing which generally speaking includes a style of computing in which computing resources such as application programs and file storage are remotely provided over a network such as the Internet typically through a web browser. For example many web browsers are capable of running applications which can themselves be application programming interfaces API s to more sophisticated applications running on remote servers. In the cloud computing paradigm a web browser interfaces with and controls an application program that is running on a remote server. Through the browser the user can create edit save and delete files on the remote server via the remote application program. Thus it may be observed that the application server and associated application may also represent examples of cloud computing.

In the context of the cloud aware printer the cloud print service enables the application to print directly to the cloud aware printer without a requirement or need for e.g. independently of involvement of the operating system . In other words the application may communicate directly with the cloud print service to thereby print to the cloud aware printer without e.g. requiring a local driver within the operating system . As a result virtually any application that may be configured to communicate with the cloud print service may make use of the cloud aware printer as described in detail below.

For example the cloud print service may be configured to register the user and or the device as well as the cloud aware printer . In a specific example the device may be a smartphone and the user may use the application to purchase a ticket e.g. a movie ticket or an airline ticket . Then the user may print the purchased ticket directly to the cloud aware printer even though the device and or the operating system may not have the resources or otherwise be configured to support native printing in a conventional sense e.g. may not currently be executing a print driver of any sort associated with the cloud aware printer . In this way the user of the application may be provided with a print option and associated abilities that are not currently provided in conventional printing paradigms and techniques. Many other such examples are described herein or would be apparent.

The cloud aware printer may be contrasted with a legacy printer which does not natively support communication with the cloud print service . Therefore to illustrate additional or alternative examples of implementations of the system of a separate device is illustrated which as described below may be modified to impart the advantages of the cloud print service to the legacy printer . Similarly a router may additionally or alternatively be modified to thereby enable the legacy printer to participate in the cloud printing paradigm defined by the operations of the cloud print service as described in detail below.

In short the system provides an ability for virtually any application running on any device within the network e.g. the applications and devices to communicate with the cloud print service to thereby print to any printer which is also in direct or indirect communication with the cloud print service . Consequently users may benefit from increased printing options and abilities and experience an overall decrease in the costs and efforts associated with doing so. Meanwhile printer manufacturers may experience a decreased or eliminated need to provide users with the updated driver s and other prerequisites for users to fully experience the benefits of their products. This may result in for example higher customer satisfaction and a decreased cost of producing and maintaining printers.

In more detail the cloud print service includes a registration manager which may be configured to register printers and users. As shown then a printer manager may be configured to receive a registration of the cloud aware printer and or the legacy printer including storing identification information therefore within a data store of registered printers. Similarly a user manager may be configured to register a user s who may currently or potentially wish to execute print jobs using the cloud print service and to store identification information for such users within a data store of registered users.

There are many example scenarios and techniques by which users and or printers may come to be registered with the cloud print service through the registration manager many of which are described below in detail e.g. with respect to . In general for example a user of the device may use a browser to visit a website associated with the cloud print service and may enter a username password combination to establish a user account with the print service.

In other examples such users already may have a user account with a separate and possibly related service or service provider. For example various online services e.g. other cloud based computing resources may provide functionality such as email data storage and document processing and in such cases a user already may have a secure user account established in connection therewith. In such cases the cloud print service may leverage or access such existing user accounts e.g. to avoid a need to create a new user account and to facilitate access of existing users of other services with the cloud print service.

Consequently it may be appreciated that although the user manager and registered users data store are illustrated as being within the cloud print service it also may occur that related functionality exists externally to the cloud print service and is accessed thereby. For example the application server may provide an email application as the application and a user of the device may be registered with this email application service . In such a case the application server may have the responsibility of maintaining the user s account and the cloud print service may simply interface with the application server and provide access to the user once the user is logged into the application .

Techniques for registering users maintaining user accounts and maintaining security of users accounts are well known in the art and are not necessarily described here in detail except as may be necessary or helpful to understand operations of the system or related systems.

Meanwhile the printer manager as referenced above is responsible for registering the cloud aware printer the legacy printer and or any printer which may interface with the cloud print service and which may currently or potentially be accessed by a user of the cloud print service. As also referenced above specific techniques for and example of printer registration are provided below with respect to .

An application manager may be configured to communicate with any application which may be desired to be used for printing within the system including e.g. the application and the application . Thus for example the application manager may implement various application programming interfaces APIs which enable such communication with external applications.

Specific examples of operations of the application manager are provided below e.g. with respect to . In general though the application manager may include the functions of receiving a print request and then receiving an actual print job from e.g. the application . In general the first function of receiving a print request may include providing the user of the application directly or indirectly with a print dialog or other user interface with which the user may select an available associated registered printer. Receiving the print job may include receiving print data to be printed along with print characteristics characterizing preferences and other aspects of how the print data is desired to be printed e.g. color vs. black and white paper size orientation number of copies or any other relevant or desired print characteristic . The application manager may conduct other communications with the application as well such as e.g. providing a status of a printer or print job.

The application manager may communicate with the application or other application in a format that is independent of a specific printer e.g. that is generic with respect to all available or relevant printers within the system . In this way the application is relieved of some or all of the burdens associated with needing knowledge of a destination printer when formulating and or sending the print job.

For example with reference to the print job just described the application may formulate both the print data and print characteristics in the same manner regardless of whether the print job is destined for e.g. the cloud aware printer or the legacy printer . In fact even if the user of the application does not currently have any registered printer associated with his or her user account the print job still may be forwarded to the cloud print service for storage and later printed to whatever printer is ultimately registered with the cloud print service and the user s account.

Consequently the application may include or use or be associated with APIs to communicate with the application manager where such APIs may be light weight consistent customizable and easy to implement within or among various applications. Moreover such APIs may rarely if ever need to be updated or maintained by the user in order for the user print from the application using the cloud print service . Instead such updates may be managed by an administrator or other provider of the cloud print service and or by a provider of the application so that the user of the application is unburdened of associated efforts and responsibilities. Even as new printers are introduced into the marketplace over time the user may have the experience that the application is able to utilize the new printer s simply by way of registration of the new printers with the cloud print service as described in detail below.

Print jobs received at the application manager in the printer independent or generic format may be passed to a format converter which may be configured to receive a print job from the application manager and facilitate or execute conversion of the print job into a format associated with the designated type of printer for the print job in question. Such conversion may thus generally include as needed conversion of the print data itself as well as conversion of the print characteristics specified within a given print job.

For example printers generally require low level device or type specific instructions which provide a basis by which printers actually apply ink to paper to achieve a desired appearance. Such instructions therefore may include very specific portrayal of the desired print outcome using e.g. a Page Description Language PDL . For example the language PostScript may be used to describe a desired print outcome and then rendered e.g. rasterized by a specific printer to generate printed text or images. Additionally fixed layout document formats exist which are designed to facilitate device independent printing while maintaining document fidelity. For example the portable document format .pdf is an example of such a format where .pdf documents may be generated using PostScript. Somewhat similarly the XML Paper Specification XPS provides such a fixed layout document format which is based on the eXtensible Markup Language XML .

Print data may be received from the application in virtually any format including e.g. Hypertext Markup Language HTML or in a format associated with document processing and or images e.g. .jpeg or in the PDF or XPS formats referenced above. The format converter may thus be configured to receive print data in these and other various formats and convert the print data into a format that is recognizable by a designated printer.

Similarly the format converter may be configured to convert the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer. That is as referenced above the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed i.e. based on preferences of the user and or on capabilities or lack thereof of the designated printer s . For example the legacy printer may be a black and white printer with no two sided printing abilities while the cloud aware printer may be a color printer with two sided printing. The format converter may then provide conversion accordingly depending on a selected printer.

The format converter may provide and execute the resulting converted print job using e.g. a protocol referred to herein as a cloud print protocol CPP . Thus the cloud print protocol allows the cloud print service to communicate with the cloud aware printer or the legacy printer . Further detail and other aspects of the cloud print protocol are described in more detail below.

The converted print job may be stored in a data store illustrated as job store in . Although illustrated separately in for the sake of clarity and description it may be appreciated that the job store may overlap or coincide with the data stores of the registration manager . That is for example print jobs of a given user may be stored in conjunction with the user account of the user and in conjunction with one or more printers registered to that user. As a result print jobs may be committed to long term storage so that for example users may locate identify and re print desired print jobs even if the user later accesses the cloud print service from a different device than was used to originally send a given print job.

Thus it may be observed that conversion of the print job at least partially occurs at a separate device s e.g. the cloud print server the cloud aware printer the device or the router from the device s on which the originating application is executing e.g. the device the application server or the device . In this way for example it is possible to formulate and submit a print job at least partially separately from a conversion of the print job into a printer specific format and to thereby divorce such conversion from an underlying operating system of the executing application.

A print job router may be configured to route the converted print job to a designated printer and otherwise monitor and mediate execution and success failure of the print job. The print job router may thus be responsible for managing and monitoring on going print jobs from a plurality of users which are designated for a corresponding plurality of printers as described in detail below.

In so doing the print job router may be configured to execute e.g. with a print client executing on firmware of the cloud aware printer . The print client may communicate with the cloud print service e.g. with the print job router and or the registration manager using the cloud print protocol referenced above.

More specifically the print client may be configured to register the cloud aware printer with the cloud print service and to thereby associate the thus registered printer with a user of the device . Moreover the print client may be configured to actually drive the cloud aware printer and thereby execute the desired printing.

In the example of the cloud aware printer is illustrated as including the print client within the firmware . The firmware as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art may represent factory installed hardware and or software which provides designated functions without generally requiring or allowing user modification or configuration e.g. may utilize read only memory . Thus the cloud aware printer may be pre configured from before a time of purchase to communicate and coordinate with the cloud print service to thereby provide a convenient and enjoyable user experience.

For example the cloud aware printer may include a network access manager user input and a display or other user output which may generally represent conventional components that are not described here in detail except as needed to assist in understanding the operation of the system . Of course the cloud aware printer also may include other conventional components which are not discussed here for the sake or clarity and conciseness.

The network access manager may represent associated hardware and or software which enables the cloud aware printer to communicate over the network with the cloud print service . For example such communication may be conducted wirelessly if the cloud aware printer is within range of an appropriate wireless network. In other examples the network access manager may enable a wired connection of the cloud aware printer to the network e.g. by way of connection to a router such as the router .

The user input may represent virtually any sort of keypad stylus or other techniques for entering data to the cloud aware printer . Similarly the display may represent virtually any sort of audio and or video display to output information to a user of the cloud aware printer .

In example scenarios then a user may purchase the cloud aware printer . Upon powering the cloud aware printer may automatically output or identify the cloud print service e.g. by printing a URL or other identifier on paper loaded in a paper tray of the cloud aware printer or by displaying such information using the display . Similarly the cloud aware printer may output registration information for itself e.g. a serial number or other unique identifier.

Then in one example scenario the purchaser may use the device or other network device to communicate with the cloud print service e.g. by using a browser to visit a website of the cloud print service provided by the cloud print server . The user purchaser may then log into his or her user account associated with the cloud print service and be prompted to enter the registration information for the cloud aware printer .

In other example implementations the user input and display may similarly be used to communicate directly with the cloud print service using the network access manager . For example upon powering the cloud aware printer may automatically connect to the cloud print service using the print client and the network access manager and then use the display to prompt the user purchaser to login to the cloud print service to thereby automatically associate the cloud aware printer as being registered to the user purchaser.

In contrast the legacy printer may not be manufactured to include the print client and or other components of the cloud aware printer . For example the legacy printer may have been manufactured prior to an availability of the cloud print service or simply may have been made without the necessary components to communicate with the cloud print service .

In such a case the legacy printer may be connected in a conventional way to the device e.g. by USB or other suitable wired or wireless connection . For example the device may include an operating system which may be used to host a print client which is conceptually similar to the print client and which serves as a proxy for the legacy printer to thereby allow the legacy printer to participate in the system .

In some implementations the print client proxy may communicate directly with the legacy printer to execute a print job from the cloud print service . In other implementations the operating system may have a conventional printer driver installed for the legacy printer in which case the system may leverage some or all of the functionality of the print driver to drive the legacy printer .

Thus in operation the print client proxy may be configured to register the legacy printer with the registration manager printer manager of the cloud print service in a similar manner s as described above and depending on a presence or absence of capabilities of the legacy printer e.g. whether the legacy printer includes network access user input and or display components .

Once registered an application which may desire to print to the legacy printer may communicate a print job to the cloud print service e.g. in the manner described above with respect to the application . As the legacy printer is thus incorporated and integrated into the system it may be appreciated that the application and or the application may thus print to the legacy printer as easily as to the cloud aware printer . For example a user of the device may use the application to execute a print job to the legacy printer even if the legacy printer is remote from the device over the network at the time of the printing.

Similarly a print client may be installed as a proxy component on the router as an addition or alternative to the print client to integrate the legacy printer into the system . The print client proxy may thus similarly allow for registration of the legacy printer with the cloud print service and with one or more users e.g. of the device and or the device and may accept print jobs from the cloud print service which are designated for the legacy printer .

Many features and advantages are provided by the system and variations thereof as referenced herein and or as would be apparent to one of skill in the art. For example as described the system facilitates remote printing in a straight forward and easily implementable fashion because a user need only log in to the cloud print service and register a printer using any device e.g. personal computer smartphone or other mobile device or a printer itself . Then the user can thereafter login to the cloud print service from any device anywhere on the network and send a print job to the thus registered printer from any compatible application even if the device and printer are remote from one another.

In other example implementations it is possible to share printers between different users. For example techniques currently exist for sharing documents in existing cloud based document processing management systems such as when a first user sends an email to a second user with a link to a document to be shared. With the system such techniques and concepts can be extended to the realm of printing. For example the first user may send a link referencing a printer to be shared e.g. referencing or including registration information for the printer so that the second receiving user may simply follow the link to associate the identified printer with the second user s cloud print service user account. In these and other scenarios users may e.g. print documents directly to a receiving user or print work documents to a home printer or vice versa and otherwise experience the benefits of remote printing.

In the example of a print request may be received at a server over a network and from an application executing on a device . For example as described above the application manager may receive a print request from a user of the application executing on the device or of the application executing on the application server or of the application of the device . The print request may be received over the network using an API that is common to the application and the application manager .

A user account associated with a user of the application may be determined at the server . For example the application manager may conduct authentication of the user of the application in question e.g. in conjunction with the registration manager . The authentication may occur prior to the print request or in response thereto.

A print dialog may be provided over the network to the user in association with the application the print dialog configured to provide for a selection of at least one printer associated with the user account . For example the application manager may determine that both of the printers are registered and associated with the user account of the user in question. Then the application manager may render the print dialog in conjunction with the application and including a selection between the two printers .

A selected printer from the selection may be received via the print dialog . For example the application manager may receive a selection of either the cloud aware printer or the legacy printer .

A print job designating the selected printer may be received at the server the print job including print data and print characteristics expressed in a first format . For example the application manager may receive the print job designating either of the printers . The print job as described may include both the actual print data to be printed as well as print characteristics specifying a manner in which the print data is to be printed relative to printer capabilities of the selected printer s . For example such print characteristics may include a designation of one sided versus two sided printing paper size paper tray color versus black and white and various other such well known print characteristics.

The print job including the print data and such print characteristics may be expressed in the first format as a printer independent format. That is the print job may be communicated to the application manager by way of an appropriate API and in a manner which is generic or agnostic with respect to the selected printer or to any printer. Consequently the application in question need not have any knowledge of the printer to be used even after the printer has been selected in order to transmit the print job.

The print job may be converted from the first format into a printer specific format associated with the selected printer . For example the format converter may be configured to convert the first e.g. printer independent format into a printer specific format for a selected one of the printers . As may be appreciated and as described herein the term printer specific in this context may include e.g. reference to a specific type category or brand of printer or to a uniquely identified printer. The print job in the printer specific format may include a full rasterization of the print job for use in printing by the selected printer e.g. when the selected printer includes the cloud aware printer or may include a partial conversion so that final rasterization may occur later e.g. at the print client proxy and or the print driver of the device as described herein .

The print job may be routed over the network from the server to a print client associated with the selected printer for printing by the selected printer using the printer specific format . For example the print job router may be configured to route the print job to the print client of the cloud aware printer or to the print client s of the legacy printer .

In a user may be registered with the cloud print service . For example as referenced above a user wishing to use the cloud print service may visit a web site thereof and establish a user account e.g. by providing a username password combination. In other scenarios the user may visit the cloud print service website or a related website e.g. an online email provider and associate an existing user account of the related website with the cloud print service . The user account information may then be established and stored by or accessed by the user manager and or the registered users data store .

In a single cloud print service is illustrated. However it may be appreciated that the network may be used by multiple providers to provide multiple cloud print services. For example a printer manufacturer may provide a cloud print service for its printers while a 3party provider for more general cloud computing may provide the cloud print service as an auxiliary feature for its existing cloud based computing platform and therefore as a general service which is not specific to any particular type of printer.

Once a user account is established or available a new printer may be determined such as when a new printer is purchased and powered on or when a given user gains access to a previously inaccessible printer. For example if the new printer is cloud aware the registration of the cloud aware printer with the cloud print service may proceed directly such as described above . For example as described the user may login to the cloud print service through an associated website or using the cloud aware printer itself and registration information identifying the cloud aware printer may be entered by the user or received automatically by the cloud print service over the network .

If the new printer is not cloud aware e.g. is a legacy printer such as the legacy printer then it may be determined whether a print client is available on a device associated with the legacy printer . If not then it may be necessary to install such a print client proxy on an associated device such as on the device and or associated router as shown in . For example the user may execute such an installation by visiting the website of the cloud print service and following a link to download an appropriate print client .

If the legacy printer requires an associated conventional print driver in addition to the print client e.g. from a manufacturer of the legacy printer then such software also may be downloaded or otherwise installed an the appropriate device e.g. on the device or the router .

Then e.g. using the print client the legacy printer may be registered with the cloud print service . As with the cloud aware printer such registration may include providing of a unique identifier for the legacy printer as well as other information which may be required by or useful to the cloud print service . For example such registration information may include printer capabilities of the legacy printer such as whether and how the legacy printer provides color printing two sided printing or other print features and further details of the legacy printer such as a number and location of paper trays detailed information on how to report paper jams or other exceptions or malfunctions and other information characterizing the legacy printer .

Again such registration information may also be required by or useful for the cloud print service with respect to the cloud aware printer . However in the case of the cloud aware printer it may occur that such registration information is provided automatically by the cloud aware printer or at least partially provided at an earlier stage such as at a time of manufacture of the cloud aware printer . In the latter case for example it may occur that a printer manufacturer provides the cloud print service for all of its printers. In such a case the printer manufacturer may know or may determine any needed registration information e.g. printer capabilities when initially manufacturing each printer for sale. Then during an actual registration of a specific cloud aware printer it may only be necessary to transmit a minimal amount of information to identify the specific printer uniquely for association with one or more users.

In the above examples it is assumed that the printer s to be registered are being registered with the account s of logged in users who wish to access a new printer. As a further technique for registering printers and as referenced above it may occur that already registered printers of a first user may be associated shared with an already registered second user.

For example a share request may be received from a user identifying a registered printer to be shared and identifying one or more users to receive the share request. The share request may be provided e.g. by email to the identified user s . Then the registered printer s may be designated as shared with the designated users . That is a receiving second user may thereafter have some or all printing rights with respect to the shared printer.

In the example flowchart of it is assumed that all relevant users and printers are registered with the cloud print service and that a user e.g. a user of the device and or may wish to print to either the cloud aware printer or the legacy printer .

Initially then the cloud print service e.g. the print job router may be configured to periodically check a status of a printer s using a corresponding print client . For example the print job router may be aware that the cloud aware printer is available as long as the cloud aware printer is powered on at a given time. On the other hand checking a status of the legacy printer may require that the router and or the device is are both powered e.g. so that corresponding print client s is are available . In the present context printer status may include a determination as to whether a given printer is available or is currently experiencing an exception e.g. paper jam and or a determination as to a current number of print jobs queued for the printer in question.

At some point in time a print request may be received from an application . For example a user of the device may be using the application e.g. by reading an email or other document or by viewing an image within an image viewing application. Within the application the user may select a print option e.g. by using a generally conventional technique s such as selecting from within a drop down menu or selecting a printer icon displayed within the application. Such action may initiate or execute a communication between the application and the application manager so as to notify the application manager that a print job may be forthcoming.

It may be necessary to authorize the user as being allowed to proceed with printing. For example the need may exist to ensure that the user in question has a user account established with the cloud print service .

User authorization techniques are generally well known and not discussed here in detail. In general though the application manager may communicate with the user manager to verify that the user has provided a valid username password or otherwise been authenticated. If the user does not have a valid user account then a user account may be established. Of course it may occur that user authorization occurs prior to receipt of a print request as well.

For the authorized user the application manager may then communicate with the printer manager to determine which registered printers from the registered printers are associated with the user s account including any printers shared with the user by another user . For example the application manager may determine that the user is associated with both the cloud aware printer and with the legacy printer . Based on the status checks referenced above by the print job router it may be assumed that both printers have been determined to be available for printing.

As referenced herein the user may be remote from the printers e.g. may be using a mobile device as the device and may be walking riding within a car or otherwise in an environment not currently considered optimal or feasible for printing. Further the user may be using the application which may similarly represent an application not currently associated with optimal or feasible printing options e.g. web applications as referenced above .

Nonetheless simply by selecting print and signing into the cloud print service such a user may be presented with full printing options for all registered and available printers. For example the cloud aware printer may represent a work printer while the legacy printer is a home printer of the user. In another example and continuing the example above in which the device represents a mobile device e.g. a smartphone it may occur that the user is talking to another user who owns the cloud aware printer . The device user may use online capabilities of the device to select and purchase tickets e.g. tickets to a show or airline tickets. Then the device user may select the cloud aware printer of the other user to print the tickets so that the two users may both meet later at a rendezvous point and may both have hard copies of the needed tickets.

Continuing the example operations of in more detail once the printers are determined as being associated with the user of the device the application manager may present the user with a print dialog including a list of the available printers and or current information about capabilities or a status of each printer .

As referenced above and as described in more detail below with respect to the application manager may provide such a print dialog either directly or indirectly. That is in either case the application manager may access a suitable API to interact with the application . In a first example a suitable API may be used to actually render a print dialog within the application where a presentation and other aspects of an appearance of such a print dialog may be determined exclusively by the application manager . In such cases such print dialogs are thus provided by the cloud print service and may therefore be consistent in appearance and content within and among various applications. For example the cloud print service may be included within or operate in conjunction with a suite of applications e.g. email applications image viewing applications and any other cloud based web applications . Consequently there may be value to a provider of such a suite of application to have the cloud print service provide a uniform print dialog across multiple applications. Further it may be easiest and most straight forward for a developer of the application to integrate and utilize the API s of the application manager by using a provided print dialog.

In other example implementations however an application developer may specifically wish to develop a specific print dialog to be associated with the application which may be different from a default print dialog provided by the application manager . For example such a choice may be a matter of preference as to an appearance or functionality of the print dialog. In other examples and conversely to the examples above it may occur that the application is itself part of a suite of applications and further that each application within such a suite may be compatible with multiple cloud print services. In such a case the application developer may wish to provide a uniform print dialog across all of the application suite and cloud print services. Consequently the application manager may use a suitable API or aspects thereof to provide the application with information necessary to render a print dialog and the application itself may be responsible for an actual desired rendering.

However the print dialog is provided it may subsequently occur that the user selects from the provided printer list e.g. from the printers and then is provided with printer options associated with a selected printer. Upon selecting from these options the user may then submit and the application manager may then receive the print job from the selected printer including the actual print data and the selected print characteristics. As referenced and described herein the print job may be communicated to the application manager using a corresponding API and in a format that is independent of the selected printer e.g. in a format that would be the same for the same print job for either printer regardless of which printer was actually selected . In this way the application need not have any awareness or knowledge of the selected printer other than allowing for the actual selection thereof by the user from within the print dialog.

At the cloud print service the received print job may then be converted into a printer format for the selected printer . For example the format converter may be configured to convert the printer independent format into a format associated with the cloud aware printer or the legacy printer depending on a selection of the user.

The print job may then be stored in association with the user account of the user e.g. within the job storage . The print job may be stored in either the printer independent format as received from the application or in the printer format associated with the selected printer. In either case as referenced above such persistent storage of the print job in association with the user account allows for later location and printing of the same print job at a later date without having to re generate the document to be printed e.g. without having to visit a website at which a document was originally generated .

The print job may then be output to a corresponding print client . For example the print job router may output the converted print job to either of the printers or both depending on which was selected earlier. If the selected printer does not include a cloud aware printer e.g. includes a legacy printer then the print job may be received at the local print client and communicated to the local print driver e.g. may be received at the print client s and communicated to the print driver .

It may be appreciated that the burden of converting the print job from the printer independent format received from the application for actual printing at one of the printers may be shared to varying extents between the format converter and the various print clients . For example in one example using the cloud aware printer the format converter may provide essentially the entire process of determining printer commands for the cloud aware printer . In this case the print client may be used to receive the print job for forwarding to appropriate printer hardware e.g. processor s driving the associated ink dispensers . In such a case the cloud aware printer may be very inexpensive to manufacture with minimal hardware software requirements.

In other scenarios the format converter may execute a partial format conversion and the print clients may be more involved in calculating or otherwise determining actual low level printer commands. Such a practice may be suitable for example where a manufacturer of the printer in question has certain specific needs or requirements which are not readily compatible with the cloud print service or in other cases where the printer in question already has the processing capabilities to be responsible for a certain amount of the conversion process. In the latter case although such printers may be relatively more expensive due to supporting the associated hardware and software requirements associated with the conversion s it may make sense simply to leverage such existing resources if they do already exist rather than support them independently at the cloud print service . In particular the legacy printer may already have a relatively large amount of hardware software resources including the print driver so that it may make sense to perform a relatively small proportion of the format conversion process at the format converter while allowing the print client and the print driver to finalize and execute a final print job.

In either case the print job may proceed with execution during which the print job router having provided the print job may continue to maintain the print job status for provision to the application as needed . For example after execution of the print job begins a paper jam may occur at the legacy printer . Then the print job router may become aware of the paper jam through the print client and may thereafter output a notification to the application perhaps using the print dialog of the application manager .

Assuming any such exceptions may be resolved the print job may be completed . At a later time as referenced above a request may be received for a previous stored print job . For example a user of the application may select print and the resulting print dialog may include an option to select previous print jobs whereupon such previous print jobs may be retrieved from the job storage . For example the user may be provided the options of identifying previous print jobs by search terms dates of printing or other selection criteria. Then the user may execute a selected previous print job and moreover may execute such a print job using any registered printer associated with the user .

In the example of the cloud print service is illustrated as including a print dialog API which is in communication with a tickler . The tickler may be operable to send notification s of new print jobs available for a given printer s .

Then upon authorization of a user by the print dialog API a list of printers associated printer capabilities and current jobs per printer and other status information may be provided to the application user e.g. by way of a common print dialog which may be rendered e.g. using Javascript. As already explained such a print dialog may in appearance resemble conventional print dialogs except as otherwise set forth herein e.g. may allow for selection of an available printer and associated print features . In an example of a non conventional aspect of the common print dialog the common print dialog may include a field s to allow a user to search and identify a previous stored print job that is persistently stored by the cloud print service .

The print dialog API may thus provide e.g. render the common print dialog essentially in its entirety for the application user and thereby provide a common print dialog experience across applications interfacing with the cloud print service . As also described the print dialog API also may simply provide sufficient information for an application developer to construct a third party dialog which may be different in appearance than the common print dialog e.g. may have a proprietary appearance associated with a suite of applications provided by the developer provider thereof.

Assuming authorization of the user proceeds the user may then provide printer selection s and associated desired print characteristics as well as the actual print data. The print data may be expressed in any conventional format e.g. HTML PDF XPS or an image format such as JPG to name a few.

The print job may then be received at a job submit API e.g. from either dialog . In some implementations the print data may be included by reference to remote print data e.g. by identification of an appropriate URL. Then an application data fetcher may be used to retrieve data to be printed.

The job submit API may receive the print job in to give a specific and non limiting example s a hyper text transfer protocol HTTP multi part request which may include the printer capabilities expressed e.g. in XPS as well as a MIME type identifying the content type. The job submit API may then provide the print job including the print data and print characteristics to a format converter . The format converter operates essentially as described herein with respect to the format converter of and stores the print job within storage .

A print client which may represent any of the print clients of communicates with a job control API and a job fetch API to execute the print job. Specifically the job fetch API may provide the print job to the print client e.g. may be used by the print client to fetch the next available job for the specified printer.

The job control API may be responsible for authorizing the print client as needed and for receiving updated status information from the printer in question such as whether the print job has completed or failed. Such status information may also be stored within the storage in associated with a corresponding print job. The job control API may include status information including e.g. whether a print job is currently queued and not yet downloaded to a corresponding print client or spooled downloaded and added to the client side native printer queue if applicable .

In further examples of the print client as the print client proxy it may occur that the proxy fetches print jobs in PDF format along with the user selected print characteristics represented as XML. Then the proxy may use a PDF interpreted library to rasterize and print the PDF.

Finally in a user printer register API is illustrated which is responsible for communicating with the print client to register the user s and all associated printers. Such registration information may be communicated using a HTTP multi part request and may include identification of the printer along with the printer capabilities e.g. expressed in XPS and may be stored in the storage with the various print jobs. Further as referenced above with respect to such registration processes and information may occur previously to actual print job executions or interspersed therewith. In the latter case for example the user may seek to execute a print job only to find that all available printers are currently occupied jammed or offline. Nonetheless it would be a simple matter for the user then to register a new printer with the cloud print service and proceed accordingly with the newly registered printer to execute the desired print job.

Many other examples and variations of the systems and operations of would be apparent to one skilled in the art. For example instead of printing to a hardware printer the system s or similar systems may be used to print to PDF or other software format.
