title: Managing integration of external nodes into provided computer networks
abstract: Techniques are described for managing communications for a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a distinct substrate computer network, including for communications between computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network connected to the substrate network and other network nodes external to the substrate network. The managed virtual computer network may have multiple associated virtual network addresses, with each of the computing nodes being associated with at least one of the virtual network addresses, and with one or more external network nodes being integrated into the managed virtual computer network based at least in part by associating one or more other of the virtual network addresses with the external network nodes. The managing of the communications may further include using one or more translation manager modules that interconnect the substrate network with one or more external networks or other external connections via which the external network nodes are accessible.

Many companies and other organizations operate computer networks that interconnect numerous computing systems to support their operations with the computing systems alternatively co located e.g. as part of a private local area network or LAN or instead located in multiple distinct geographical locations e.g. connected via one or more other private or shared intermediate networks . For example data centers housing significant numbers of interconnected co located computing systems have become commonplace such as private data centers that are operated by and on behalf of a single organization as well as public data centers that are operated by entities as businesses. Some public data center operators provide network access power and secure installation facilities for hardware owned by various customers while other public data center operators provide full service facilities that also include hardware resources made available for use by their customers. However as the scale and scope of typical data centers and computer networks has increased the task of provisioning administering and managing the associated physical computing resources has become increasingly complicated.

The advent of virtualization technologies for commodity hardware has provided some benefits with respect to managing large scale computing resources for many customers with diverse needs allowing various computing resources to be efficiently and securely shared between multiple customers. For example virtualization technologies such as those provided by VMWare XEN Linux s KVM Kernel based Virtual Machine or User Mode Linux may allow a single physical computing machine to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with one or more virtual machines hosted by the single physical computing machine with each such virtual machine being a software simulation acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource while also providing application isolation and security among the various virtual machines.

Techniques are described for providing managed computer networks such as for managed computer networks that are each implemented as a virtual computer network overlaid on one or more other computer networks. The managed computer networks may in some embodiments be provided by a configurable network service to users or other entities who are customers e.g. for a fee or otherwise clients of the configurable network service such as to remote clients that access the configurable network service and or the provided managed computer networks from remote locations over one or more intervening networks e.g. over the Internet . In at least some embodiments the techniques include managing communications for various computing nodes of a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network including in situations in which one or more network nodes that are external to the substrate network are integrated into and used as part of the managed virtual computer network. As one example the computing nodes of a managed computer network may be co located at a particular data center and a configurable network service that is providing the managed computer network for a client may use one or more edge devices at the data center in order to manage communications between a substrate network at the data center and other external network nodes that are not connected to the substrate network such as external network nodes that are located in one or more separate geographical locations e.g. at remote premises of the client or that are part of a co location facility for the data center. In at least some embodiments some or all of the described techniques are automatically performed by embodiments of a system manager module one or more communication manager modules and or one or more translation manager modules such as modules that are part of a network accessible configurable network service.

Thus the managing of communications for a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network may in at least some embodiments include managing communications between one or more computing nodes of the managed computer network that are connected to the substrate network and one or more network nodes external to the substrate network. For example the computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network may in some embodiments each have an associated communication manager module that manages communications to and or from the computing node and the communication manager module associated with a source computing node that is sending a communication to one or more indicated final destinations may in at least some situations facilitate the sending of that communication. Similarly any external network nodes integrated into the managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network may in some embodiments each have an associated translation manager module that manages communications to and or from the external network node such as by managing communications that pass between the substrate network and one or more external networks or other external connections. Furthermore the managed virtual computer network may have multiple associated virtual network addresses e.g. a range of contiguous virtual network addresses such as a CIDR Classless Inter Domain Routing block with each of the computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network being associated with at least one of the virtual network addresses for the managed virtual computer network and with one or more external network nodes being integrated into the managed virtual computer network based at least in part by associating one or more other of the virtual network addresses for the managed virtual computer network with the external network nodes and by managing use of the various virtual network addresses accordingly. For example in some embodiments and situations a group of multiple of the virtual network addresses associated with a managed virtual computer network e.g. a sub range or other subset of a range of contiguous virtual network addresses for the managed virtual computer network may be associated with a group of multiple external nodes that are co located at an external location outside of the substrate network as discussed in greater detail below.

When a source computing node of the managed virtual computer network initiates an outgoing communication to a destination external network node that is integrated into the managed virtual computer network e.g. by sending the communication to a destination virtual network address that is associated with the destination external network node the communication manager module associated with the source computing node may identify a particular translation manager module that is associated with the external network node encode the communication in a manner specific to the substrate network e.g. by including various information in the encoded communication to enable the communication to be properly forwarded over the substrate network such as in a header of the communication and then forward the encoded communication over the substrate network to the identified associated translation manager module for the destination external network node. When the associated translation manager module receives the communication the translation manager module decodes the communication so that it is no longer specific to the substrate network e.g. by removing any information previously included in the encoded communication to enable the communication to be properly forwarded over the substrate network modifies the decoded communication so that it is directed to an external location associated with the external network node and to optionally add network identifying information for the managed virtual computer network to the modified communication and forwards the modified communication to the external network node over one or more external networks or other external connections. When multiple virtual network addresses are associated with an external location outside of the substrate network e.g. with one or more external network nodes at that external location one or more translation manager modules connected to the substrate network may similarly be configured to forward any communications from the substrate network that are directed to any of those multiple virtual network addresses to that external location including in situations in which the translation manager module is not aware of the particular external network node that will ultimately receive the communication e.g. if a device at the external location is responsible for receiving and further handling communications sent to those multiple virtual network addresses and optionally in which no actual external network node is currently associated with a particular one or more of the multiple virtual network addresses e.g. such that a device at the external location will cache the communication until a corresponding external network node is available or may instead drop the communication or otherwise handle the communication in other manners . In addition as described in greater detail below the external connection via which a translation manager module forwards a communication to an external network node may have various forms in various embodiments and situations and the translation manager module may further encode or otherwise format communications in a manner specific to a particular type of external connection that will be used in various manners as non exclusive examples the types of external connections may include the following a link that is configured to support VLAN virtual LAN identifiers such as in accordance with the IEEE 802.1Q standard e.g. with the translation manager module optionally adding an appropriate VLAN identifier corresponding to a particular managed virtual computer network to a communication being sent over that external connection a link that is configured to support MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching labels or tags e.g. with the translation manager module optionally adding an appropriate MPLS label corresponding to a particular managed virtual computer network to a communication being sent over that external connection one or more external networks that use publicly routable external network addresses e.g. with the translation manager module optionally tracking a publicly routable external network address for one or more particular external network nodes and forwarding communications to those external network nodes to that external network address a link that is connected to a VPN Virtual Private Network connection endpoint e.g. with the translation manager module optionally adding an external network address or other information that the VPN connection endpoint will use in further encoding the communication before it is forwarded to the external network node etc. Communications being sent from an external network node to a computing node of a managed virtual computer network may be handled in a similar manner but in the opposite direction as discussed in greater detail below. In some embodiments the source computing node may be one of multiple virtual machines hosted on a physical computer system the associated communication manager module for the source computing node may be provided by a virtual machine hypervisor monitor executing on the physical computing system to manage those hosted virtual machines and the translation manager module may be provided as part of an edge device or other module that interconnects the substrate network and one or more external networks via which the external network node is accessible.

In addition the translation manager modules may further optionally provide various additional types of functionality in various embodiments for at least some communications that they manage. Such optional additional functionality may include for example one or more of the following firewall functionality network address translation NAT functionality port address translation PAT functionality intrusion detection functionality intrusion prevention functionality content analysis functionality virtual private network VPN connection endpoint functionality or other functionality involving modifying the format or encoding of a communication e.g. to encapsulate a communication in another communication to separate a single communication into multiple communications or to combine multiple communications into a single communication etc. wide area network WAN acceleration or other network acceleration etc. Similar functionality may also be provided in at least some embodiments by external network nodes that operate as intermediate destinations for some or all communications such as to manage communications passing between two or more groups of computing nodes of a managed computer network. One or more translation manager modules and or other modules e.g. the system manager module may also perform various other management tasks related to the tracking and managing of operations in at least some embodiments. For example the translation manager modules or other modules may perform metering of a quantity of communications handled by the translation manager modules that are destined for and or forwarded to external nodes may perform filtering of particular communications to prevent unauthorized communications from being further forwarded by the translation manager modules e.g. for communications received from external network nodes that are intended for a computing node accessible via the substrate network etc. In some embodiments and situations the forwarding or other handling of a communication by a translation manager module and or an intermediate destination external network node may also include otherwise modifying the communication before it is further forwarded or blocking the communication from being further forwarded e.g. as part of filtering particular communications that are not authorized as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. In addition the external network nodes may have various forms and provide various types of functionality in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments and situations a particular external network node may be integrated into a managed virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network in order to provide one or more specified types of functionality that are not available from any other computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network and or that are not available from any modules or devices that are accessible via the substrate network e.g. any modules or devices available from by a configurable network service that provides the managed virtual computer network to a client as non exclusive examples the external network node may be developed internally by a client for whom the managed virtual computer network is provided e.g. a legacy system of the client may be a specialized hardware device and or software from a third party vendor that is not available via the substrate network etc. Such external network nodes may in some embodiments and situations be particular specialized hardware devices and or may be general purpose computing devices that are configured via software to perform particular functionality. In addition in some embodiments and situations a particular external network node may be a final destination for a communication directed to the external network node e.g. may receive and store information in the communication without responding may optionally initiate subsequent response communications to the sender etc. while in other embodiments and situations a particular external network node may be an intermediate destination for a communication that is sent by a computing node of a managed virtual computer network such as to perform one or more specified types of processing on the communication before optionally forwarding the communication to another computing node of that same managed virtual computer network or instead to another final destination. Additional details related to various techniques for managing communications between computing nodes of a managed virtual computer network and external network nodes integrated into the managed virtual computer network are included below.

Furthermore in at least some embodiments and situations the substrate network may have multiple translation manager modules that may alternatively be used to manage communications between the computing nodes of a managed virtual computer network and one or more external network nodes integrated into the managed virtual computer network. The selection of a particular one of multiple alternative translation manager modules for use with a communication may be performed in various manners in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments each of the multiple alternative translation manager modules may be assigned a distinct substrate network address such as from a CIDR block of contiguous network addresses or instead from another group of multiple network addresses. If so a particular one of the multiple alternative translation manager modules may in some embodiments be selected based on its associated network address such as by first selecting one of the multiple network addresses associated with the multiple alternative translation manager modules and then using the particular translation manager module associated with the selected network address. As one example a hashing function may be used in some embodiments to deterministically select a particular translation manager module using particular information from a communication to be sent e.g. by a communication manager module that manages a sending computing node who sends the communication and or by a system manager module such as based at least in part on a destination network address and or source network address in the communication or instead on any other one or more other attributes of the communication e.g. one or more types of information associated with sending of the communication such as a networking protocol used to encode the communication a TCP Transmission Control Protocol port number or other port identifier etc. one or more types of information stored in one or more header fields of the communication such as a protocol identifier a port number an indication of content type etc. one or more other attributes of the communication such as a size etc. . It will be appreciated that various hashing functions may be used in various embodiments and that a particular translation manager module may be selected in manners other than via a hashing function e.g. randomly based at least in part on factors associated with the alternative translation manager modules such as load etc. . In addition if the hashing function or other selection of a particular translation manager module is deterministically based on a combination of a communication s destination network address and source network address then subsequent communications from that same source network address to that same destination network address may in some embodiments be directed to the same particular translation manager module e.g. by dynamically selecting the same translation manager module for each of the communications based on each of the communications having the same associated information that is used for the dynamic selecting thus providing advantages related to communication flow continuity in at least some situations.

Alternatively in other embodiments after a particular translation manager module is selected for a particular communication from a source computing node to a final destination the described techniques may include performing additional operations to ensure that at least some subsequent communications from that same source computing node to that same final destination are directed to the same particular translation manager module such as by tracking particular translation manager modules used for particular source final destination pairs e.g. to maintain use of a particular translation manager module for subsequent communications that occur during a particular communication session or that otherwise satisfy one or more indicated criteria such as being sent during a specified period of time . In addition in some embodiments the substrate network may optionally include one or more networking devices or other components e.g. a networking router device a load balancer etc. that are associated with the multiple alternative translation manager modules and that operate to direct certain communications to particular translation manager modules. For example a router device may be located near two or more edge devices in the substrate computer network that are used as translation manager modules and may provide functionality that includes selecting between those two or more alternative edge devices for particular communications e.g. a router device that treats two or more of the edge devices as alternatives for a specified anycast address that provides equal cost multi path routing to two or more of the alternative edge devices etc. and that optionally provides flow hashing functionality to maintain use of a particular translation manager module for a flow of multiple communications between a particular source final destination pair. Alternatively a load balancer device may be configured to receive communications directed to a particular network address that is associated with a pool of multiple alternative translation manager modules and to select a particular translation manager module to use for each of the communications based on various criteria e.g. current load of the various possible translation manager modules . If such networking devices or other components are used in a particular embodiment communication manager modules in that embodiment may be configured to support such networking devices or other components in various manners as discussed in greater detail below.

As noted above in at least some embodiments the described techniques include managing communications for a managed computer network being provided including in embodiments in which the managed computer network is a virtual computer network that is overlaid on one or more underlying substrate computer networks. In such embodiments communications may be encoded in various manners before being sent over an underlying substrate network e.g. to use substrate network addresses for the communication source and or final destination in the encoded communication that are distinct from virtual network addresses used for the communication source and or final destination in the original pre encoded communication and the described techniques may be used in conjunction with such encoded communications as discussed in greater detail below. Before discussing some additional details of managing such communications in particular manners however some aspects of such managed computer networks in at least some embodiments are introduced.

In particular a managed computer network between multiple computing nodes may be provided in various ways in various embodiments such as in the form of a virtual computer network that is created as an overlay network using one or more intermediate physical networks that separate the multiple computing nodes. In such embodiments the intermediate physical network s may be used as a substrate network on which the overlay virtual computer network is provided with messages between computing nodes of the overlay virtual computer network being passed over the intermediate physical network s but with the existence and use of the intermediate physical network s being transparent to the computing nodes e.g. with the computing nodes being unaware of and or being unable to detect the intermediate physical networks in at least some such embodiments. For example the multiple computing nodes may each have a distinct physical substrate network address that corresponds to a location of the computing node within the intermediate physical network s such as a substrate IP Internet Protocol network address e.g. an IP network address that is specified in accordance with IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4 or in accordance with IPv6 or Internet Protocol version 6 such as to reflect the networking protocol used by the intermediate physical networks . In other embodiments a substrate network on which a virtual computer network is overlaid may itself include or be composed of one or more other virtual computer networks such as other virtual computer networks implemented by one or more third parties e.g. by an operator or provider of Internet or telecom infrastructure .

When computing nodes are selected to participate in a managed computer network that is being provided on behalf of a user or other entity and that is a virtual computer network overlaid on a substrate network each computing node may be assigned one or more virtual network addresses for the provided virtual computer network that are unrelated to those computing nodes substrate network addresses such as from a range of virtual network addresses used for the provided virtual computer network in at least some embodiments and situations the virtual computer network being provided may further use a networking protocol that is different from the networking protocol used by the substrate network e.g. with the virtual computer network using the IPv4 networking protocol and the substrate computer network using the IPv6 networking protocol . The computing nodes of the virtual computer network inter communicate using the virtual network addresses e.g. by sending a communication to another destination computing node by specifying that destination computing node s virtual network address as the destination network address for the communication but the substrate network may be configured to route or otherwise forward communications based on substrate network addresses e.g. by physical network router devices and other physical networking devices of the substrate network . If so the overlay virtual computer network may be implemented from the logical edge of the intermediate physical network s by modifying the communications that enter the intermediate physical network s to encode the communications for the intermediate physical networks e.g. to use substrate network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the substrate network and by modifying the communications that leave the intermediate physical network s to decode the communications e.g. to use virtual network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the virtual computer network if the decoded communication is to be provided to a computing node of the virtual computer network to use external public network addresses if the decoded communication is to be forwarded over one or more external public networks etc. . Additional details related to the provision of such an overlay virtual computer network are included below.

In at least some embodiments a network accessible configurable network service CNS is provided by a corresponding CNS system and the CNS system provides managed overlay virtual computer networks to remote customers e.g. users and other entities such as by providing and using numerous computing nodes that are in one or more geographical locations e.g. in one or more data centers and that are inter connected via one or more intermediate physical networks. The CNS system may use various communication manager modules and or translation manager modules at the edge of the one or more intermediate physical networks to manage communications for the various overlay virtual computer networks as they enter and leave the intermediate physical network s and may use one or more system manager modules to coordinate other operations of the CNS system. For example to enable the communication manager modules and or translation manager modules to manage communications for the overlay virtual computer networks being provided the CNS system may track and use various information about the computing nodes and external network nodes of each virtual computer network being managed such as to map the substrate network address of each such computing node to the one or more overlay virtual network addresses associated with the computing node and such as to map the external network address of each such external network node to the one or more overlay virtual network addresses associated with the external network node. Such mapping and other information may be stored and propagated in various manners in various embodiments including centrally or in a distributed manner as discussed in greater detail below.

Furthermore in order to provide managed virtual computer networks to users and other entities in a desired manner the CNS system allows users and other entities to interact with the CNS system in at least some embodiments to configure a variety of types of information for virtual computer networks that are provided by the CNS system on behalf of the users or other entities and may track and use such configuration information as part of providing those virtual computer networks. The configuration information for a particular managed virtual computer network having multiple computing nodes may include for example one or more of the following non exclusive list a quantity of the multiple computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network one or more particular computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network one or more external network nodes to associate with the virtual computer network a range or other group of multiple virtual network addresses to associate with the multiple computing nodes and external network nodes of the virtual computer network particular virtual network addresses to associate with particular computing nodes particular groups of related computing nodes particular external network nodes or particular groups of related external network nodes a type of at least some of the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network such as to reflect quantities and or types of computing resources to be included with or otherwise available to the computing nodes a geographic location at which some or all of the computing nodes of the virtual computer network are to be located network topology information for the virtual computer network such as to specify logical subnets and or other logical topology of the virtual computer network etc. In addition the configuration information for a virtual computer network may be specified by a user or other entity in various manners in various embodiments such as by an executing program of the user or other entity that interacts with an API application programming interface provided by the CNS system for that purpose and or by a user that interactively uses a GUI graphical user interface provided by the CNS system for that purpose.

In particular in the illustrated example of a configurable network service CNS is available that provides functionality to clients not shown over one or more public networks e.g. over the Internet to enable the clients to access and use managed computer networks provided to the clients by the CNS including to enable the remote clients to dynamically modify and extend the capabilities of their remote existing private computer networks using cloud computing techniques over the public network . In the example of a number of clients interact over the public network with a system manager module of the CNS to create and configure various managed computer networks being provided by the CNS with at least some of the provided computer networks optionally being private computer network extensions to remote existing client private networks and with at least some such of those provided computer network extensions being configured to enable access from one or more corresponding client private networks over the public network e.g. private access via VPN connections established over interconnections and or access via other types of private or non private interconnections . In this example embodiment the system manager module assists in providing functionality of the CNS to the remote clients such as in conjunction with various optional other modules of the CNS e.g. various communication manager modules in conjunction with various optional computing nodes and or networking devices e.g. substrate network router devices edge devices etc. that are used by the CNS to provide the managed computer networks . In at least some embodiments the CNS system manager module may execute on one or more computing systems not shown of the CNS and may provide one or more APIs that enable remote computing systems to programmatically interact with the module to access some or all functionality of the CNS on behalf of clients e.g. to create configure and or initiate use of managed computer networks . In addition in at least some embodiments clients may instead manually interact with the module e.g. via a GUI provided by the module to perform some or all such actions.

The public network in may be for example a publicly accessible network of linked networks possibly operated by distinct parties such as the Internet. The remote client private networks may each include one or more existing private networks such as a corporate or other private network e.g. home university etc. that is partially or wholly inaccessible to non privileged users and that includes computing systems and or other networked devices not shown of a client. In the illustrated example the provided computer networks each include multiple computing nodes not shown at least some of which may be from the plurality of optional computing nodes provided by or otherwise under the control of the CNS while in other embodiments at least some other computing systems may be used to provide some or all computing nodes for one or more of the provided computer networks such other computing systems may for example be provided by or under control of the client for whom a computer network that uses those other computing systems is provided or may be computing systems that are provided by third parties e.g. for a fee . In addition one or more of the provided computer networks may each include one or more external network nodes that are integrated into the provided computer network such as an external network node that is one of the other computing systems e.g. operated under control of an entity other than a provider or operator of the configurable network service such as a client to whom the computer network is provided or instead a third party to the client and the configurable network service provider or that is located within one of the private networks for the client to whom the computer network is provided e.g. operated under control of the client . Each of the provided computer networks may be configured in various ways by the clients for whom they are provided and may each be a private computer network that is accessible only by the client that creates it although in other embodiments at least some computer networks provided by the CNS for clients may be publicly accessible. Similarly while at least some of the provided computer networks in the example may be extensions to remote client computer networks that are private networks in other embodiments the provided computer networks may be standalone computer networks that are not extensions to other existing computer networks and or may be extensions to other client computer networks that are not private networks.

Private access between a remote client private computer network and a corresponding private computer network extension provided for a client may be enabled in various ways such as by establishing a VPN connection or other private connection between them that allows intercommunication over the public network in a private manner. For example the CNS may automatically perform appropriate configuration on its computing nodes and other networking devices to enable VPN access to a particular private network extension of a client such as by automatically configuring one or more VPN mechanisms hosted by the CNS e.g. software and or hardware VPN mechanisms and or may automatically provide appropriate configuration information to the client e.g. credentials access points and or other parameters to allow a VPN mechanism hosted on the remote client private network e.g. a software VPN endpoint that is provided by one of the multiple computing nodes of the provided network extension to establish the VPN access. After VPN access has been appropriately enabled and or configured a VPN connection may be established between the remote client private network and the provided private network extension such as initiated by the client using IPsec Internet Protocol Security or instead a VPN connection or other private connection may be established to or between networks that use MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching for data transmission or other appropriate communication technologies. In addition in the illustrated example various network accessible remote resource services may optionally be available to remote computing systems over the public network including to computing nodes on the remote client private networks . The resource services may provide various functionality to the remote computing nodes such as for at least some of the resource services to provide remote computing nodes with access to various types of network accessible computing related resources e.g. long term storage capabilities such as block storage that is mountable by particular computing nodes of the provided computer networks or storage that is otherwise accessible from particular computing nodes of the provided computer networks using API calls . Furthermore at least some of the computer networks that are provided by the CNS may be configured to provide access to at least some of the remote resource services with that provided access optionally appearing to computing nodes of the provided computer networks as being locally provided via virtual connections that are part of the provided computer networks although the actual communications with the remote resource services may occur over the public networks e.g. via interconnections and . In addition in at least some embodiments multiple distinct provided computer networks may be configured to enable inter access with each other.

The provided computer networks may each be configured by clients in various manners. For example in at least some embodiments the CNS provides various computing nodes that are available for use with computer networks provided to clients such that each provided computer network may include a client configured quantity of multiple such computing nodes that are dedicated for use as part of that provided computer network. In particular a client may interact with the module to configure a quantity of computing nodes to initially be included in a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS . In addition the CNS may provide multiple different types of computing nodes in at least some embodiments such as for example computing nodes with various performance characteristics e.g. processor speed memory available storage available etc. and or other capabilities. If so in at least some such embodiments a client may specify the types of computing nodes to be included in a provided computer network for the client. In addition in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure network addresses for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS and network addresses may later be dynamically added removed or modified for a provided computer network of a client in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client. Furthermore in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure network topology information for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS including to specify one or more external network nodes for the provided computer network and such network topology information may later be dynamically modified for a provided computer network in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client. Moreover in at least some embodiments a client may interact with the module to configure various network access constraint information for a computer network provided for the client e.g. via one or more programmatic interactions with an API provided by the CNS and such network access constraint information may later be dynamically modified for a provided computer network in at least some such embodiments such as after the provided computer network has already been in use by the client.

Network addresses may be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example the client may specify one or more address ranges e.g. a Classless Inter Domain Routing CIDR address block or other groups of network addresses for the provided computer network such that at least some of the specified network addresses are used for the computing nodes of the provided computer network and with those specified network addresses optionally being a subset of network addresses used by an existing remote client computer network if the provided computer network is configured to be an extension to the remote client computer network. Such configured network addresses may in some situations be virtual or private network addresses that are not directly addressable from computing systems on the public network e.g. if the existing remote client computer network and the corresponding provided network extension use network address translation techniques and or virtual networking techniques for the client computer network and its provided network extension while in other situations at least some of the configured network addresses may be external public network addresses that are directly addressable from computing systems on the public network e.g. a public network address that is a static Internet routable IP address or other non changing network address . In other embodiments the CNS may automatically select network addresses to be assigned to at least some computing nodes of at least some provided computer networks and or at least some external network nodes of at least some provided computer networks such as based on network addresses that are available for use by the CNS based on selecting network addresses that are related to network addresses used by remote existing computer networks corresponding to the provided computer networks etc. Furthermore if two or more of the computer networks provided by the CNS are configured to enable inter communications between the provided computer networks e.g. for two or more computer networks provided to a single customer such as for different departments or groups within a single organization for two or more computer networks provided to two or more distinct customers etc. the CNS may in some embodiments automatically select network addresses to be used for at least some computing nodes of those provided computer networks to facilitate the inter communications such as by using different network addresses for the various provided computer networks. In addition in at least some embodiments in which the CNS provides virtual networks to clients such as by using overlay networks on a substrate network each client may be allowed to specify any network addresses to be used for their provided computer networks even if multiple clients specify the same or overlapping network addresses for their respective provided computer networks in such embodiments the CNS manages the network addresses distinctly for each client such that a first client may have a first computing node associated with a particular specified network address for the first client s provided computer network while a distinct second client may have a distinct second computing node associated with the same particular specified network address for the second client s provided computer network. Once network addresses are configured or otherwise determined for a provided computer network the CNS may assign the network addresses to various of the computing nodes selected for the provided computer network such as in a random manner by using DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or other techniques for dynamic assignment of network addresses etc.

Network topology information may be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example a client may specify particular types of networking devices e.g. routers switches etc. and or other network devices or nodes e.g. load balancers firewalls proxies network storage devices printers etc. to be part of the provided computer network and may specify interconnectivity information between networking devices and computing nodes. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the CNS may provide available computing nodes in multiple geographical locations e.g. in multiple geographically distributed data centers and the configuration information specified by a client for a provided computer network may further indicate one or more geographical locations in which computing nodes of the provided computer network are to be located e.g. to provide fault tolerance among the computing nodes of a provided computer network by having them located in multiple geographical locations and or may otherwise provide information about preferences or requirements of how the computing nodes of the provided computer network are to interoperate that is used by the CNS to select one or more such geographical locations e.g. minimum or maximum network latency or bandwidth for computing node intercommunications minimum or maximum network proximity between computing nodes minimum or maximum geographic proximity between computing nodes having local access to particular resources or functionality that is not available in all such geographic locations having specified locations relative to other external computing systems such as to a remote computer network of the client and or to a remote resource service constraints or other preferences based on the cost of obtaining use of particular computing nodes and or for particular types of interactions with particular computing nodes such as costs associated with providing data to and or from those computing nodes etc. . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in at least some embodiments the interconnections and intercommunications between computing nodes of a provided computer network are managed using an underlying substrate network not shown of the CNS and if so some or all of the configured network topology information may be simulated or otherwise emulated in at least some such embodiments using the underlying substrate network and corresponding modules of the CNS . For example each of the computing nodes provided by the CNS may be associated with a node communication manager module of the CNS that manages communications to and from its associated computing node s and if so the associated communication manager module for a computing node may take various actions to emulate desired functionality of a network with respect to that computing node as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Similarly one or more external network nodes may be specified for a particular provided virtual computer network and each of the external network nodes may be associated with a translation manager module of the CNS that manages communications to and from its associated external network node s and if so the associated translation manager module for an external network node may take various actions to emulate desired functionality of a network with respect to that external network node as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Network access constraint information may also be configured for a provided computer network in various manners in various embodiments. For example a client may specify information about whether and how some or all of the computing nodes of a provided computer network are allowed to communicate with other computing nodes of the provided computer network and or with other external computing systems such as based on one or more of the following directions of communications incoming versus outgoing types of communications e.g. based on the types of content included and or the types of communication protocols used such as to allow HTTP requests for text but not images and to not allow FTP requests locations of other computing systems e.g. whether part of the provided computer network part of a remote client computer network corresponding to the provided computer network part of a remote resource service to which access has been established external to the provided computer network and any corresponding remote client computer network etc. types of other computing systems etc. In a manner similar to that for network topology information the CNS may enforce network access constraint information for provided computer networks in various manners.

Thus managed computer networks may be provided for clients in various manners in various embodiments and may be configured to have various types of functionality in various embodiments.

In addition in at least some embodiments the computing nodes of the managed computer networks may be physical computing systems and or may be virtual machines that are each hosted on one or more physical computing systems and the communications that are handled for managed computer networks may include transmissions of data e.g. messages packets frames streams etc. in various formats. As previously noted some or all computing nodes used for a particular provided overlay virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided by the CNS system for use by users while in other embodiments some or all such computing nodes may instead be provided by a user who uses those computing nodes. Similarly external network nodes may have various forms and be provided by the CNS system or by other entities that are unrelated to the operator of the CNS system in various embodiments. Furthermore in at least some situations an embodiment of the CNS system may be part of or otherwise affiliated with a program execution service or PES that executes multiple programs on behalf of multiple customers or other users of the service such as a program execution service that uses multiple computing systems on multiple physical networks e.g. multiple physical computing systems and networks within a data center . In at least some such embodiments virtual computer networks to which computing nodes belong may be selected based on associated users such as based on the computing nodes executing programs on behalf of a user or other entity.

As previously noted a virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided as an overlay network that uses one or more intermediate physical networks as a substrate network and one or more such overlay virtual computer networks may be implemented over the substrate network in various ways in various embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments communications between nodes of an overlay virtual computer network are managed by encoding and sending those communications over the substrate network without encapsulating the communications such as by embedding virtual network address information for a computing node of the virtual computer network e.g. the destination computing node s virtual network address in a larger physical network address space used for a networking protocol of the one or more intermediate physical networks while in other embodiments the communications are encoded in other manners e.g. by storing virtual network address information from the pre encoded communication in one or more header fields of the encoded communication or otherwise in a manner associated with the encoded communications such as if the overlay virtual computer network and underlying substrate network use the same networking protocol . As one illustrative example a virtual computer network may be implemented using 32 bit IPv4 network addresses and those 32 bit virtual network addresses may be embedded as part of 128 bit IPv6 network addresses used by the one or more intermediate physical networks such as by reheadering communication packets or other data transmissions e.g. using Stateless IP ICMP Translation or SIIT or otherwise modifying such data transmissions to translate them from a first networking protocol for which they are configured to a distinct second networking protocol. As another illustrative example both the virtual computer network and substrate computer network may be implemented using the same network addressing protocol e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 and data transmissions sent via the provided overlay virtual computer network using virtual network addresses may be modified to use different physical network addresses corresponding to the substrate network while the transmissions are sent over the substrate network but with the original virtual network addresses being stored in the modified data transmissions or otherwise tracked so that the data transmissions may be restored to their original form when they exit the substrate network. In other embodiments at least some of the overlay computer networks may be implemented using encapsulation of communications. Additional details related to SIIT are available at Request For Comments 2765 Stateless IP ICMP Translation Algorithm February 2000 Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This document is also available at the time of filing at toolsietforghtmlrfc2765 where and are replaced by the corresponding characters with those names . and respectively .

Furthermore in addition to managing configured network topologies for provided virtual computer networks the CNS system may use the described techniques to provide various other benefits in various situations such as limiting communications to and or from computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network to other computing nodes that belong to that virtual computer network. In this manner computing nodes that belong to multiple virtual computer networks may share parts of one or more intermediate physical networks while still maintaining network isolation for computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network. In addition the use of the described techniques also allows computing nodes to easily be added to and or removed from a virtual computer network such as to allow a user to dynamically modify the size of a virtual computer network e.g. to dynamically modify the quantity of computing nodes to reflect an amount of current need for more or less computing resources . Furthermore the use of the described techniques also supports changes to an underlying substrate network for example if the underlying substrate network is expanded to include additional computing nodes at additional geographical locations existing or new virtual computer networks being provided may seamlessly use those additional computing nodes since the underlying substrate network will route communications to and from the substrate network addresses for those additional computing nodes in the same manner as for other previously existing substrate network computing nodes. In at least some embodiments the underlying substrate network may be of any size e.g. spanning multiple countries or continents without regard to network latency between computing nodes at different locations.

At least some such benefits may similarly apply for logical sub networks or subnets that are specified for such a particular provided virtual computer network with the substrate network functionality used to emulate various functionality corresponding to the specified logical subnets. For example the use of the underlying substrate network may enable different computing nodes assigned to a particular logical subnet to be located at any position within the substrate network with the substrate network forwarding communications to destination computing nodes based on those destination computing nodes substrate network addresses. As such the substrate network may support specified logical subnets or other configured network topology for a managed computer network without any configuration for or other use of information about such specified logical subnets and with the CNS system modules e.g. communication manager modules instead managing the corresponding functionality from the logical edges of the substrate network where the CNS system modules connect to the substrate network.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which specific types of computing nodes networks communications network topologies and configuration operations are performed. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity and the inventive techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations some of which are discussed below.

The illustrated example includes an example data center with multiple physical computing systems operated on behalf of the CNS system. The example data center is connected via one or more edge devices to an internet external to the data center which provides access to one or more computing systems and possible external network nodes located within private network to one or more other globally accessible data centers that each have multiple computing systems not shown and may include possible external network nodes not shown and to one or more other computing systems that may be possible external network nodes. Some or all of the edge devices may be configured to operate as or otherwise implement one or more translation manager modules to manage external network nodes. The internet may be for example a publicly accessible network of networks possibly operated by various distinct parties such as the Internet and the private network may be for example a corporate network that is wholly or partially inaccessible from computing systems external to the private network . Computing systems may be for example home computing systems or mobile computing devices that each connects directly to the Internet e.g. via a telephone line cable modem a Digital Subscriber Line DSL cellular network or other wireless connection etc. .

The example data center includes a number of physical computing systems and as well as a Communication Manager module that executes on one or more other computing systems or devices not shown to manage communications for the associated computing systems and a System Manager module that executes on one or more computing systems not shown . In this example each physical computing system hosts multiple virtual machine computing nodes and includes an associated virtual machine VM communication manager module e.g. as part of a virtual machine hypervisor monitor for the physical computing system such as VM Communication Manager module and multiple virtual machines on host computing system and such as VM Communication Manager module and multiple virtual machines on host computing system . Physical computing systems do not execute any virtual machines in this example and thus may each act as a computing node that directly executes one or more software programs on behalf of a user. The Communication Manager module that manages communications for the associated computing systems may be implemented as part of various types of devices separate from the physical computing systems such as for example a proxy computing device a firewall device or a networking device e.g. a switch router hub etc. through which communications to and from the physical computing systems travel. In other embodiments all or none of the physical computing systems at the data center may host virtual machines.

This example data center further includes multiple physical networking devices such as switches edge router devices and core router devices . Switch is part of a physical sub network that includes physical computing systems and is connected to edge router . Switch is part of a distinct physical sub network that includes physical computing systems and as well as the computing systems providing the Communication Manager module and the System Manager module and is connected to edge router . The physical sub networks established by switches in turn are connected to each other and other networks e.g. the internet via an intermediate interconnection network which includes the edge routers and the core routers . The edge routers provide gateways between two or more physical sub networks or networks. For example edge router provides a gateway between the physical sub network established by switch and the interconnection network while edge router provides a gateway between the interconnection network and internet e.g. via the edge devices . The core routers manage communications within the interconnection network such as by routing or otherwise forwarding packets or other data transmissions as appropriate based on characteristics of such data transmissions e.g. header information including source and or destination addresses protocol identifiers etc. and or the characteristics of the interconnection network itself e.g. routes based on the physical network topology etc. . In addition the edge devices may further manage communications between computing nodes at the data center and other external computer systems that are not external network nodes integrated into one or more virtual computer networks overlaid on the interconnection network as a substrate e.g. external computing systems external computing systems computing systems at other external data centers etc. .

The illustrated System Manager module Communication Manager modules and edge device Translation Manager modules may perform at least some of the described techniques in order to configure authorize and otherwise manage communications sent to and from associated computing nodes including to support providing various virtual networking functionality for one or more virtual computer networks that are provided using various of the computing nodes and or to support providing various emulated functionality for one or more virtual networking devices that are configured for one or more such provided virtual computer networks. For example Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes and each of the other Communication Manager modules may similarly manage communications for a group of one or more other associated computing nodes. The illustrated Communication Manager modules may configure communications between computing nodes so as to overlay one or more particular virtual networks over one or more intermediate physical networks that are used as a substrate network such as over the interconnection network . Furthermore a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in some embodiments by using the edge device translation manager modules to assist in integrating one or more external network nodes outside of the data center into the virtual computer network. In other embodiments a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in other manners such as if one or more other data centers also provide computing nodes that are available for use by the example CNS system and the particular virtual network includes computing nodes at two or more such data centers at two or more distinct geographical locations. Multiple such data centers or other geographical locations of one or more computing nodes may be inter connected in various manners including the following directly via one or more public networks in a non private manner or via a private connection not shown e.g. a dedicated physical connection that is not shared with any third parties such as a leased line or a VPN or other mechanism that provides the private connection over a public network etc. In addition while not illustrated here other such data centers or other geographical locations may each include one or more other Communication Manager modules that manage communications for computing systems at that data center or other geographical location as well as over the global internet to the data center and any other such data centers .

In addition a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center in other manners in other embodiments such as if one or more other Communication Manager modules at the data center are placed between edge router and the global internet e.g. if the edge devices each provide at least some of the functionality of a Communication Manager module in encoding and decoding communications for virtual computer networks to use the underlying substrate network or instead based on one or more other Communication Manager modules external to the data center e.g. if another Communication Manager module not shown is made part of private network so as to manage communications for computing systems over the internet and private network etc. . Thus for example if an organization operating private network desires to virtually extend its private computer network to one or more of the computing nodes of the data center it may do so by implementing one or more Communication Manager modules as part of the private network e.g. as part of the interface between the private network and the internet in this manner computing systems within the private network may communicate with those data center computing nodes as if those data center computing nodes were part of the private network. In other embodiments the private computer network may instead be extended to one or more computing nodes of the data center by the module of the data center managing the communications between computing nodes of the private network and particular data center computing nodes.

Thus as one illustrative example one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system in this example virtual machine computing node may be part of the same provided virtual computer network as one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system in this example virtual machine computing node and may further both be assigned to a specified logical subnet of that virtual computer network that includes a subset of the computing nodes for that virtual computer network such as with the IPv4 networking protocol being used to represent the virtual network addresses for the virtual computer network. The virtual machine may then direct an outgoing communication not shown to the destination virtual machine computing node such as by specifying a virtual network address for that destination virtual machine computing node e.g. a virtual network address that is unique for the local broadcast domain of the specified logical subnet . The Communication Manager module receives the outgoing communication and in at least some embodiments determines whether to authorize the sending of the outgoing communication such as based on previously obtained information about the sending virtual machine computing node and or about the destination virtual machine computing node e.g. information about virtual computer networks and or entities with which the computing nodes are associated information about any specified logical subnets to which the computing nodes belong etc. and or by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module e.g. to obtain an authorization determination to obtain some or all such information etc. . By not delivering unauthorized communications to computing nodes network isolation and security of entities virtual computer networks is enhanced.

If the Communication Manager module determines that the outgoing communication is authorized or does not perform such an authorization determination the module determines the actual physical network location corresponding to the destination virtual network address for the communication. For example the Communication Manager module may determine the actual destination network address to use for the virtual network address of the destination virtual machine by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module or may have previously determined and stored that information e.g. in response to a request from the sending virtual machine for information about that destination virtual network address such as a request that the virtual machine specifies using Address Resolution Protocol or ARP . The Communication Manager module then re headers or otherwise modifies the outgoing communication so that it is directed to Communication Manager module using an actual substrate network address such as if Communication Manager module is associated with a range of multiple such actual substrate network addresses. provide examples of doing such communication management in some embodiments.

When Communication Manager module receives the communication via the interconnection network in this example it obtains the virtual destination network address for the communication e.g. by extracting the virtual destination network address from the communication and determines to which of the virtual machine computing nodes managed by the Communication Manager module that the communication is directed. The Communication Manager module next determines whether the communication is authorized for the destination virtual machine computing node with examples of such authorization activities discussed in further detail in the examples of . If the communication is determined to be authorized or the Communication Manager module does not perform such an authorization determination the Communication Manager module then re headers or otherwise modifies the incoming communication so that it is directed to the destination virtual machine computing node using an appropriate virtual network address for the virtual computer network such as by using the sending virtual machine computing node s virtual network address as the source network address and by using the destination virtual machine computing node s virtual network address as the destination network address. The Communication Manager module then forwards or otherwise provides the modified communication to the destination virtual machine computing node such as via shared memory not shown of the computing system that is used to provide a logical network interface for the destination virtual machine computing node . In at least some embodiments before forwarding the incoming communication to the destination virtual machine the Communication Manager module may also perform additional steps related to security as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In addition while not illustrated in in some embodiments the various Communication Manager modules may take further actions to provide virtual networking functionality corresponding to a specified network topology for the provided virtual computer network e.g. for one or more virtual networking devices for the provided virtual computer network such as by managing communications between computing nodes of the provided virtual computer network in specified manners and by responding to other types of requests sent by computing nodes of the virtual computer network. For example although being separated from computing node on physical computing system by the interconnection network in the example embodiment of virtual machine computing node on physical computing system may be configured to be part of the same logical sub network of the virtual computer network as computing node e.g. to not be separated by any logical router devices specified for the provided virtual computer network . Conversely despite the physical proximity of virtual machine computing node on physical computing system to virtual machine computing node on physical computing system i.e. being part of the same physical sub network without any intervening physical substrate router devices in the example embodiment of computing node may be configured to be part of a distinct logical sub network of the virtual computer network from that of computing node e.g. may be configured to be separated by one or more specified router devices of the provided virtual computer network not shown which in this example are virtual router devices that are not physically provided for the virtual computer network . If computing nodes and are configured to be part of the same logical sub network the previous example of sending a communication from computing node to computing node may be performed in the manner previously described without emulating the actions of any intervening virtual router devices despite the use of multiple physical router devices in the substrate interconnection network for forwarding the communication since computing nodes and are configured to be part of single sub network in the specified network topology.

However if computing node sends an additional communication to computing node the Communication Manager modules and or on the host computing systems and may perform additional actions that correspond to one or more virtual specified router devices configured in the specified network topology for the provided virtual computer network to separate the computing nodes and . For example the source computing node may send the additional communication in such a manner as to initially direct it to a first of the virtual specified router devices that is configured to be local to computing node e.g. by including a virtual hardware address in the header of the additional communication that corresponds to that first virtual specified router device with that first virtual specified router device being expected to forward the additional communication on toward the destination computing node via the specified logical network topology. If so the source Communication Manager module may detect that forwarding of the additional communication to the virtual first router device e.g. based on the virtual hardware address used in the header of the additional communication or otherwise be aware of the configured network topology for the virtual computer network and may take actions to emulate functionality of some or all of the virtual specified router devices that are configured in the specified network topology to separate the computing nodes and . For example each virtual router device that forwards the additional communication may be expected to take actions such as modifying a TTL time to live hop value for the communication modify a virtual destination hardware address that is specified for the communication to indicate the next intended destination of the additional communication on a route to the destination computing node and or otherwise modify the communication header. If so the source Communication Manager module may perform some or all of those actions before forwarding the additional communication directly to the destination Communication Manager module over the substrate network in this case via physical switch device for provision to destination computing node . Alternatively some or all such additional actions to provide the virtual networking functionality for the sent additional communication may instead be performed by the destination Communication Manager module after the additional communication is forwarded to the Communication Manager module by the Communication Manager module

Furthermore as part of the prior continuing example computing node may determine to send a third communication to a final destination computer system external to the data center and the interconnection network such as to a particular external network node that is integrated into the computer network to which computing node belongs or such as to a particular computing system e.g. with the particular computing system not being part of the virtual computer network to which computing node belongs . In this situation the Communication Manager module on the host computing system that is associated with the source computing node may further perform additional actions to support the use of an intermediate destination for the communication. If the third communication is being sent to a particular external network node the Communication Manager module determines that the external network node is associated with one of the edge device translation manager modules and encodes the outgoing third communication from the source computing node for forwarding over the substrate network from the host computing system to that edge device . That edge device translation manager module then receives the encoded third communication decodes the received communication by removing substrate specific information and or formatting determines a particular external network address of the destination external network node e.g. based on a mapping of that external network address to a virtual network address assigned to the destination external network node optionally adds network identifying information to the decoded communication and forwards the decoded communication over the internet to the destination external network node . For example in order to determine how to forward the third communication to the destination external network node the edge device translation manager module may identify the type of encoding to use for that destination external network node e.g. a particular publicly routable external network address associated with the destination external network node such as to direct the communication to the edge of the private network and or various information specific to the private network such as information about a VLAN identifier or MPLS label that the private network uses to represent the managed virtual computer network and encode the communication accordingly. By providing virtual networking functionality using the described techniques the CNS system provides various benefits. For example because the various Communication Manager modules and Translation Manager modules manage the overlay virtual network specified networking devices and other network topology do not need to be physically implemented for virtual computer networks being provided and thus corresponding modifications are not needed to the interconnection network to support particular configured network topologies. Nonetheless if the computing nodes and software programs of a virtual computer network have been configured to expect a particular network topology for the provided virtual computer network the appearance and functionality of that network topology may nonetheless be transparently provided for those computing nodes by the described techniques. In addition the use of the described techniques by the CNS system enables external network nodes to be integrated into virtual computer networks and used in specified manners such as to enable the virtual computer network to obtain access to functionality that may not otherwise be available.

Thus various aspects of providing managed computer networks are described above as well as elsewhere in this document including to support virtual computer networks that are overlaid on an underlying substrate network. In addition in at least some embodiments the CNS system may use multiple communication manager modules in additional manners such as to emulate responses to networking requests made by computing nodes in the manner of a local physical networking device including to respond to ping requests SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol queries etc. Furthermore as described in greater detail below in at least some embodiments multiple modules of the CNS system may operate together in a distributed manner to provide a particular type of functionality e.g. functionality corresponding to a particular logical networking device such that no single module or physical device is singly responsible for emulating that particular type of functionality as well as to provide functionality corresponding to integrating external network nodes into virtual computer networks.

In particular illustrates various example computing nodes and that may communicate with each other by using one or more intermediate interconnection networks as a substrate network. In this example IPv4 virtual computer networks are overlaid on an underlying substrate interconnection network with the substrate network being for example a distinct IPv4 network or an IPv6 substrate network although in other embodiments the interconnection network and overlay virtual computer networks may use other networking protocols. In addition in this example embodiment the computing nodes are operated on behalf of multiple distinct entities to whom managed computer networks are provided and a System Manager module manages the association of particular computing nodes with particular entities and managed virtual computer networks and tracks various configuration information specified for the managed virtual computer networks. The example computing nodes of include four computing nodes that are executed on behalf of an example entity Z and that are part of a corresponding first managed virtual computer network provided for client entity Z those being computing nodes and . In addition other computing nodes are operated on behalf of other entities and belong to other provided virtual computer networks such as computing node that is part of a second managed virtual computer network provided for client entity Y as well as other computing nodes .

In this example the computing nodes are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module R and the computing nodes are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module S . The CNS Communication Manager modules and are physically connected to an interconnection network as is the System Manager module although the physical interconnections between computing nodes modules and the interconnection network are not illustrated in this example. As one example computing nodes may each be one of multiple virtual machines hosted by a single physical computing system and Communication Manager module R may be part of a hypervisor virtual machine monitor for that physical computing system if so communications between the computing nodes and the Communication Manager module R may be passed within that physical computing system without using any intervening computer network such as via memory of the physical computing system an internal bus of the physical computing system etc. For example with reference to computing nodes may represent the virtual machines and computing nodes may represent the virtual machines . If so Communication Manager module R would correspond to Communication Manager module of Communication Manager module S would correspond to Communication Manager module of the interconnection network would correspond to interconnection network of and the System Manager module would correspond to System Manager module of . Alternatively computing nodes or may instead each be a distinct physical computing system such as to correspond to computing systems of or to computing nodes at other data centers or geographical locations e.g. computing systems at another data center computing systems etc. .

In this example each of the Communication Manager modules of is associated with a group of multiple physical substrate network addresses which the Communication Manager modules manage on behalf of their associated computing nodes although in other embodiments each Communication Manager module may instead use a single substrate network address that it shares among two or more associated computing nodes. For example if the interconnection network is an IPv4 network Communication Manager module R may be associated with the IPv4 CIDR block 200.0.0.0 29 so as to enable at least some of the IPv4 addresses from 200.0.0.0 to 200.0.0.7 to each be treated as a substrate network address associated with one of the computing nodes and Communication Manager module S may similarly be associated with the 16 IPv4 network addresses in the IPv4 CIDR block 200.0.10.0 28. Alternatively if the interconnection network is an IPv6 network Communication Manager module R may for example be associated with the IPv6 network address range of 0A 01 72 which corresponds to the 128 bit addresses in hexadecimal from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXA 0100 0000 0000 0000 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXA 01FF FFFF FFFF FFFF representing 2 to the power of 56 unique IPv6 addresses where each X may represent any hexadecimal character that is appropriate for a particular situation if so the interconnection network will forward any communication with a destination network address in that range to Communication Manager module R and with the initial 72 bits of the range specified the Communication Manager module R may use the remaining available 56 bits to represent the computing nodes that it manages and to determine how to process incoming communications whose destination network addresses are in that range. If the interconnection network is an IPv6 network the Communication Manager module S may similarly be associated with an IPv6 network address range such as 0B 02 72 .

For purposes of the example shown in computing nodes and are part of a single managed virtual computer network provided for entity Z and computing nodes and have assigned IPv4 virtual network addresses of 10.0.0.2 10.0.5.1 and 10.0.0.3 respectively. Because computing node is part of a distinct managed virtual computer network that is provided for entity Y it can share the same virtual network address as computing node without confusion. In this example computing node A intends to communicate with computing node G with the two computing nodes configured in this example to be part of a single common physical local area sub network not shown in a configured network topology for the managed virtual computer network and the interconnection network and Communication Manager modules are transparent to computing nodes A and G in this example. In particular despite the physical separation of computing nodes A and G the Communication Manager modules and operate so as to overlay the managed virtual computer network for entity Z over the physical interconnection network for communications between those computing nodes including to emulate functionality corresponding to the configured local area sub network of the managed virtual computer network so that the lack of an actual local area sub network is transparent to the computing nodes A and G.

In order to send the communication to computing node G computing node A exchanges various messages with Communication Manager module R despite in the illustrated embodiment being unaware of the existence of Communication Manager module R i.e. computing node A may believe that it is transmitting a broadcast message to all other nodes on the local sub network such as via a specified switching device that computing node A believes connects the nodes on the local sub network . In particular in this example computing node A first sends an ARP message request that includes the virtual network address for computing node G i.e. 10.0.0.3 and that requests the corresponding hardware address for computing node G e.g. a 48 bit MAC address . Communication Manager module R intercepts the ARP request and responds to computing node A with a spoofed ARP response message that includes a virtual hardware address for computing node G.

To obtain the virtual hardware address for computing node G to use with the response message the Communication Manager module R first checks a local store of information that maps virtual hardware addresses to corresponding actual physical substrate network addresses with each of the virtual hardware addresses also corresponding to an IPv4 virtual network address for a particular entity s managed virtual computer network. If the local store does not contain an entry for computing node G e.g. if none of the computing nodes have previously communicated with computing node G and the System Manager module does not push mapping information to the Communication Manager Module R without request if a prior entry in local store for computing node G has expired based on an associated expiration time etc. the Communication Manager module R interacts with System Manager module to obtain the corresponding actual physical substrate network address for computing node G on behalf of computing node A. In particular in this example the System Manager module maintains provisioning information that identifies where each computing node is actually located and to which entity and or managed virtual computer network the computing node belongs such as by initiating execution of programs on computing nodes for entities and virtual computer networks or by otherwise obtaining such provisioning information. As discussed in greater detail with respect to the System Manager module may determine whether the request from Communication Manager module R on behalf of computing node A for computing node G s actual physical substrate network address is valid including whether computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G e.g. such as based on being part of the same configured local area sub network and if so provides that actual physical substrate network address.

Communication Manager module R receives the actual physical substrate network address for computing node G from the System Manager module and stores this received information as part of an entry for computing node G as part of mapping information for later use optionally with an expiration time and or other information . In addition in this example Communication Manager module R determines a virtual hardware address to be used for computing node G e.g. by generating a dummy identifier that is locally unique for the computing nodes managed by Communication Manager module R stores that virtual hardware address in conjunction with the received actual physical substrate network address as part of the mapping information entry and provides the virtual hardware address to computing node A as part of response message . By maintaining such mapping information later communications from computing node A to computing node G may be authorized by Communication Manager module R without further interactions with the System Manager module based on the use of the virtual hardware address previously provided by Communication Manager module R. In some embodiments the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node G may not be a dummy address such as if System Manager module further maintains information about hardware addresses used by the various computing nodes e.g. virtual hardware addresses assigned to virtual machine computing nodes actual hardware addresses assigned to computing systems acting as computing nodes etc. and provides the hardware address used by computing node G to Communication Manager module R as part of the interactions . In such embodiments the Communication Manager module R may take further actions if computing nodes on different virtual networks use the same virtual hardware address such as to map each combination of computing node hardware address and managed virtual computer network to a corresponding substrate network address.

In other embodiments Communication Manager module R may interact with System Manager module to obtain a physical substrate network address for computing node G or otherwise determine such a physical substrate network address at times other than upon receiving an ARP request such as in response to any received communication that is directed to computing node G using the virtual network address 10.0.0.3 as part of entity Z s virtual computer network or if the System Manager module provides that information to Communication Manager module R without request e.g. periodically upon changes in the information etc. . Furthermore in other embodiments the virtual hardware addresses that are used may differ from this example such as if the virtual hardware addresses are specified by the System Manager module if the virtual hardware addresses are not random and instead store one or more types of information specific to the corresponding computing nodes etc. In addition in this example if computing node A had not been determined to be authorized to send communications to computing node G whether by the System Manager module and or Communication Manager module R Communication Manager module R would not send the response message with the virtual hardware address e.g. instead sends no response or an error message response .

In this example if the interconnection network is an IPv4 network the returned actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G in interactions may be for example 200.0.10.2 such as if the System Manager module and or the Communication Manager module S has selected that substrate network address to represent computing node G from the substrate network address range associated with Communication Manager module S thus a communication sent over the interconnection network to 200.0.10.2 will be routed to Communication Manager module S for handling. Alternatively if the interconnection network is an IP64 network the returned IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G in interactions may be 0B 02 10.0.0.3 where 10.0.0.3 is stored in the last 32 bits of the 128 bit IPv6 address and where is a 24 bit entity network identifier for computing node G corresponding to the managed virtual computer network for entity Z e.g. as previously assigned by the System Manager module to that network to reflect a random number or some other number corresponding to the entity . In this example the initial 72 bits of the IPv6 network address store the 0B 02 designation corresponding to the sub network or other portion of the physical interconnection network with a network address range of 0B 02 72 to which Communication Manager module S corresponds thus a communication sent over the interconnection network to IPv6 destination network address 0B 02 10.0.0.3 will similarly be routed to Communication Manager module S for handling. In other embodiments the entity network identifier may be other lengths e.g. 32 bits if Communication Manager module S has an associated network address range of 64 bits rather than 56 bits and or may have other forms e.g. may be random may store various types of information etc. and the remaining 56 bits used for the network address range after the 0B 02 designation may store other types of information e.g. an identifier for a particular entity a tag or label for the virtual computer network an identifier for a particular specified VLAN to which computing node G is assigned etc. . In addition some or all such information may instead be stored and or transmitted with a communication to computing node G in other manners in other embodiments such as by including the information in a header of the communication including in situations in which the substrate network uses the IPv4 networking protocol.

After receiving the response message from Communication Manager module R computing node A creates and initiates the sending of a communication to computing node G shown in as communication . In particular the header of communication includes a destination network address for destination computing node G that is 10.0.0.3 a destination hardware address for destination computing node G that is the virtual hardware address provided to computing node A in message a source network address for sending computing node A that is 10.0.0.2 and a source hardware address for sending computing node A that is an actual or dummy hardware address that was previously identified to computing node A e.g. by Communication Manager module R based on a configuration of computing node A etc. . Since computing node A believes that computing node G is part of the same local sub network as itself computing node A does not need to direct the communication to any intermediate logical router devices that are configured in a network topology for the managed virtual computer network to separate the computing nodes.

Communication Manager module R intercepts the communication modifies the communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication over the interconnection network to computing node G. In particular Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual destination network address and virtual destination hardware address for computing node G from the header and then retrieves the actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual destination hardware address from mapping information . As previously noted the actual physical substrate network address may be for example 200.0.10.2 or 0B 02 10.0.0.3 and Communication Manager module R creates a new IPv4 or IPv6 header for the encoded new communication depending on whether the interconnection network is an IPv4 or IPv6 network respectively that includes that actual physical substrate network address as the destination address. Similarly the Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual source network address and virtual source hardware address for computing node A from the header of the received communication obtains an actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual source hardware address e.g. from a stored entry in mapping information by interacting with the System Manager module to obtain that information if not previously obtained etc. and includes that actual physical substrate network address as the source network address for the new header of the new encoded communication. In this example the actual physical substrate network address for computing node A may be 200.0.0.1 if the interconnection network is an IPv4 network or 0A 01 10.0.0.2 if the interconnection network is an IPv6 network which if used in a reply by Communication Manager module S on behalf of computing node G will be routed to Communication Manager module R for forwarding to computing node A. The Communication Manager module R then creates communication by modifying communication so as to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new header e.g. in accordance with SIIT including populating the new header with other information as appropriate for the encoded modified communication e.g. payload length traffic class packet priority etc. . Thus the communication includes the same content or payload as communication without encapsulating the communication within the communication in this example. Furthermore access to the specific information within the payload is not needed for such reheadering such as to allow Communication Manager module R to handle communications in which the payload is encrypted without needing to decrypt that payload.

In at least some embodiments before forwarding communication to Communication Manager module S Communication Manager module R may perform one or more actions to determine that communication is authorized to be forwarded to computing node G as communication such as based on the mapping information including a valid entry for the destination virtual hardware address used in communication e.g. an entry specific to sending computing node in some embodiments or instead an entry corresponding to any of the computing nodes in other embodiments . In other embodiments such an authorization determination may not be performed by Communication Manager module R for each outgoing communication or instead may be performed in other manners e.g. based on a determination that the sending node and destination node are part of the same managed virtual computer network are associated with the same entity or are otherwise authorized to inter communicate based on an interaction with System Manager module to obtain an authorization determination for the communication etc. .

After Communication Manager module R forwards the modified communication to the interconnection network the interconnection network uses the physical destination substrate network address of the encoded communication to route the communication to Communication Manager module S. In doing so the devices of the interconnection network do not use information about the overlay virtual network addresses for computing nodes A or G or the entity network identifier for their virtual computer network and thus do not need any special configuration to forward such a communication nor even awareness that a managed virtual computer network is being overlaid on the physical interconnection network.

When Communication Manager module S receives communication via the interconnection network it performs actions similar to those of Communication Manager module R but in reverse. In particular in at least some embodiments the Communication Manager module S verifies that communication is legitimate and authorized to be forwarded to computing node G such as via one or more interactions with the System Manager module. If the communication is determined to be authorized or if the authorization determination is not performed the Communication Manager module S then modifies communication as appropriate and forwards the modified communication to computing node G. Additional details related to the verification of the communication are discussed with respect to .

In particular to modify communication Communication Manager module S retrieves information from mapping information that corresponds to computing node G including the virtual hardware address used by computing node G or generates such a virtual hardware address if not previously available such as for a new computing node . Communication Manager module S then creates communication by modifying communication so as to replace the prior header of the communication encoded for the substrate network with a new IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network e.g. in accordance with SIIT . The new IPv4 header includes the virtual network address and virtual hardware address for computing node G as the destination network address and destination hardware address for the new IPv4 header the virtual network address and a virtual hardware address for computing node A as the source network address and source hardware address for the new IPv4 header and includes other information as appropriate for the communication e.g. total length header checksum etc. . The virtual hardware address used by Communication Manager module S for computing node A may be the same as the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node A but in other embodiments each Communication Manager module may maintain separate hardware address information that is not related to the information used by the other Communication Manager modules e.g. if Communication Manager module S generated its own dummy virtual hardware address for computing node A in response to a prior ARP request from one of the computing nodes for computing node A s hardware address . Thus the communication includes the same content or payload as communications and . Communication Manager module S then provides communication to computing node G.

After receiving communication computing node G determines to send a response communication to computing node A using the source virtual network address and source virtual hardware address for computing node A from communication . Communication Manager module S receives response communication and processes it in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication and Communication Manager module R. In particular Communication Manager module S optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A e.g. based on being a response to a previous communication or otherwise based on configuration information for computing nodes A and G as previously described and then modifies communication to create communication by generating a new substrate network communication header using mapping information . After forwarding communication to the interconnection network the communication is sent to Communication Manager module R which processes the incoming communication in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication and Communication Manager module S. In particular Communication Manager module R optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A and that communication actually was sent from the substrate network location of computing node G and then modifies communication to create response communication by generating a new IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network using mapping information . Communication Manager module R then provides response communication to computing node A. In some embodiments and situations Communication Manager modules R and or S may handle response communications differently from initial communications such as to assume that response communications are authorized in at least some situations and to not perform some or all authorization activities for response communications in those situations.

In this manner computing nodes A and G may inter communicate using a IPv4 based managed virtual computer network without any special configuration of those computing nodes to handle the actual intervening one or more substrate networks and substrate interconnection network may forward communications encoded for it without any special configuration of any physical networking devices of the substrate interconnection network based on the Communication Manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network over the actual physical interconnection network.

In addition while not illustrated with respect to in at least some embodiments the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes. For example Communication Manager modules may take various actions to support broadcast and multicast capabilities for computing nodes that they manage including to optionally use various special reserved multicast group virtual network addresses. When a computing node sends a broadcast multicast communication any Communication Manager module with an associated computing node that has subscribed to that multicast broadcast group would be identified e.g. based on those Communication Manager modules having subscribed to the group such as in response to prior join communications sent by those associated computing nodes and the Communication Manager module for the sending computing node would forward the communication to each of the identified Communication Manager modules of the group for forwarding to their appropriate managed computing nodes. In addition in some embodiments and situations at least some broadcast or multicast communications may not be forwarded by Communication Manager modules such as communications with an IPv4 prefix of 224.0 16 or another designated prefix or other label or identifier. In addition to supporting broadcast and multicast capabilities for managed computing nodes the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes that correspond to configured network topologies for the virtual computer networks to which the computing nodes belong. For example computing nodes may send various requests that a specified local router device or other specified networking device would be expected to handle e.g. ping requests SNMP queries etc. and the associated Communication Manager modules may intercept such requests and take various corresponding actions to emulate the functionality that would have been provided by the specified networking device if it was physically implemented.

In addition it will be appreciated that a Communication Manager module may facilitate communications between multiple of the computing nodes that are associated with that Communication Manager module. For example with respect to computing node may wish to send an additional communication not shown to computing node . If so Communication Manager module R would perform actions similar to those previously described with respect to the handling of outgoing communication by Communication Manager module R and the handling of incoming communication by Communication Manager module S but without reheadering of the additional communication to use an header for the substrate network since the communication will not travel over the interconnection network. However if computing nodes and are configured in a network topology for the virtual computer network to be separated by one or more logical networking devices the Communication Manager module R may take additional actions to emulate the functionality of those logical networking devices.

While not illustrated with respect to in at least some embodiments other types of requests and communications may also be handled in various ways. For example in at least some embodiments an entity may have one or more computing nodes that are managed by Communication Manager module s and that are part of a managed virtual computer network for that entity and may further have one or more other non managed computing systems e.g. computing systems that are directly connected to the interconnection network and or that natively use the same network addressing protocol as that of the interconnection network that do not have an associated Communication Manager module that manages their communications. If the entity desires that those non managed computing systems be part of that virtual computer network or otherwise communicate with the managed computing nodes of the virtual computer network such communications between managed computing nodes and non managed computing systems may be handled by the Communication Manager module s that manage the one or more computing nodes in at least some such embodiments. For example in such situations if such a non managed computing system is provided with an actual destination substrate network address for such a managed computing node the non managed computing system may send communications to the associated Communication Manager module for that managed computing node via interconnection network using that destination substrate network address and that Communication Manager module would forward those communications to that computing node e.g. after reheadering the communications in a manner similar to that previously described if the Communication Manager module is configured to accept communications from that non managed computing system or from any non managed computing system . Furthermore the Communication Manager module may generate a dummy virtual network address to correspond to such a non managed computing system map it to the actual substrate network address for the non managed computing system and provide the dummy virtual network address to its managed computing node e.g. as the source address for the communications forwarded to the computing node from the non managed computing system thus allowing the computing node to send communications to the non managed computing system.

In addition as previously noted a communication manager module manages communications for associated computing nodes in various ways including in some embodiments by assigning virtual network addresses to computing nodes of a provided virtual computer network and or by assigning substrate physical network addresses to managed computing nodes from a range of substrate physical network addresses that correspond to the communication manager module. In other embodiments some such activities may instead be performed by one or more computing nodes of the virtual computer network such as to allow a DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server or other device of a virtual computer network to specify virtual network addresses for particular computing nodes of the virtual network. In such embodiments the communication manager module obtains such configuration information from the virtual computer network device s and updates its mapping information accordingly and in some embodiments may further update one or more system manager modules that maintain information about computing nodes associated with virtual networks . In yet other embodiments a user or other entity associated with a virtual computer network may directly configure particular computing nodes to use particular virtual network addresses. If so the communication manager modules and or system manager module may track which virtual network addresses are used by particular computing nodes and similarly update stored mapping information accordingly.

After the System Manager module determines that computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G e.g. based on having the same entity network identifier based on computing node A having an entity network identifier that is authorized to communicate with computing nodes of the entity network identifier for computing node G based on other information provided by or associated with computing node A indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications based on information provided by or associated with computing node G indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications etc. the System Manager module returns a response message that includes the desired actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G. In addition in at least some embodiments before sending the desired actual physical network address the System Manager module may further verify that Communication Manager module R is authorized to send the message on behalf of computing node A such as based on computing node A being determined to be one of the computing nodes to which Communication Manager module R is associated.

In other embodiments Communication Manager module R may perform some or all of the actions described as being performed by System Manager module such as to maintain provisioning information for the various computing nodes and or to determine whether computing node A is authorized to send communications to computing node G or instead no such authorization determination may be performed in some or all situations. Furthermore in other embodiments other types of authorization determinations may be performed for a communication between two or more computing nodes such as based on one or more criteria associated with the communication e.g. a type of the communication a size of the communication a time of the communication etc. .

As previously noted with respect to after Communication Manager module S receives communication intended for computing node G via the interconnection network Communication Manager module S may perform one or more interactions with the System Manager module in order to determine whether to authorize that communication. In particular in this example to verify that the communication is valid and authorized to be forwarded to computing node G Communication Manager module S first extracts information from the encoded communication that indicates the overlay virtual computer network source and destination virtual network addresses for computing nodes A and G and optionally the entity network identifier s for those computing nodes e.g. from header fields in the encoded communication or by extracting embedded information in the actual destination substrate network address and actual source substrate network address of the encoded communication . The Communication Manager module S next exchanges messages with System Manager module to obtain the corresponding actual substrate physical network address for the sending computing node A on behalf of computing node G including a message that includes the extracted virtual network addresses for computing nodes A and G in the overlay virtual computer network as well as the entity network identifier for each of the computing nodes. In at least some embodiments Communication Manager module S may send message to the System Manager module using an anycast addressing and routing scheme as previously described.

The System Manager module receives message and returns a response message that includes the actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node A e.g. 200.0.0.1 or 0A 01 10.0.0.2 . As previously discussed with respect to messages and in some embodiments the System Manager module and or Communication Manager module S may further perform one or more other types of authorization determination activities such as to determine that computing node G is authorized to communicate with computing node A that Communication Manager module S is authorized to send the message on behalf of computing node G etc. Communication Manager module S then verifies that the returned physical substrate network address in response message matches the source substrate network address used to send the encoded communication over the substrate network so as to prevent attempts to spoof messages as being from computing node A that are actually sent from other computing nodes in other locations. Communication Manager module S optionally stores this received information from response message as part of an entry for computing node A in mapping information for later use along with computing node A s virtual network address and a virtual hardware address for computing node A.

In this example computing nodes A and C Communication Manager module R System Manager module interconnection network and Translation Manager Module N are co located at one or more first locations e.g. at a single data center and computing node A has initiated sending one or more communications to external device E which is located external to the substrate network used at the first location s . For the purposes of this example the Translation Manager Module N manages communications sent between the first location and external device E including to modify outgoing communications that are encoded for and forwarded over the substrate network to Translation Manager Module N by decoding the communications and removing any substrate specific information as well as optionally adding one or more types of information specific to the virtual computer network. The Translation Manager Module N may further provide a variety of types of other functionality in at least some embodiments as described in greater detail elsewhere. In this example Translation Manager Module N is associated with the IPv4 substrate network address of 200.0.10.5 to which outgoing communications from the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network destined for external device E are initially forwarded over the substrate network.

In particular in this example computing node A determines to send a communication to external computing node E and accordingly sends outgoing communication in a manner similar to that described with respect to for outgoing communication . While not illustrated in computing node A may optionally have previously exchanged one or more other messages with Communication Manager module R to determine a hardware address to use to represent external device E for the virtual computer network e.g. in a manner similar to that described with respect to for communications and . Thus in this example the outgoing communication sent by source computing node A includes a destination virtual network address of 10.0.0.5 for the intended final destination of external device E a source virtual network address of 10.0.0.2 for computing node A and source and destination hardware addresses used to represent computing node A and external device E respectively e.g. a virtual hardware address used to represent external computing node E that was previously provided to computing node A by Communication Manager module R .

The outgoing overlay virtual computer network communication is intercepted and handled by Communication Manager module R in a manner similar to that described in for communication including to modify the overlay virtual computer network communication to encode it for the substrate network as appropriate and to forward the modified encoded communication over the interconnection network toward its intended final destination of external device E . The Communication Manager module R may store various substrate network address information as part of mapping information as discussed in greater detail with respect to B and E and if so may already have stored substrate network address information for use with communications from computing node A to external device E. If not however the Communication Manager module R determines that the intended final destination for the outgoing communication is associated with Translation Manager module R of the substrate network optionally by performing one or more current or prior interactions with the System Manager module . In particular the Communication Manager module R may have previously performed one or more interactions with the System Manager module to determine a substrate network address to use for that indicated destination virtual network address e.g. as part of an ARP request for external device E s virtual network address of 10.0.0.5 or the Communication Manager module R may alternatively perform one or more such interactions with the System Manager module at a time of receiving outgoing communication if those interactions were not previously performed.

As part of the interactions the System Manager module determines that the indicated virtual network address of 10.0.0.5 for external device E corresponds to a target network node external to the substrate network e.g. based on use of the provisioning information and or network topology information . Accordingly the System Manager module determines that a communication to the indicated virtual network address is to be forwarded using the Translation Manager Module N as an intermediate destination and selects the substrate network address specific to the Translation Manager Module N as being the substrate network address for Communication Manager module R to use for communications from computing node A to external device E. For example Translation Manager Module N and its substrate network address may be associated with a sub range or other subset of the virtual network addresses for the managed virtual computer network as may be reflected in the mapping information based on corresponding information from the network topology information in such a case any communication destined for a virtual network address within that particular sub range or other subset will be forwarded over the substrate network to the Translation Manager Module N as an intermediate destination that will handle further forwarding of the communication. In this example the System Manager module uses the IPv4 substrate network address 200.0.10.5 of Translation Manager Module N for communications from computing node A to external device E. It will be appreciated that there may be one or more associated translation manager modules in the substrate network to manage communications sent between the external device E and multiple computing nodes in other embodiments and selection of a particular associated translation manager module for a particular communication between particular nodes may be performed in various manners e.g. based at least in part on the source node s virtual address and or on the destination node s virtual address . It will also be appreciated that in other embodiments some or all of the operations described above as being performed by the System Manager module may instead be performed by the Communication Manager module R.

Once the particular substrate network address of the Translation Manager Module N is selected for use with one or more communications from computing node A to external device E the Communication Manager module R stores that information as part of mapping information such as in a manner similar to that described with respect to mapping information in e.g. by modifying prior mapping information of . As discussed in greater detail previously the Communication Manager module R and or the System Manager module may further perform various optional authentication activities to verify that communications from computing node A to external device E are authorized. Thus with respect to intercepted outgoing overlay virtual computer network communication Communication Manager module R identifies the physical substrate network address corresponding to Translation Manager Module N that is to be used for the communication and creates a modified communication that is encoded for the substrate network . In a manner similar to that described previously the encoded communication has a new substrate network communication header that includes the physical substrate network address for Translation Manager Module N as the destination network address and that includes computing node A s substrate network address as the source network address. The encoded communication is then forwarded over the interconnection network directly to Translation Manager Module N based on the destination network address included in the encoded communication.

When Translation Manager Module N receives communication via the interconnection network it performs actions similar to those described in with respect to Communication Manager module S for communication . Such actions may include decoding the communication such as by using stored mapping information and or performing communications with the System Manager Module to retrieve information for use in replacing the substrate network header of the communication with a new communication header that corresponds to the type of external connection to the external device E. In this example external device E is accessible via an associated publicly routable external network address via one or more intervening external networks and the new communication header added by Translation Manager Module N indicates the destination external public network address of the intended final destination which in this example is external network address 20.0.5.3 for external device E. The new communication header may similarly include a source network address that represents source computing node A to external nodes e.g. a publicly routable network address and or port associated with Translation Manager Module N that is uses to represent computing node A such as if the Translation Manager Module N performs NAT PAT functionality for computing nodes at the first location . The Translation Manager Module N may instead or also optionally add network identifying information for the managed virtual computer network e.g. an identifier for a particular entity a tag or label for the virtual computer network an identifier for a particular specified VLAN to which external device E is assigned etc. to the communication before it is forwarded from Translation Manager module N towards external device E. The Translation Manager Module N then forwards the modified communication as communication over one or more external networks between the substrate network and the external device E. While not illustrated here in other embodiments the Translation Manager Module N may further be configured to optionally perform additional interactions with the System Manager module before forwarding the received communication such as to determine if the communication is authorized and to block or otherwise filter the communication if so to update mapping information used by the Translation Manager Module N to determine the network address to use for the final destination to perform metering of a quantity of communications handled by the Translation Manager Module N destined for and or forwarded to external device E to enforce a maximum rate or maximum quantity or other threshold of use of external device E e.g. based on a capacity of external device E and or of one or more parts of the intervening networks or other external connection to external device E and or based on configuration information specified by entity Z for the managed virtual computer network or by another external entity who controls external device E etc.

When external device E sends a communication to a particular computing node of the virtual network in the present example a response to the communication from computing node A the communication is directed over the external network s to and handled by the Translation Manager Module N such as based on Translation Manager Module N being one of one or more edge devices or other modules for the substrate network that are configured to receive communications sent to particular network addresses for the location of the substrate network. In particular the Translation Manager Module N receives the incoming communication optionally verifies that external device E is authorized to send communications to computing node A e.g. based on being a response to a previous communication or otherwise based on configuration information for external device E and computing node A and then modifies communication to create communication . For example Translation Manager Module N may encode the incoming communication for forwarding over the substrate network by generating a new substrate network communication header using mapping information such as to specify a destination substrate network address corresponding to computing node A e.g. the substrate network address 200.0.0.1 corresponding to Communication Manager module R or one of a range of multiple substrate network addresses associated with Communication Manager module R . After forwarding encoded communication to the interconnection network the communication is forwarded to Communication Manager module R which processes the incoming communication in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication and Communication Manager module R in . In particular Communication Manager module R optionally verifies that external device E is authorized to send communications to computing node A and then decodes to remove information specific to the substrate network and optionally further encodes the communication in a manner specific to the virtual computer network such as by modifying communication to create communication by generating a new IPv4 header for the overlay virtual computer network using mapping information . Communication Manager module R then provides communication to computing node A such as via shared memory a private link or other connection etc. In some embodiments and situations Communication Manager modules R and or Translation Manager Module N may handle response communications differently from initial communications such as to assume that response communications are authorized in at least some situations and to not perform some or all authorization activities for response communications in those situations.

In this manner the CNS system may provide functionality corresponding to the integration of external devices and other external network nodes into the virtual computer network without any special configuration of the computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network or of the substrate network physical networking devices or of the external network nodes based on the Communication Manager modules and Translation Manager module s overlaying the virtual computer network on the actual substrate interconnection network in such a manner as to provide the desired functionality. Various other types of actions than those discussed with respect to may be performed in other embodiments including for types of network addressing protocols other than IPv4 and or IPv6.

In particular in this example mapping information used by the Communication Manager module R includes information for each entry that includes the following a virtual computer network identifier which in this example is a network identifier corresponding to the overlay virtual computer network provided for entity Z a source computing node interface identifier which in this example includes an A to correspond to the single logical network interface for computing node A a destination virtual network address identifier an associated destination substrate network address and optionally various other information . The optional other information may include for example a destination hardware address provided to associated computing nodes for use in representing particular destination computing nodes information about expiration times or other use criteria for particular entries etc.

Thus in the example of when computing node A initiates the sending of a communication to external device E via the Communication Manager module R the sent communication includes the destination virtual network address of 10.0.0.5 for external device E. In the entry provides a match for the indicated destination virtual network address with the associated substrate network address for entry in this example being 200.0.10.5 for Translation Manager Module N to which the communication will be initially directed. Thus entry will be used for communications sent from computing node A to external device E. If a range of multiple virtual network addresses were associated with one or more external network nodes that include external device E the information in column of entry or of another entry for those one or more external network nodes may instead have a form such as 10.0.0.4 30 to correspond to any virtual network addresses from 10.0.0.4 to 10.0.0.7 which may all be mapped to the substrate network address of Translation Manager Module N or may instead correspond to multiple different translation manager modules not shown which may be used to manage such communications.

The example mapping information used by the Translation Manager Module N includes information similar to that displayed for mapping information and in particular includes information for each of its entries that includes the following a virtual computer network identifier which in this example is a network identifier corresponding to the overlay virtual computer network provided for entity Z a source network interface identifier e.g. in this example if Translation Manager Module N is configured with a U network interface facing the external network s and a V network interface facing the substrate interconnection network a destination virtual network address identifier information related to a type of encoding and corresponding information for an external connection to the external network node e.g. in the example of an associated destination substrate or external network address corresponding to external device E and optionally various other information . For example in some embodiments and situations a particular entry may indicate for a particular external connection to use a particular VLAN identifier or MPLS label. Accordingly in this example when the Translation Manager Module N receives the communication from computing node A that is intended for external device E the received communication includes the destination virtual network address of 10.0.0.5 for external device E. In this example the entry provides a match for the indicated destination virtual network address and the information for the entry will indicate to use a publicly routable external network address in this example the external network address of 20.0.5.3 which Translation Manager Module N will use to direct the further forwarded outgoing communication to external device E. Thus entry will be used for communications sent from computing node A to external device E. As with mapping information if a range of multiple virtual network addresses were associated with one or more external network nodes that include external device E the information in column of entry or of another entry for those one or more external network nodes may instead have a form such as 10.0.0.4 30 to correspond to any virtual network addresses from 10.0.0.4 to 10.0.0.7 which may all be mapped to a single external location such as with a single external network address to use a single VLAN identifier to use etc.

In this manner the CNS system may provide functionality that supports the use of one or more translation manager modules within a substrate network without any special configuration of the other computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network or of the physical networking devices of the substrate network or of the devices external to substrate interconnection network based on communication manager modules and translation manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network on the actual physical interconnection network in such a manner as to provide the desired functionality including to support network nodes external to the substrate network as being part of the virtual computer network.

Thus if one of the computing nodes in the logical subnet A of the provided overlay virtual computer network sends a communication to one of the external network nodes of logical subnet C which are at one or more locations external to the substrate network the sent communication will be directed via the substrate network to one or more Translation Manager modules that facilitate the connection between the substrate network and one or more external connections. If the interconnections in the logical network topology include one or more intermediate network nodes the communication may first be directed to those intermediate network nodes via the substrate network before the communication is forwarded to the one or more Translation Manager modules such as to enable the one or more intermediate network nodes to perform one or more of various types of configured handling of such communications e.g. firewall related activities VPN related activities etc. . When the communication is received by a Translation Manager module it will perform activities to forward the communication on to the indicated destination external network node of logical subnet C in a manner similar to that previously described. For example if computing node A initiates the sending of a communication to external network node M the sent communication includes the destination virtual network address of 10.2.4.1 for external device M. In this example there may be an entry in the mapping information of Communication Manager Module R having 10.2.4.0 29 as the destination virtual network address identifier which may be selected as providing the best match for the indicated destination virtual network address based on the use of longest prefix matching to select the entry that matches the destination network address and has the longest number of matching bits that are specified. If Translation Manager Module N of is used to managing the communications to the external network nodes of logical subnet C the associated destination substrate network address for the particular entry would be 200.0.10.5 causing the communication from computing node A to be initially forwarded to Translation Manager Module N which will further forward the communication on towards its final destination using the associated external network address of 30.0.8.2 . Thus the particular described routing entry in mapping information will be used for communications sent from computing node A to external network node M and more generally to any external network node of logical subnet C assuming that the external network nodes of logical subnet C all have virtual network addresses between 10.2.4.0 and 10.2.4.7 . Similarly the Translation Manager Module N may have an entry in the mapping information with 10.2.4.1 as the destination virtual network address identifier and the associated destination public external network address of 30.0.8.2 which Translation Manager Module N will use for communications sent from any of the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network to external network node M.

Various other types of actions than those discussed with respect to may be performed in other embodiments including for types of network addressing protocols other than IPv4 and or IPv6.

In some embodiments one or more modules of the configurable network service may further be configured to perform one or more additional types of functionality in at least some situations such as by the multiple translation manager modules in a distributed manner optionally in conjunction with multiple communication manager modules and or the system manager module. As one example the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to perform metering or other tracking of the use of one or more external network nodes for a managed virtual computer network and to provide information about such tracking for various purposes e.g. to enable fees to be charged to a client associated with the managed virtual computer network if the corresponding tracked activities are fee based activities to provide information to a client associated with the managed virtual computer network and or to another entity regarding an amount of use of one or more intermediate destination computing nodes such as to enable corresponding monitoring activities etc. . As another example the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to filter at least some communications forwarded to and or from one or more external network nodes of a managed virtual computer network including to limit the rate or total quantity of such communications to be below a specified or determined threshold of use such rate quantity limiting or other filtering may be configured in various manners such as based on configuration information received by a client associated with the managed virtual computer network e.g. to limit use of a fee based feature of the managed virtual computer network to correspond to limitations of the one or more external network nodes and or of other nodes or networking components associated with the external network nodes etc. based on a capacity or other aspects of a particular external network node etc. The one or more modules may further be configured to filter communications received from one or more external network nodes of a managed virtual computer network in at least some embodiments such as to ensure that the communications are authorized for or otherwise allowed for the managed virtual computer network before those communications are provided to one of the computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network. In addition the one or more modules may be configured in at least some embodiments to perform signaling activities if the unavailability of a particular external network node is detected e.g. based on the external network node failing or on an external connection to the external network node being unavailable and as may be detected based on a lack of response or other information from the external network node for a period of time or to one or more forwarded communications or other messages such as to notify other computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network of the unavailability to inhibit future communications from being forwarded to the external network node while it is unavailable as well as to optionally perform other related activities e.g. to initiate providing a replacement for the unavailable external network node .

In addition as previously noted configuration information that is specified for a virtual computer network may include various network topology information various computing nodes may be selected for the virtual computer network and configured in accordance with the network topology in various manners and various network nodes external to the substrate network may be integrated into the virtual computer network in accordance with the network topology in various manners.

In addition in some situations a communication manager module tracks or otherwise determines the virtual computer networks to which the module s associated computing nodes belong e.g. based on entities on whose behalf the virtual computer networks operate as part of managing the communications for the virtual computer networks and a translation manager module may similarly track or otherwise determines the one or more virtual computer networks to which the module s associated external network nodes belong as part of managing the communications sent to and or from those external network nodes. The determination by a communication manager module of a corresponding virtual computer network for an associated computing node and or the determination by a translation manager module of a corresponding virtual computer network for an associated external network node may be performed in various ways in various embodiments such as by interacting with a system manager module that provides that information by tracking software modules or other programs executing on such computing nodes by tracking entities associated with such computing nodes etc. For example when a particular computing node begins to execute one or more software programs on behalf of a user and that user also has other software programs executing on other computing nodes the new computing node executing the user s program s may be selected to be associated with a virtual computer network for the user that includes those other computing nodes. Alternatively a user or other entity may specify a particular managed computer network to which a computing node belongs such as if the entity maintains multiple distinct managed computer networks between different groups of computing nodes. In addition in at least some embodiments one or more system manager modules of the CNS system may facilitate configuring communications between computing nodes such as by tracking and or managing which computing nodes belong to which virtual computer networks e.g. based on executing programs on behalf of a customer or other entity by tracking and or managing which external network nodes operate as logical nodes of which virtual computer networks and by providing information about actual substrate network addresses or actual public external network addresses that correspond to virtual network addresses used for a particular virtual computer network e.g. by a particular customer or other entity .

In addition as previously noted configuration information that is specified for a virtual computer network may include various network topology information and various computing nodes devices and other external network nodes in various locations external to the substrate network may be selected for the virtual computer network and configured in accordance with the network topology in various manners. For example in some embodiments the selection of a computing node to be used in a managed virtual computer network and or to be assigned a particular role in a configured network topology may be based at least in part on a geographical and or network location of the computing node such as an absolute location or instead a location relative to one or more other computing resources of interest e.g. other computing nodes of the same managed virtual computer network storage resources to be used by the computing node etc. such as within a minimum and or maximum specified geographical distance or other degree of proximity to an indicated other computing resource or other location. In addition in some embodiments factors used when selecting a computing node may be not be based on location such as to include one or more of the following constraints related to capabilities of a computing node such as resource related criteria e.g. an amount of memory an amount of processor usage an amount of network bandwidth and or an amount of disk space and or specialized capabilities available only on a subset of available computing nodes e.g. database services and storage constraints related to costs such as based on fees or operating costs associated with use of particular computing nodes etc.

As previously noted in some embodiments a program execution service executes third party customers programs using multiple physical computing systems e.g. in one or more data centers that each host multiple virtual machines with each virtual machine being able to execute one or more programs for a customer. In some such embodiments customers may provide programs to be executed to the program execution service and may reserve execution time and other resources on physical or virtual hardware facilities provided by the program execution service. In addition customers and or the program execution service may define virtual computer networks that will be used by the program execution service for computing nodes of the customer so as to transparently provide computing nodes of a virtual computer network including network nodes located remote from the substrate network with the appearance of operating on a dedicated physical network.

The computing system includes a CPU various I O components storage and memory . The I O components include a display network connection computer readable media drive and other I O devices e.g. a mouse keyboard speakers etc. .

The host computing system operates to host one or more virtual machines such as for use as computing nodes in managed virtual computer networks e.g. computing nodes that execute programs on behalf of various users . The host computing system includes a CPU various I O components storage and memory . While not illustrated here the I O components may include similar components to those of I O components . A virtual machine Communication Manager module and one or more virtual machines are executing in the memory with the module managing communications for the associated virtual machine computing nodes and in some embodiments including various software instructions that when executed program the CPU to provide the described functionality. The Communication Manager module maintains various mapping information on storage related to the computing nodes and other computing nodes such as in a manner similar to mapping information and of . The structure of the other host computing systems may be similar to that of host computing system or instead some or all of the host computing systems and may act directly as computing nodes by executing programs without using hosted virtual machines. In a typical arrangement the group may include hundreds or thousands of host computing systems such as those illustrated here organized into a large number of distinct physical sub networks and or networks.

An embodiment of a CNS system is executing in memory of the computing system . In some embodiments the system may receive an indication of multiple computing nodes to be used as part of a managed virtual computer network e.g. one or more virtual machine computing nodes on host computing system or one or more computing nodes using one of the host computing systems and in some situations may select the particular computing node s for the managed virtual computer network. In some cases information about the structure and or membership of various managed virtual computer networks may be stored in the provisioning database on storage by the system and provided to the Communication Manager modules at various times. Similarly in some cases information about configured network topology to be emulated for one or more managed virtual computer networks including information about any integrated external network nodes may be stored in the database on storage by the system such as in a manner similar to information of and used to provide corresponding information to the Communication Manager modules at various times. In this example the system in memory includes a system manager module and optionally other modules with the communication manager modules and being a further part of the distributed CNS system in this example. The system module performs operations to facilitate the use of external network nodes for managed computer networks as discussed elsewhere. In addition the CNS system and the modules and may each in some embodiments include various software instructions that when executed program the CPU to provide described functionality.

As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the Communication Manager modules and and other Communication Manager modules not shown that manage other associated computing nodes not shown and the various modules and of the system may interact in various ways to manage communications between computing nodes including to support the integration of particular external network nodes into particular provided virtual computer networks and or to use particular alternative intermediate destinations for particular communications from computing nodes of provided virtual computer networks. Such interactions may for example enable the computing nodes and or other computing nodes to inter communicate over managed virtual computer networks without any special configuration of the computing nodes by overlaying the virtual computer networks over network and optionally one or more external networks not shown without any special configuration of networking device or other networking devices not shown and without encapsulation of communications.

In addition the functionality provided by the illustrated modules may in some embodiments be combined in fewer modules or distributed in additional modules such as if the functionality of a system manager module and one or more communication manager modules are instead combined into a single module. Similarly in some embodiments the functionality of some of the illustrated modules may not be provided and or other additional functionality may be available. Furthermore in some embodiments alternative intermediate destinations of one or more types other than edge devices may be present and in use e.g. one or more translation manager modules whether as part of instead of or in addition to the alternative edge devices .

It will also be appreciated that while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them may be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and or systems may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing systems via inter computer communication.

Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where a request is received. The routine continues to block to determine the type of request. If it is determined that the type of request is to associate one or more computing nodes and or external network with a particular managed virtual computer network provided for an indicated entity such as if those nodes are executing or are to execute one or more programs on behalf of that entity or are otherwise designed or configured to provide one or more desired types of functionality for that entity the routine continues to block to associate those nodes with that indicated entity and virtual computer network. In some embodiments the routine may further determine one or more computing nodes to be associated with the indicated entity and virtual computer network such as based on information provided by the indicated entity while in other embodiments the selection of such computing nodes and or execution of appropriate programs on those computing nodes may be performed in other ways. In addition as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments one or more of the computing nodes may each be a virtual machine that is hosted by one or more physical computing systems and the external network nodes may have various forms in various embodiments and situations. In addition in some embodiments the routine may obtain and store various types of configuration information for the virtual computer network such as a range of virtual network addresses for use with the virtual computer network a specified network topology for the virtual computer network etc. The routine then continues to block to store mapping information for the nodes and the managed virtual computer network including any received configuration information. For example in the illustrated embodiment the routine stores for each node an indication of a substrate or external network address corresponding to the node a virtual network address used by the entity for the node as part of the virtual computer network optionally a virtual hardware address assigned to the computing node an indication of the associated entity optionally information about a logical location and or function of the computing node in the specified network topology etc. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the substrate network address or external network address corresponding to a node may in some embodiments be a network address specific to that single node while in other embodiments may instead refer to a sub network or other group of multiple nodes such as may be managed by an associated Communication Manager module and or Translation Manager module. After block the routine continues to block to optionally provide information about the node s and their configuration to one or more communication manager modules and or one or more translation manager modules associated with those nodes although in other embodiments instead provides such information upon request from the communication manager modules and or translation manager modules.

If it is instead determined in block that the type of received request is a request for address resolution for a virtual network address of a target node or other computer system of interest such as from a communication manager module or translation manager module on behalf of a managed node the routine continues instead to block where it determines whether the request is authorized in one or more ways such as based on whether the managed node on whose behalf the request is made is authorized to send communications to a target node whose virtual network address resolution is requested e.g. based on the virtual computer network s to which the two nodes belong based on whether the managed node on whose behalf the request is made is a valid node that is currently part of a configured virtual computer network and or based on whether the request is received from the communication manager module or translation manager module that actually manages the indicated node on whose behalf the request is made. If the request is determined to be authorized the routine continues to block where it obtains a network address of interest for a particular target node of interest such as may be included with the request received in block or previously stored and currently identifiable for the target based on other received information. The routine then continues to block to retrieve stored information for the target that is associated with the network address and in particular to retrieve information that associates that target network address to a substrate network address or external network address for a network location that corresponds to the target such as may be previously stored with respect to block and optionally to other information for the target network address e.g. an associated virtual hardware address an indication regarding whether the target network address corresponds to a physically implemented computing node with an actual substrate network address or instead to a logical networking device that does not have an actual substrate network address information about a role or status of the device corresponding to the virtual network address with respect to configured network topology information whether the target network address is external to a current location such that communications to the target will use one or more intermediate destination edge devices and or translation manager modules whether communications to the target network address will use one or more intermediate computing node destinations or other intermediate destinations that are not edge devices or translation manager modules etc. . After block the routine continues to to provide an indication of the retrieved information to the requester. While not illustrated here if the determination in block determines that the request is not authorized the routine may instead not perform blocks for that request such as by responding with an error message to the request received in block or by not responding to that received request. In addition in other embodiments the routine may perform one or more other tests to validate a received request before responding with the requested information such as to verify that the node that initiated the request is authorized to receive that information. Furthermore in the illustrated embodiment communication manager modules perform operations to select particular intermediate destinations to use for particular communications including in some situations a particular translation manager module when multiple such translation manager modules are available for use such as in an individualized manner for each of at least some communications although in other embodiments the routine may instead perform some or all such actions e.g. as part of block and if a single alternative intermediate destination may be repeatedly used for multiple communications being a single source final destination pair .

If it is instead determined in block that the received request is of another type the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example in some embodiments the routine may receive requests to update stored information about particular nodes such as if a particular node was previously associated with a particular entity and or virtual computer network but that association ends e.g. one or more programs being executed for that entity on that node are terminated the node fails or otherwise becomes unavailable an associated user or other client changes specified configuration information for the node etc. . Similarly in some embodiments the routine may receive requests to update stored information about external network nodes or otherwise about specified network topology for a virtual computer network including to add remove or configure translation manager modules in some situations and optionally to provide such updated information to one or more communication manager modules of the provided virtual network. The routine may also perform a variety of other actions related to managing a system of multiple nodes as discussed in greater detail elsewhere and may at times perform actions of other types such as to perform occasional housekeeping operations to review and update stored information as appropriate e.g. after predefined periods of time have expired . In addition if possible validation problems are detected such as with respect to received address resolution requests for virtual network addresses the routine may take various actions to signal an error and or perform other corresponding actions as appropriate.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

The routine begins at block where an indication is received of a node communication or other message. The routine continues to block to determine the type of communication or other message and proceed accordingly. If it is determined in block that the message is a request from an associated managed computing node for network address resolution such as an ARP request the routine continues to block to identify the target network address of interest indicated in the request. The routine then continues to block to send a request to a system manager module for network address resolution for the indicated target network address for the virtual computer network that is associated with the computing node that provided the request such as discussed with respect to blocks of . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the routine may in some embodiments track information about virtual computer networks and or entities associated with each managed computing node as well as one or more external network nodes that are each part of one or more virtual computer networks while in other embodiments at least some such information may instead be provided to the routine by the computing nodes and or by the system manager module or instead the system manager module may track and store that information without it being provided to and tracked by the current routine. While not illustrated here in other embodiments and situations such address resolution requests may be handled in other manners. For example if a computing node being managed by a particular communication manager module provides an address resolution request for another computing node that is also managed by that communication manager module the routine may instead respond to the request without interaction with the system manager module such as based on locally stored information. In addition while in the illustrated embodiment the received request is a request to provide a computing node s link layer hardware address that corresponds to an indicated networking layer address in other embodiments the address resolution request may have other forms or computing nodes may request other types of information about computing nodes that have indicated target network addresses.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine next continues to block to receive a response from the system manager module that includes a substrate network address and or other information corresponding to the identified virtual network address e.g. an indication that the target address is an external address and stores information locally that maps that substrate network address and or other information to a unique hardware address for later use by the routine e.g. based on a dummy virtual hardware address generated by the routine or provided in the response along with other information about the target destination as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. The routine then provides the hardware address to the requesting computing node which it may use as part of one or more later communications that it sends to the target destination with the indicated target network address. The routine then continues to block to determine if blocks were performed as part of the handling of an outgoing node communication as discussed with respect to blocks and if so continues to block . While not illustrated here in some embodiments the routine may instead receive an error response from the system manager module e.g. based on the requesting computing node not being authorized to communicate with the indicated destination node or no response and if so may not send any response to the requesting computing node or may send a corresponding error message to that computing node.

If it is instead determined in block that the type of communication or other message is an outgoing node communication from a computing node managed by the routine to another indicated non local target destination that is not a computing node also managed by the routine the routine continues to block to identify the indicated hardware address for the indicated target final destination from the communication header. In block the routine then determines whether that destination hardware address is a hardware address previously mapped to a substrate network address corresponding to the final destination such as previously discussed with respect to block . If not in some embodiments the routine continues to block to perform blocks to determine such a corresponding substrate network address for the outgoing node communication while in other embodiments such actions are not performed e.g. if the indicated hardware address is not a mapped address the routine may cause the outgoing node communication to fail such as with an error message back to the sending node if the indicated hardware address is not mapped but the destination network address is an external address of an external computer system that is not part of the virtual computer network to proceed to perform blocks to send the communication to an edge device for forwarding to an external network etc. .

If the indicated hardware address is a mapped address or the check is not performed the routine continues to block to retrieve the physical substrate network address that is mapped to the hardware address. In block the routine then rewrites the communication header in accordance with a networking address protocol for one or more intermediate substrate networks between the sending computing node and destination using the substrate network address retrieved in block . The header rewriting may further include changing other information in the new header including changing a virtual network address for the sending computing node to be a corresponding substrate network address and in at least some embodiments includes modifying the received communication without encapsulation as part of an overlay of the virtual computer network over the one or more intermediate substrate networks. Furthermore for a communication whose destination hardware address does correspond to a logical networking device the routine in block may further perform other modifications that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by the one or more logical networking devices that would be used to forward the communication to the destination in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. In block the routine then facilitates providing of the modified outgoing communication to the destination such as by initiating forwarding of the modified outgoing communication over the substrate intermediate network s toward the destination. While not illustrated here in other embodiments various additional types of processing may be performed for outgoing node communications such as to verify that the communications are valid or otherwise authorized in various ways e.g. to verify that the sending computing node is authorized to send communications to the destination such as based on being associated with the same entity or part of the same virtual computer network based on the sending computing node and destination being associated with different entities that are authorized to inter communicate based on the type of communication or other information specific to the communication etc. . In some embodiments there may be multiple alternative intermediate destinations for use in forwarding a communication to a final destination such as multiple translation manager modules for use in exchanging communications between multiple computing nodes and one or more external network nodes. In the illustrated embodiment in such situations the system manager module selects a particular such alternative intermediate destination to use such as may be identified by the current routine with respect to information received in block . Maintaining the use of a single such alternative intermediate destination between a pair of sending destination nodes may provide various benefits including to enable continuity for a particular flow of communications or other group of multiple communications back and forth between two nodes. In other embodiments the selection of such a particular intermediate destination to use for a particular communication may be made in other manners including by the routine e.g. with respect to block and optionally in a dynamic manner for some or all such communications. For example the routine may instead receive in block a list or other indication of multiple substrate network addresses corresponding to some or all of the multiple alternative intermediate destinations and may then use that information as part of selecting a particular intermediate destination to use in a particular situation as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

If it is instead determined in block that the received message is an incoming node communication for one of the managed computing nodes from a non local node managed by a different communication manager module or by a translation manager module the routine continues instead to block to identify the substrate network addresses for the sender and for the destination computing node from the communication header. After block the routine continues to block to optionally verify that the incoming communication is valid in one or more ways. For example the routine may determine whether the substrate network address for the sender is actually mapped to a node that corresponds to the location from where the communication entered the substrate network such as based on interactions with a system manager module and or based on other information previously obtained and stored by the routine. In addition the routine may determine whether the substrate network address for the destination computing node corresponds to an actual managed computing node. While not illustrated here if an incoming communication is determined to not be valid the routine may take various actions not shown such as to generate one or more errors and perform associated processing and or drop the incoming communication without forwarding it to the indicated destination node. For example if the incoming communication indicates a destination network address that does not correspond to a current managed computing node the routine may drop the incoming communication and or initiate an error message although in some embodiments such error messages are not sent to the sending computing node.

In the illustrated embodiment after block the routine continues to block to retrieve the hardware address and the virtual network address that are mapped to the destination substrate network address and to rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent to a computing node with that virtual network address and hardware address. For example in some embodiments the destination virtual network address may be obtained from the destination substrate network address itself such as from a subset of the bits of the destination substrate network address. In addition the destination hardware address may have previously been mapped to the destination substrate network address such as previously discussed with respect to block . In situations in which such prior mapping has not occurred the routine may instead perform blocks to obtain such information although such actions are not illustrated in this example. The routine may similarly rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent from a node with a source virtual network address corresponding to the sender. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the routine in block may further perform other modifications to the incoming communication that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by one or more logical networking devices that would have been used to forward the communication to the destination computing node in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. After block the routine continues to block to facilitate providing of the modified incoming communication to the destination computing node such as by initiating forwarding of the modified incoming communication to the destination computing node.

If it is instead determined in block that a message of another type is received the routine continues to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate such as to store information about entities associated with particular computing nodes store configuration information about translation manager modules or other intermediate destinations store current or recent tracking information about intermediate destinations e.g. current load information for particular intermediate destinations or other information about current characteristics of particular intermediate destinations store information about external network nodes and other configured network topologies for particular virtual computer networks respond to requests and other messages from computing nodes in a manner to provide logical networking functionality corresponding to configured network topologies for virtual computer networks e.g. by emulating actions and other functionalities that would be performed by specified logical networking devices if they were physically implemented update previously mapped or stored information to reflect changes with respect to computing nodes that are being managed or to non local nodes perform operations to forward communications between multiple managed computing nodes of the communication manager module without forwarding such communications over the substrate network etc. The storing and or updating of stored information may be initiated in various manners such as by receiving information in response to previous requests periodically requesting such information receiving information that is proactively pushed to the routine without a corresponding request etc.

After blocks or or if it is instead determined in block that the processing is not being performed with respect to an outgoing communication the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

The routine begins at block where an indication is received of a node communication or other message. The routine continues to block to determine the type of communication or other message and to proceed accordingly.

If it is determined in block that the type of communication or other message is an node communication from the substrate network that is directed to an external network node the routine continues to block to identify from the communication the indicated virtual network address for the sender and the virtual network address for the intended final destination external network node. The routine then continues to block to retrieve information mapped to the destination virtual network address that indicates how to encode communications sent to that destination virtual network address over an external connection. In block the routine then rewrites the communication header in accordance with the retrieved information e.g. based on a networking address protocol for the external connection based on an external network address for the external network node etc. including optionally changing other information in the new header e.g. changing the source network address to another network address and or port used to represent the sending computing node to external computer systems such as if the routine performs NAT PAT functionality for computing nodes of the virtual computer network adding network identifying information for the managed virtual computer network etc. and in at least some embodiments includes modifying the received communication without encapsulation as part of an overlay of the virtual computer network over the one or more external networks. In block the routine then facilitates providing of the modified outgoing communication to the destination external network node such as by initiating forwarding of the modified outgoing communication to the external network s for forwarding to the destination network node. While not illustrated here the routine may further take actions in some embodiments to perform operations related to metering a quantity of communications that are forwarded by the routine to one or more external network nodes related to filtering particular communications sent to one or more external network nodes related to determining and or enforcing limits on rates or quantities or other thresholds of use for communications to one or more external nodes etc.

If it is instead determined in block that the received message is an incoming communication from a network external to the substrate network for a computing node of a virtual computer network overlaid on the substrate network the routine continues to block to identify the source and destination network addresses from the communication header as well as to optionally identify a particular virtual computer network to which the destination computing node belongs based on network identifying information e.g. a VLAN identifier included with the communication. After block the routine continues to block to retrieve the mapped destination substrate network address for the destination network address as well as a source substrate network address for the translation manager module. After block the routine continues to block to optionally verify that the incoming communication is valid in one or more ways such as based on interactions with a system manager module and or based on other information previously obtained and stored by the routine regarding the sending node and or destination node. While not illustrated here if an incoming communication is determined to not be valid the routine may take various actions not shown such as to generate one or more errors and perform associated processing and or drop the incoming communication without forwarding it to the indicated destination node. In the illustrated embodiment after block the routine continues to block to encode the communication for the substrate network by rewriting the communication header using the destination and source substrate network addresses. In block the routine removes any network identifying information for the virtual computer network to the communication e.g. identifiers for a particular entity a tag or label for the virtual computer network such as a VLAN identifier for a particular VLAN associated with the destination virtual computer network etc. . In block the routine then facilitates providing of the modified outgoing communication to the destination computing node such as by initiating forwarding of the modified communication to the substrate network for further forwarding to the destination computing node. While not illustrated here the routine may further take actions in some embodiments to perform operations related to metering a quantity of communications that are forwarded by the routine from one or more external network nodes related to filtering particular communications sent by one or more external network nodes related to determining and or enforcing limits on rates or quantities or other thresholds of use for communications from one or more external nodes etc.

If it is instead determined in block that a message of another type is received the routine continues to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate such as to store information about entities associated with particular external network nodes store information about external network nodes and other configured network topologies for particular virtual computer networks update previously mapped or stored information to reflect changes with respect to external network nodes that are being managed or to other computing nodes forward communications between computing nodes and external computer systems that are not part of any virtual computer networks perform configuration or reporting related to actions taken to meter a quantity of communications that are forwarded by the routine to one or more external network nodes or taken to filter particular communications or taken to determine and or store information about a threshold of use of particular external nodes etc. The storing and or updating of stored information may be initiated in various manners such as by receiving information in response to previous requests periodically requesting such information receiving information that is proactively pushed to the routine without a corresponding request etc.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.
