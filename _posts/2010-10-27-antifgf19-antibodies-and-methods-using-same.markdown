The techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are generally well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art such as for example the widely utilized methodologies described in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3rd. edition 2001 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. 2003 the series METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY Academic Press Inc. PCR 2 A PRACTICAL APPROACH M. J. MacPherson B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. 1995 Harlow and Lane eds. 1988 ANTIBODIES A LABORATORY MANUAL and ANIMAL CELL CULTURE R. I. Freshney ed. 1987 .

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The phrase substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50 preferably less than about 40 preferably less than about 30 preferably less than about 20 preferably less than about 10 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 ug ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 ul well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10Msby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881. However if the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs alpha anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

 Oligonucleotide as used herein generally refers to short generally single stranded generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally but not necessarily less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.

The term FGF19 interchangeably termed Fibroblast growth factor 19 as used herein refers unless specifically or contextually indicated otherwise to any native or variant whether native or synthetic FGF19 polypeptide. The term native sequence specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. The term wild type FGF19 generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGF19 protein. The term wild type FGF19 sequence generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring FGF19.

The term FGFR4 interchangeably termed Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 as used herein refers unless specifically or contextually indicated otherwise to any native or variant whether native or synthetic FGFR4 polypeptide. The term native sequence specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. The term wild type FGFR4 generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGFR4 protein. The term wild type FGFR4 sequence generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring FGFR4.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies for e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two chain Fv species this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these can be further divided into subclasses isotypes IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.

Hypervariable regions may comprise extended hypervariable regions as follows 24 36 LI 46 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the VL and 26 35 Hi 49 65 or 50 to 65 H2 and 93 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fe typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

 Chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins have a portion of the heavy and or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Humanized antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. Bio Technology 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci USA 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. Gene 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. J. Immunol. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al J. Mol.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 or Presta U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see review M. in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulates homeostasis of immunoglobulins.

Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie 1997 Hinton 2004 . Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 and WO99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

The term wasting disorders e.g. wasting syndrome cachexia sarcopenia refers to a disorder caused by undesirable and or unhealthy loss of weight or loss of body cell mass. In the elderly as well as in AIDS and cancer patients wasting disease can result in undesired loss of body weight including both the fat and the fat free compartments. Wasting diseases can be the result of inadequate intake of food and or metabolic changes related to illness and or the aging process. Cancer patients and AIDS patients as well as patients following extensive surgery or having chronic infections immunologic diseases hyperthyroidism Crohn s disease psychogenic disease chronic heart failure or other severe trauma frequently suffer from wasting disease which is sometimes also referred to as cachexia a metabolic and sometimes an eating disorder. Cachexia is additionally characterized by hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism. Although cachexia and wasting disease are frequently used interchangeably to refer to wasting conditions there is at least one body of research which differentiates cachexia from wasting syndrome as a loss of fat free mass and particularly body cell mass Mayer 1999 J. Nutr. 129 1S Suppl. 256S 259S . Sarcopenia yet another such disorder which can affect the aging individual is typically characterized by loss of muscle mass. End stage wasting disease as described above can develop in individuals suffering from either cachexia or sarcopenia.

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell such as a cell expressing FGF19 either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells such as a cell expressing FGF19 in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

 Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is 8S cis 10 3 amino 2 3 6 trideoxy L lyxo hexapyranosyl oxy 7 8 9 10 tetrahydro 6 8 11 trihydroxy 8 hydroxyacetyl 1 methoxy 5 12 naphthacenedione.

The term Fc region comprising polypeptide refers to a polypeptide such as an antibody or immunoadhesin see definitions below which comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.

This invention encompasses compositions including pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti FGF19 antibody and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding an anti FGF19 antibody. As used herein compositions comprise one or more antibodies that bind to FGF19 and or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies that bind to FGF19. These compositions may further comprise suitable carriers such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers which are well known in the art.

The invention also encompasses isolated antibody and polynucleotide embodiments. The invention also encompasses substantially pure antibody and polynucleotide embodiments.

The anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention are preferably monoclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are Fab Fab Fab SH and F ab fragments of the anti FGF19 antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric or humanized. These fragments are useful for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes set forth below.

Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.

The anti FGF19 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to FGF19 generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of FGF19 and an adjuvant. FGF19 may be prepared using methods well known in the art some of which are further described herein. For example recombinant production of FGF19 is described below. In one embodiment animals are immunized with a derivative of FGF19 that contains the extracellular domain ECD of FGF19 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In one embodiment animals are immunized with an FGF19 IgG1 fusion protein. Animals ordinarily are immunized against immunogenic conjugates or derivatives of FGF19 with monophosphoryl lipid A MPL trehalose dicrynomycolate TDM Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc. Hamilton Mont. and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti FGF19 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.

Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against FGF19. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay MA or enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti FGF I9 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3.

The antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones .

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti FGF19 clones is desired the subject is immunized with FGF19 to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti human FGF19 clones is obtained by generating an anti human FGF19 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that FGF19 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against FGF19. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for anti FGF19 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing FGF19 specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation with FGF19 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled FGF19 followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which FGF19 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. . 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al . 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . Preferably the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et el. 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity Kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 published 14 Mar. 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10M range.

Nucleic acid sequence encoding an FGF19 can be designed using the amino acid sequence of the desired region of FGF19. Alternatively the cDNA sequence or fragments thereof may be used. Additional FGF19 sequences are further disclosed in e.g. NM022963 and Xie et al. 1999 Cytokine 11 729 735. DNAs encodin FGF19 can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al. 28 716 734 1989 such as the triester phosphite phosphoramidite and H phosphonate methods. In one embodiment codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the FGF19 encoding DNA. Alternatively DNA encoding FGF19 can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.

Following construction of the DNA molecule encoding FGF19 the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector such as a plasmid wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Suitable vectors for expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and some are further described herein. Eukaryotic organisms such as yeasts or cells derived from multicellular organisms such as mammals may be used.

Optionally the DNA encoding FGF19 is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII ecotin lamB herpes GD lpp alkaline phosphatase invertase and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A Abrahmsen et al. 4 3901 1985 .

Host cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaPOprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell. Methods for transfection are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. Methods for transformation are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Prokaryotic host cells used to produce FGF19 can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook et al. supra.

The mammalian host cells used to produce FGF19 can be cultured in a variety of media which is well known in the art and some of which is described herein.

The host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in in vitro culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.

The purified FGF19 can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads acrylamide beads glass beads cellulose various acrylic copolymers hydroxyl methacrylate gels polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers nylon neutral and ionic carriers and the like for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the FGF19 protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in vol. 44 1976 . A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices e.g. agarose dextran or cellulose involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand s primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.

Alternatively FGF19 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other art known method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized FGF19 under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or by FGF19 antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1 000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for FGF19. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting FGF19 rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated FGF19 but with the biotinylated FGF19 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for FGF19. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics. Anti FGF19 clones may also be activity selected.

DNA encoding the hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In a preferred embodiment a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for all human full or partial length heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding anti FGF19 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See Antibody Engineering ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Human anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by CDR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or CDR residues of non human origin.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal preferably human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case one of the binding specificities is for FGF19 and the other is for any other antigen. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the FGF19 protein. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express FGF19. These antibodies possess an FGF19 binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different and more preferred approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human. T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et at 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fe region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 n VD2 X2 n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 Science 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. Such altering includes deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.

Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 Presta L. . See also US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. See also WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. on antigen binding molecules with modified glycosylation.

The preferred glycosylation variant herein comprises an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibodies include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 .

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions . If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine. In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. J. Immunol. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. J. Immunol. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc reg on with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymers are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

The antibodies of the invention bind FGF19 and in some embodiments may modulate one or more aspects of FGF19 associated effects including but not limited to FGFR4 activation FGFR4 downstream molecular signaling disruption of FGFR4 binding to FGF19 FGFR4 multimerization expression of a CYP7 1 gene phosphorylation of FGFR4 MAPK FRS2 and or ERK2 activation of catenin FGF19 promoted cell migration and or disruption of any biologically relevant FGF19 and or FGFR4 biological pathway and or treatment and or prevention of a tumor cell proliferative disorder or a cancer and or treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with FGF19 expression and or activity such as increased FGF19 expression and or activity .

The purified antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays. Illustrative antigen binding assay are provided below in the Examples section.

In some embodiments the invention provides anti FGF19 monoclonal antibodies that compete with an antibody comprising a light chain variable domain having the sequence DIKMTQSPSSMYASLGERVTIPCKASQDINSFLSWFQQKPGKSPKTLIYRANRLVDGVPSRFSGSGSGQDYSL TISSLEYEDMGIYYCLQYDEFPLTFGAGTKVEIKR SEQ ID NO 4 and a heavy chain variable domain having the sequence QVQLKQSGPGLVQPSQSLSITCTVSGFSLTTYGVHWVRQSPGKGLEWLGVIWPGGGTDYNAAFISRLSITKD NSKSQVFFKMNSLLANDTAIYFCVRKEYANLYAMDYWGQGTLLTVSA SEQ ID NO 8 for binding to FGF19. Such competitor antibodies include antibodies that recognize an FGF19 epitope that is the same as or overlaps with the FGF19 epitope recognized by the antibody. Such competitor antibodies can be obtained by screening anti FGF19 hybridoma supernatants for binding to immobilized FGF19 in competition with labeled antibody comprising a light chain variable domain having the sequence DIKMTQSPSSMYASLGERVTIPCKASQDINSFLSWFQQKPGKSPKTLIYRANRLVDGVPSRFSGSGSGQDYSL TISSLEYEDMGIYYCLQYDEFPLTFGAGTKVEIKR SEQ ID NO 4 and a heavy chain variable domain having the sequence QVQLKQSGPGLVQPSQSLSITCTVSGFSLTTYGVHWVRQSPGKGLEWLGVIWPGGGTDYNAAFISRLSITKD NSKSQVFFKMNSLLANDTAIYFCVRKEYANLYAMDYWGQGTLLTVSA SEQ ID NO 8 . A hybridoma supernatant containing competitor antibody will reduce the amount of bound labeled antibody detected in the subject competition binding mixture as compared to the amount of bound labeled antibody detected in a control binding mixture containing irrelevant or no antibody. Any of the competition binding assays described herein are suitable for use in the foregoing procedure.

Anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention possessing the properties described herein can be obtained by screening anti FGF19 hybridoma clones for the desired properties by any convenient method. For example if an anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody that blocks or does not block the binding of FGFR4 to FGF19 is desired the candidate antibody can be tested in a binding competition assay. Competition assays are well known in the art and one such assay is described in the Examples.

Other functional assays to determine the inhibitory capacity of anti FGF19 antibodies are known in the art some of which are exemplified herein.

In some embodiments the present invention contemplates altered antibodies that possess some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fe activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fe receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed. FeRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.

In some embodiments the invention provides altered antibodies that possess increased effector functions and or increased half life.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM.TM. 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene 159 203 1995 .

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann Cellular and Molecular Biology vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 karat U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 . Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. J. Immunol. Methods 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an OD550 of about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 J Bio Chem 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Patent No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Patent No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 Mol. Microbiol. 39 199 210.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. Microbial Drug Resistance 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies where relevant or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 .

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv Nature 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody polypeptide encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. J. Gen Virol. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather Biol.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. Meth. Enz. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. Anal. Biochem. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. EMBO J. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably termed antibody drug conjugates or ADC comprising any of the anti FGF19 antibodies described herein conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Drg Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad.

The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein eg. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC 1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B 1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schr oder and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 588 Pettit et al 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863. See also Doronina 2003 Nat Biotechnol 21 7 778 784 Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser.

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lod et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAN PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

Therapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 20th edition 2000 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 20th edition 2000 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

The invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. Relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies e.g. cancer therapies such as chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery hormonal therapy and or biological therapy immunotherapy anti VEGF antibody therapy particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer is not clinically adequate to treat the patients or the patients are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these patients need additional effective therapy. As used herein the phrase can also refer to a condition of the non responsive refractory patient e.g. which describe patients who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects develop resistance do not respond to the therapy do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy etc. In various embodiments a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased or tumor size has not been significantly reduced or has increased or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells using the art accepted meanings of relapse or refractory or non responsive in such a context. A tumor resistant to anti VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.

The invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in a subject by administering one or more anti FGF19 antibody to block or reduce the relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in subject. In certain embodiments the antagonist can be administered subsequent to the cancer therapeutic. In certain embodiments the anti FGF19 antibody is administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively or additionally the anti FGF19 antibody therapy alternates with another cancer therapy which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in patients predisposed to having cancer. Generally the subject was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti angiogenesis agent e.g. a VEGF antagonist. The anti angiogenesis agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment the anti angiogenesis agent is an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment e.g. humanized A4.6.1 AVASTIN Genentech South San Francisco Calif. Y0317 M4 G6 B20 2C3 etc. . See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 582 959 6 884 879 6 703 020 WO98 45332 WO 96 30046 WO94 10202 EP 0666868B1 US Patent Applications 20030206899 20030190317 20030203409 and 20050112126 Popkov et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 288 149 164 2004 and WO2005012359. Additional agents can be administered in combination with VEGF antagonist and an anti FGF19 antibody for blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth.

The antibodies of the invention and adjunct therapeutic agent is are administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibodies are suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The antibody composition of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with other agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

For example a biological sample may be assayed for FGF19 by obtaining the sample from a desired source admixing the sample with anti FGF19 antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody FGF19 complex with any FGF19 present in the mixture and detecting any antibody FGF19 complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody FGF19 complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include immunohistochemistry competitive and sandwich assays and steric inhibition assays. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. Examples of samples include but are not limited to cancer cells such as colon breast prostate ovary lung stomach pancreas lymphoma and leukemia cancer cells. FGF19 may also be measured in serum. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology 3edition 1960 Lee G. Luna HT ASCP Editor The Blakston Division McGraw Hill Book Company New York 1994 Ulreka V. Mikel Editor Armed Forces Institute of Pathology American Registry of Pathology Washington D.C. . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used. By way of example neutral buffered formalin Bouin s or paraformaldehyde may be used to fix a sample. Generally the sample is first fixed and is then dehydrated through an ascending series of alcohols infiltrated and embedded with paraffin or other sectioning media so that the tissue sample may be sectioned. Alternatively one may section the tissue and fix the sections obtained. By way of example the tissue sample may be embedded and processed in paraffin by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Examples of paraffin that may be used include but are not limited to Paraplast Broloid and Tissuemay. Once the tissue sample is embedded the sample may be sectioned by a microtome or the like See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . By way of example for this procedure sections may range from about three microns to about five microns in thickness. Once sectioned the sections may be attached to slides by several standard methods. Examples of slide adhesives include but are not limited to silane gelatin poly L lysine and the like. By way of example the paraffin embedded sections may be attached to positively charged slides and or slides coated with poly L lysine. If paraffin has been used as the embedding material the tissue sections are generally deparaffinized and rehydrated to water. The tissue sections may be deparaffinized by several conventional standard methodologies. For example xylenes and a gradually descending series of alcohols may be used See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Alternatively commercially available deparaffinizing non organic agents such as Hemo De7 CMS Houston Tex. may be used.

Analytical methods for FGF19 all use one or more of the following reagents labeled FGF19 analogue immobilized FGF19 analogue labeled anti FGF19 antibody immobilized anti FGF19 antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as tracers. 

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of FGF19 and anti FGF19 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected.

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of FGF19 and anti FGF19 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophtalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides bis imidates bis diazotized benzidine and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above described fluorescent chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 940 475 fluorimetry and 3 645 090 enzymes Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1021 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 230 1981 and Nygren 30 407 412 1982 . Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label including the enzymes to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See for example O Sullivan et al. Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay in ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis Vol. 73 Academic Press New York N.Y. 1981 pp. 147 166.

Immobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti FGF19 antibody from any FGF19 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti FGF19 antibody or FGF19 analogue before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti FGF19 antibody or FGF19 analogue afterward e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

The expression of proteins in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry IHC techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens in situ generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used.

IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay binding of antibody to the target antigen e.g. FGF19 is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme labeled primary antibody which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.

The primary and or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories 

Aside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above further treatment of the tissue section prior to during or following IHC may be desired For example epitope retrieval methods such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out see e.g. Leong et al. 4 3 201 1996 .

Following an optional blocking step the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably the label is an enzymatic label e.g. HRPO which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3 3 diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody e.g. the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti rabbit antibody .

Specimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined e.g. using a microscope and staining intensity criteria routinely used in the art may be employed.

Other assay methods known as competitive or sandwich assays are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.

Competitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer FGF19 analogue to compete with the test sample FGF19 for a limited number of anti FGF19 antibody antigen binding sites. The anti FGF19 antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and FGF19 bound to the anti FGF19 antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and FGF19. This separation is accomplished by decanting where the binding partner was preinsolubilized or by centrifuging where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction . The amount of test sample FGF19 is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose response curves with known amounts of FGF19 are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of FGF19 present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.

Another species of competitive assay called a homogeneous assay does not require a phase separation. Here a conjugate of an enzyme with the FGF19 is prepared and used such that when anti FGF19 antibody binds to the FGF19 the presence of the anti FGF19 antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case the FGF19 or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti FGF19 antibody so that binding of the anti FGF19 antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method per se is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.

Steric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low molecular weight hapten to a small FGF19 fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti FGF19 antibody. Under this assay procedure the FGF19 present in the test sample will bind anti FGF19 antibody thereby allowing anti hapten to bind the conjugate resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten e.g. a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.

Sandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of FGF19 or anti FGF19 antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti FGF19 antibody is used to adsorb test sample FGF19 the test sample is removed as by washing the bound FGF19 is used to adsorb a second labeled anti FGF19 antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample FGF19. In simultaneous sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti FGF19. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti FGF19 antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for FGF19.

The foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for FGF19. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti FGF19 antibody for the determination of FGF19 are included within the scope hereof including the bioassays described herein.

In one aspect the invention provides methods to detect e.g. presence or absence of or amount a polynucleotide s e.g. FGF19 polynucleotides in a biological sample from an individual such as a human subject. A variety of methods for detecting polynucleotides can be employed and include for example RT PCR taqman amplification methods polynucleotide microarray and the like.

Methods for the detection of polynucleotides such as mRNA are well known and include for example hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes such as in situ hybridization using labeled FGF19 riboprobes Northern blot and related techniques and various nucleic acid amplification assays such as RT PCR using complementary primers specific for FGF19 and other amplification type detection methods such as for example branched DNA SPIA Ribo SPIA SISBA TMA and the like .

Biological samples from mammals can be conveniently assayed for e.g. FGF19 mRNAs using Northern dot blot or PCR analysis. For example RT PCR assays such as quantitative PCR assays are well known in the art. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention a method for detecting FGF19 mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer amplifying the cDNA so produced using an FGF19 polynucleotide as sense and antisense primers to amplify FGF19 cDNAs therein and detecting the presence or absence of the amplified FGF19 cDNA. In addition such methods can include one or more steps that allow one to determine the amount levels of FGF19 mRNA in a biological sample e.g. by simultaneously examining the levels a comparative control mRNA sequence of a housekeeping gene such as an actin family member . Optionally the sequence of the amplified FGF19 cDNA can be determined.

Probes and or primers may be labeled with a detectable marker such as for example a radioisotope fluorescent compound bioluminescent compound a chemiluminescent compound metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers can be used to detect the presence of FGF19 polynucleotides in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing FGF19 proteins. As will be understood by the skilled artisan a great many different primers and probes may be prepared e.g. based on the sequences provided in herein and used effectively to amplify clone and or determine the presence or absence of and or amount of FGF19 mRNAs.

Optional methods of the invention include protocols comprising detection of polynucleotides such as FGF19 polynucleotide in a tissue or cell sample using microarray technologies. For example using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes that have potential to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. Differential gene expression analysis of disease tissue can provide valuable information. Microarray technology utilizes nucleic acid hybridization techniques and computing technology to evaluate the mRNA expression profile of thousands of genes within a single experiment. see e.g. WO 01 75166 published Oct. 11 2001 See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 637 U.S. Pat. No. 5 445 934 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 522 Lockart Nature Biotechnology 14 1675 1680 1996 Cheung V. G. et al. Nature Genetics 21 Suppl 15 19 1999 for a discussion of array fabrication . DNA microarrays are miniature arrays containing gene fragments that are either synthesized directly onto or spotted onto glass or other substrates. Thousands of genes are usually represented in a single array. A typical microarray experiment involves the following steps 1. preparation of fluorescently labeled target from RNA isolated from the sample 2. hybridization of the labeled target to the microarray 3. washing staining and scanning of the array 4. analysis of the scanned image and 5. generation of gene expression profiles. Currently two main types of DNA microarrays are being used oligonucleotide usually 25 to 70 mers arrays and gene expression arrays containing PCR products prepared from cDNAs. In forming an array oligonucleotides can be either prefabricated and spotted to the surface or directly synthesized on to the surface in situ .

The Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercially available microarray system which comprises arrays fabricated by direct synthesis of oligonucleotides on a glass surface. Probe Gene Arrays Oligonucleotides usually 25 mers are directly synthesized onto a glass wafer by a combination of semiconductor based photolithography and solid phase chemical synthesis technologies. Each array contains up to 400 000 different oligos and each oligo is present in millions of copies. Since oligonucleotide probes are synthesized in known locations on the array the hybridization patterns and signal intensities can be interpreted in terms of gene identity and relative expression levels by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. Each gene is represented on the array by a series of different oligonucleotide probes. Each probe pair consists of a perfect match oligonucleotide and a mismatch oligonucleotide. The perfect match probe has a sequence exactly complimentary to the particular gene and thus measures the expression of the gene. The mismatch probe differs from the perfect match probe by a single base substitution at the center base position disturbing the binding of the target gene transcript. This helps to determine the background and nonspecific hybridization that contributes to the signal measured for the perfect match oligo. The Microarray Suite software subtracts the hybridization intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect match probes to determine the absolute or specific intensity value for each probe set. Probes are chosen based on current information from GenBank and other nucleotide repositories. The sequences are believed to recognize unique regions of the 3 end of the gene. A GeneChip Hybridization Oven rotisserie oven is used to carry out the hybridization of up to 64 arrays at one time. The fluidics station performs washing and staining of the probe arrays. It is completely automated and contains four modules with each module holding one probe array. Each module is controlled independently through Microarray Suite software using preprogrammed fluidics protocols. The scanner is a confocal laser fluorescence scanner which measures fluorescence intensity emitted by the labeled cRNA bound to the probe arrays. The computer workstation with Microarray Suite software controls the fluidics station and the scanner. Microarray Suite software can control up to eight fluidics stations using preprogrammed hybridization wash and stain protocols for the probe array. The software also acquires and converts hybridization intensity data into a presence absence call for each gene using appropriate algorithms. Finally the software detects changes in gene expression between experiments by comparison analysis and formats the output into .txt files which can be used with other software programs for further data analysis.

In some embodiments FGF19 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification is detected. Gene deletion gene mutation or amplification may be measured by any one of a wide variety of protocols known in the art for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization e.g. FISH using an appropriately labeled probe cytogenetic methods or comparative genomic hybridization CGH using an appropriately labeled probe. In addition these methods may be employed to detect FGF19 ligand gene deletion ligand mutation or gene amplification. As used herein detecting FGF19 expression encompasses detection of FGF19 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification.

Additionally one can examine the methylation status of the FGF19 gene in a tissue or cell sample. Aberrant demethylation and or hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene 5 regulatory regions frequently occurs in immortalized and transformed cells and can result in altered expression of various genes. A variety of assays for examining methylation status of a gene are well known in the art. For example one can utilize in Southern hybridization approaches methylation sensitive restriction enzymes which cannot cleave sequences that contain methylated CpG sites to assess the methylation status of CpG islands. In addition MSP methylation specific PCR can rapidly profile the methylation status of all the CpG sites present in a CpG island of a given gene. This procedure involves initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite which will convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracil followed by amplification using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. Protocols involving methylation interference can also be found for example in Current Protocols In Molecular Biology Unit 12 Frederick M. Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 De Marzo et al. Am. J. Pathol. 155 6 1985 1992 1999 Brooks et al Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prey. 1998 7 531 536 and Lethe et al. Int. J. Cancer 76 6 903 908 1998 . As used herein detecting FGF19 expression encompasses detection of FGF19 gene methylation.

Alternatively a single slide may be prepared from the tissue or cell sample and antibodies directed to FGF19 and FGFR4 may be used in connection with a multi color staining protocol to allow visualization and detection of the FGF19 and FGFR4.

Three days after the final boost spleens were harvested and popliteal lymph node cells were fused with murine myeloma cells P3 63Ag8.U.1 ATCC CRL1597 using 35 polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected in HAT medium. Ten days after the fusion hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for mAbs binding to the hu FGF 19 by ELISA. Cell lines producing antibodies against human FGF 19 were cloned twice by limiting dilution. Selected FGF19 antibody producing hybridomas were subcloned twice to insure monoclonality. The clones were inoculated for ascites production and antibodies were purified by protein A agarose affinity chromatography.

Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells producing the antibodies using standard methods. The variable light VL and variable heavy VH domains were amplified using RT PCR with the degenerate primers to heavy and light chain. The forward primers were specific for the N terminal amino acid sequence of the VL and VH region. Respectively the LC and HC reverse primers were designed to anneal to a region in the constant light CL and constant heavy domain 1 CH1 which is highly conserved across species. Amplified VL and VH were cloned into mammalian expression vectors. The polynucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined using routine sequencing methods.

For binding kinetics Surface Plasmon Resonance SRP measurement with a BIAcore 3000 was used BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. .

Triplicate sets of data were averaged for each condition.

HEP3B cells starved overnight in serum free media were treated with 40 ng ml FGF19 for 10 mM in the presence or the absence of antibodies. Cells were lysed in R27A buffer Upstate supplemented with 10 mM NaF 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and Complete protease inhibitor tablet Roche . Lysates were prepared electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blot using phospho FRS2 phospho MAPK and MAPK specific antibodies Cell Signaling and FRS2 specific antibody Santa Cruz .

Membranes were stripped Pierce and reprobed with appropriate antibodies to determine total protein.

Liver tumors were identified by micro ct imaging with Fenestra LC a liver specific contrast agent. Fenestra LC is an iodinated triglyceride that mimics chylomicron remnants and exploits endogenous lipid metabolic pathways resulting in hepatocyte contrast accumulation. These agents have been previously been previously employed as means to identify hepatic liver tumors. Lee et al. 1997 Weichert et al. 1996 At 6 months of age FGF19 transgenic mice were injected with Fenestra LC Advanced Research Technologies Inc. Saint Laurent Quebec Canada 20 l g iv and a conscious 3 hour hepatic uptake was allowed before mice were euthanized and livers resected for gross analysis weighing ex vivo micro CT analysis CT 40 system Scanco Medical Bassersdorf Switzerland and histological staining. Whole livers were lightly blotted on gauze and submerged in soybean oil Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. in preparation for micro CT imaging. For each liver 90 minute scans were obtained at 30 m isotropic voxel size with 512 projections at an integration time of 300 ms energy of 45 keV and tube current of 177 A. Volumetric image files were analyzed using image analysis software from AnalyzeDirect Lenexa Kans. . An intensity threshold of 16 Houndsfield Units HU was used to segment the tissue mass from the background signal soybean oil . A second threshold 26 HU was employed to estimate hepatic tissue volumes associated with functional hepatic tissue that accumulated the contrast agent resulting in hyper intense regions defining normal hepatic tissue. Hepatic tissues of FGF19 transgenic mice where there was minimal attenuation due to small contrast agent concentrations including vasculature gall bladder and biliary ducts and hepatocellular carcinomatous lesions appeared less intense. An average of the total low intensity hepatic volumes from wild type FVB mice which did not have hepatocellular carcinomas was subtracted from both the FGF19 transgenic control and treated groups to obtain volumes associated only with tumors. Data are expressed as a percentage of tumor volume of total liver volume.

HCT116 cells ATCC Rockville Md. were routinely maintained at 37 C. and 5 CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10 tetracycline free fetal bovine serum and 4 mmol L L glutamine. Serum starved cells were incubated with either vehicle or FGF19 25 100 ng ml 10 min . In separate experiments cells were treated with either control antibody gp120 or FGF19 antibody 1A6 10 g ml for 3 24 hrs. To further evaluate the effects on catenin activation pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 Biomol Plymouth Meeting Pa. at 1 M concentration for 4 hr followed by anti FGF19 mab 1A6 treatment for 24 hrs to evaluate phosphorylation of Ser33 Ser 37 Ser 45 and Ts41 on catenin. After incubation cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed for either protein or RNA analysis.

Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 IGEPAL 1 mM EDTA 0.25 sodium deoxycholate 1 mM NaF 1 mM NaVO protease inhibitors cocktail Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent Pierce Rockford Ill. . Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with specific antibody immobilized onto protein A Sepharose Sigma Aldrich for 2 hours at 4 C. with gentle rotation. Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and immunecomplexes were eluted in 2 Laemmli buffer boiled and microcentrifuged. Proteins were resolved on SDS PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific primary antibodies. After washing and incubating with secondary antibodies immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL detection system Amersham Arlington Ht. Ill. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were anti catenin mAbs from BD Transduction San Diego Calif. anti active catenin antibody directed against N terminally dephosphorylated catenin anti phosphotyrosine 4G10 and anti E cadherin antibody from UpState Biotech Charlottesville Va. anti phospho catenin Ser33 Ser37 and Ser45 Thr41 specific antibody from Cell Signaling Danvers Mass. and anti FGFR4 mAb 1G7 Genentech Inc. . Where indicated the membranes were stripped Pierce and reprobed with another antibody. The densities of specific protein bands were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop cs2 version 9 Adobe Systems Mountain View Calif. . Quantitative analyses of tyrosine and Ser Thr phosphorylation of catenin and E cadherin were performed by determining the ratio between total protein and the phosphorylation by using the data from three separate experiments.

Indirect quantification of N terminal catenin phosphorylation levels was performed using linear ion trap mass spectrometry. catenin was immunoprecipitated from cells pretreated with MG132 followed by treatment with control gp120 or anti FGF19 mab 1A6 and separated using Tris Gly SDS PAGE. Gels were Coomassie stained and the catenin bands were cut out and reduced in 10 mM DTT for 30 min room temperature and cysteines were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide 15 min at room temperature before tryptic digestion. The peptides were digested in trypsin 10 ng l in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 8.0 and peptide mixtures 3 mL were loaded onto a 0.25 30 mm trapping cartridge packed with Vydac 214MS low TFA C4 beads. This cartridge was placed in line with a 0.1 100 mm resolving column packed with Vydac 218MS C18 beads. The resolving column was constructed using a picofrit New Objective fused silica capillary pulled to a 15 mm metal coated tip which formed a micro electrospray emitter. Peptides were eluted with 1 hour gradients of acetonitrile containing 0.1 formic acid at a rate of 0.3 mL min. Data dependent tandem mass spectrometry was performed using a linear ion trap instrument LTQ Finnigan . The Sequest database searching program was used to generate cross correlation scores for each CID spectrum. Proteins matched by only a single peptide were confirmed by manual interpretation of the collision induced dissociation spectra. Phosphorylated peptides were manually confirmed. Peak areas were then integrated to determine relative abundance of peptides.

Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit Qiagen CA and DNase treated Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. following the manufacturer s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using ND 1000 spectrophotometer Wilmington Del. . Real time quantitative PCR was performed to determine the relative abundance of Wnt target gene cyclin D1 CD44 E cadherin c jun mRNAs. Probes were labeled with FAM 5 end and TAMRA 3 end . The primers and probe sequences were as follows

Thermal cycle Perkin Elmer ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector conditions were 48 C. for 30 minutes 95 C. for 10 minutes and 95 C. for 15 seconds and 60 C. for 1 minute for 40 cycles. Analyses of data were performed using Sequence Detector 1.6.3 PE Applied Biosystems and results for genes of interest were normalized to the RPL 19 gene.

The pHUSH inducible vector system comprising a shRNA expression shuttle plasmid and a viral vector backbone containing a TetR IRES Puro cassette was used Hoeflich K P et al Cancer res 66 999 1006 2006 . FGFR4 knockdown vectors were constructed by designing custom siRNA sequences converting them into shRNA and testing their efficacy in transient co transfection experiment in 293T cells. The following shRNA sequences were cloned into pShuttle H1 and then H1 shRNA cassette was transferred into pHUSH GW by a Gateway Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. recombination reaction 

HCT116 cells were transfected using LipofectAmine 2000 plus Invitrogen . As the puromycin resistance gene encoded in the vector is under the control of a constitutive actin promoter 5 g mL puromycin was used to select transfected cells expressing shRNA. Stable clones were isolated treated with 1 g mL doxycycline BD Clontech San Jose Calif. for 7 days to induce expression of siRNA. Functional FGFR4 protein knockdown was assessed by Western blotting.

Student s two tailed t test was used to compare data between two groups. One way analysis of variance and Dunnett s test were used to compare data between three or more groups. P value

FGF19 and FGFR4 protein expression was evaluated in human colon adenocarcinomas lung squamous cell carcinomas SCC and hepatocellular carcinomas HCC . FGF19 was overexpressed in 6 out of 10 colon adenocarcinomas and in 7 out of 10 lung SCC relative to normal tissues . Compared to normal tissues FGFR4 expression was not significantly altered in colon tumors but appeared downregulated in SCC .

To localize FGF19 and FGFR4 mRNA expression in tumor tissues we performed in situ hybridization. Messenger RNA for both genes was prominent in neoplastic epithelial cells in colon adenocarcinomas and lung SCC and D . In a tissue microarray comprised of 35 colon adenocarcinoma cases 26 74 had positive signal for FGF19 mRNA and 27 77 had positive signal for FGFR4 mRNA. Treatment with anti FGF19 antibody targets both non tumor derived FGF19 and tumor derived FGF19 and thus anti FGF19 treatment may have clinical benefit in FGFR4 positive tumors that lack FGF19 expression. Table 3 shows the presence or absence of co expression of FGFR4 and or FGF19 mRNAs in the colon adenocarcinoma tissue microarray samples 

Because systemic FGF19 expression in transgenic mice promotes hepatocellular carcinomas HCC Nicholes et al. 2002 we also evaluated FGF19 and FGFR4 mRNA expression in liver samples. Of 50 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma 23 46 demonstrated positive signal for FGF19 mRNA and 30 60 for FGFR4 mRNA. Both genes were expressed in the neoplastic hepatocytes representative examples shown in . The neoplastic hepatocytes also showed strong FGF19 protein staining by immunohistochemistry . Table 4 shows the presence or absence of co expression of FGFR4 and or FGF19 mRNAs in the colon adenocarcinoma tissue microarray samples 

Because cirrhosis often precedes hepatocellular carcinoma FGF19 mRNA expression was evaluated in cirrhotic liver. These samples showed strong FGF19 mRNA and protein signals in regenerative nodule hepatocytes suggesting that FGF19 expression occurs early during liver neoplastic progression.

FGF19 mRNA expression was also evaluated in several types of primary epithelial tumors by in situ hybridization. FGF19 mRNA expression was detected in 16 38 42 cases of breast adenocarcinoma 39 70 56 cases of ovarian adenocarcinoma and 8 79 10 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These results showed that FGF19 mRNA was expressed in several types of primary tumor. In addition a panel of colon adenocarcinoma was screened for expression of FRFR4 protein using immunohistochemistry and 18 20 samples were positive for FGFR4 expression.

FGF19 and FGFR4 mRNA and protein expression was analyzed in a panel of colon breast and liver tumor cell lines. We found FGF19 mRNA expression in a subset of colon cancer cell lines including Colo201 Colo205 SW620 SW480 and HCT116 . SNU185 SNU398 MCF7 and all colon cancer cell lines tested expressed FGFR4 mRNA. FGF19 and FGFR protein expression was determined in a panel of cancer cell lines using western blot analysis. With the exception of HT29 which did not express FGF19 protein the FGF19 and FGFR4 protein levels agreed with their mRNA expression in these cell lines . The electrophoretic mobility of the FGF19 secreted by the cell lines was consistent with the expected molecular mass of 24 kDa. However additional lower molecular mass bands were also detected possible representing truncated protein.

To verify that FGF19 protein expression is maintained in vivo colon cancer cell line derived tumor xenografts were evaluated by immunohistochemistry . Colo205 xenograft tumor tissue had strong FGF19 expression in all neoplastic epithelial cells throughout the tumor but not in the associated mouse stroma or adjacent normal tissue. SW620 and HCT116 xenografts showed positive immunoreactivity in scattered neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemistry of the FGF19 negative HT29 cell line xenograft did not show any staining. These results suggested that colon cancer cell lines express FGF19 upon growing in vitro in culture dishes as well as in vivo in a subcutaneous xenograft setting.

Glycosaminoglycan binding assays were performed to directly assess whether FGF19 protein and heparin interact. In a solid phase binding assay FGF1 demonstrated a dose dependent binding to the surface adsorbed purified heparan sulfate proteoglycan . By contrast FGF19 did not bind the coated material. In a pull down assay FGF1 strongly bound to heparin agarose affinity matrix. As previously reported FGF 1 was desorbed only with buffers containing NaCl concentrations higher than 1M. By contrast FGF19 did not significantly bind to heparin agarose at the lowest concentration of NaCl tested 20 mM and no protein could be detected after washes with higher NaCl concentrations . Together these results indicate that FGF19 did not bind significantly to glycosaminoglycan and therefore can not be considered a heparin binding factor.

Previous co immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the receptor binding specificity of FGF19 is restricted to FGFR4 Xie et al. 1999 . To examine FGF19 s binding specificity more completely we assessed its interaction with all known human FGFRs in their different alternatively spliced forms including the recently identified FGFR5 FGFRIL Sleeman et al. 2001 . In a solid phase assay FGF19 dose dependent binding was restricted to FGFR4 . In a receptor pull down assay FGF1 bound to all FGFRs whereas FGF19 interaction was limited to FGFR4 . These results are consistent with previous findings Ornitz et al. 1996 Xie et al. 1999 and further emphasize the unique binding specificity of FGF19 for FGFR4.

The specificity of the glycosaminoglycan requirement for FGF19 binding to FGFR4 was analyzed using a solid phase receptor binding assay. As seen in heparin constituted the most potent promoter of FGF19 interaction with FGFR4 EC 0.0025 g ml followed by heparan sulfate EC 0.9 g ml chondroitin sulfate B EC 1 g ml and chondroitin sulfate A EC 4 g ml . Chondroitin sulfate C did not promote FGF19 binding to FGFR4.

The effect of various lengths of heparin polysaccharide on FGFR4 binding promotion was also analyzed. The heparin octasaccharide showed only a minimal effect on FGFR4 binding at the highest concentration 10 g ml . The dose dependent promotion of FGF19 binding to FGFR4 was seen with heparin decasaccharide and longer fragments and this effect was proportional to the heparin molecular weight. Taken together these results showed that heparin constituted the most potent glycosaminoglycan supporting FGF19 binding to FGFR4 and that heparin s activity was proportional to its molecular weight.

FGF19 binding affinity to FGFR4 was assessed by incubating increasing concentration of I FGF19 with immobilized FGFR4 and heparin in the presence or the absence of an excess of unlabeled ligand. FGF19 demonstrated a dose dependent and saturable binding to FGFR4 inset . A Kof 0.25 nM for the FGF19 binding to FGFR4 was determined using Scatchard analysis confirming that the ligand and receptor interact with high affinity.

A panel of anti FGF19 mouse monoclonal antibodies was generated as described above. The polynucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined using routine sequencing methods. The anti FGF19 mab 1A6 VL and VH amino acid sequences are shown in .

To determine the binding affinity of mouse anti FGF19 Mabs surface plasmon resonance SRP measurement was performed with a BIAcore 3000 was used BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. as described above. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 5.

In enzyme linked immunosorbent assays anti FGF19 mabs 1A1 and 1A6 bound to FGF19 with a comparable EC50 of 40 pM whereas anti FGF19 mab 1D1 bound with an EC50 of 400 pM . In a solid phase receptor binding assay 1A6 blocked FGF19 binding to FGFR4 with an IC50 of 3 nM . 1A1 1D1 and an irrelevant control antibody did not inhibit this interaction.

Several cell based assays were performed in order to determine whether the anti FGF19 antibodies blocked the interaction of FGF19 and FGFR4.

FGF19 plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis by repressing hepatic expression of cholesterol 7 hydroxylase 1 Cyp7 1 the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol and bile acid synthesis Gutierrez et al 2006 Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 26 301 306 Yu et al 2000 J Biol Chem 275 15482 15489 . The ability of anti FGF19 antibodies 1A1 and 1A6 or isotype matched negative control antibody at concentrations ranging from 10 ug ml to 0.04 ug ml to block FGF19 induced downregulation of cyp7 1 was assessed using hepatocellular carcinoma HEP3B cells Schlessinger Science 306 1506 1507 2004 as described above. In the absence of anti FGF19 antibody FGF19 treatment reduced cyp7 1 expression by 75 . Treatment with 1.1 g ml mouse anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 abolished FGF19 induced repression of cyp7 1 expression. By contrast treatment with mouse anti FGF19 Mab clone 1A1 only reduced the repression by 50 at the highest concentration tested 10 g ml but not at lower antibody concentrations. The presence of a control antibody did not affect FGF19 activity. The IC50 for anti FGF19 antibody 1 A6 inhibition of FGF19 induced downregulation of cyp7 1 gene expression was about 0.4 ug ml. The IC50 for anti FGF19 antibody 1A1 inhibition of FGF19 induced downregulation of cyp7 1 gene expression was about 10 ug ml.

Anti FGF19 mab 1A6 was also tested for its ability to block the FGF19 induced FGF pathway activation in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells Eswarakumar et al 2005 Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 16 139 149 Schlessinger J 2004 Science 306 1506 1507 . Serum starved hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells were treated with FGF19 in the absence or the presence of a negative control antibody or with various concentrations of anti FGF19 monoclonal antibodies 1A6 or 1D1 at 30 10 and 3.3 ng ml and FRS2 and MAPK phosphorylation determined as described above. Treatment with anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 significantly blocked FGF19 induced FRS2 and MAPK phosphorylation at all doses tested . By contrast treatment with the control antibody and anti FGF19 mab 1D1 did not show significant inhibitory activity.

Because FGFR4 plays a role in cell migration we evaluated the chemotactic activity of FGF19 Wang et al 2005 Clin Cancer Res 10 6169 6178 . In a modified Boyden chamber assay FGF19 promoted HCT116 cell migration in a dose dependent fashion reaching a maximum at 16 ng ml . The anti FGF19 mabs were tested for the ability to inhibit FGF19 promoted cell migration. At 0.1 g ml treatment with anti FGF19 mab 1A6 inhibited FGF19 induced cell migration . Treatment with higher concentrations of 1A6 reduced cell migration to below the basal HCT116 cell migration level likely by inhibiting both exogenously added and endogenously produced FGF19.

These results demonstrated that anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 was a potent inhibitor of FGF19 activity in vitro.

A mass spectrometric approach was used to localize the epitopes of anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 and 1A1 and to evaluate whether FGF19 conformational components contributed to their binding. We first attempted to isolate an epitope containing peptide from an FGF19 tryptic digest using an agarose coupled 1A6 affinity matrix. This approach was unsuccessful possibly because the FGF19 fragmentation compromised the conformational integrity of 1A6 epitope. To test this hypothesis we modified the procedure and FGF19 was incubated with the agarose coupled antibodies and the adsorbed protein was then digested with trypsin. The analysis of the total digest demonstrated a complete fragmentation of the adsorbed FGF19 without 1A6 masking of any trypsin cleavage sites . The matrix was washed extensively and the bound peptides were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. The non specifically adsorbed peptides were identified using an irrelevant control antibody coupled to agarose in a parallel experiment.

The results of this analysis are shown in . The agarose coupled anti FGF19 mab 1A6 specifically recognized the FGF19 peptide G133 R155 . Agarose coupled anti FGF19 mab 1A1 specifically recognized the peptide G156 R180 .

Because conjugation of anti FGF19 mab 1D1 to agarose abolished its binding to FGF19 a peptide competition binding assay was used to identify its epitope. Only FGF19 amino acids A183 G192 competed with mab 1D1 binding . This peptide did not compete the binding of mab 1A1 to FGF19. Because overlapping peptides were used in this competition assay we surmise that the mab 1D1 epitope is located in the last 4 distal FGF19 amino acids SFEK .

The epitopes of mabs 1A1 1D1 and 1A6 were mapped onto the previously described structural model of FGF19 interaction with FGFR4 Harmer et al 2004 Biochemistry 43 629 640 . The epitopes of 1A1 and 1D1 are located in a distal portion of FGF19 that is not represented on this model due to its lack of ordered structure. However the 1A6 epitope is localized in the FGF19 binding interface with FGFR4 . These results suggest that anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 directly occludes the receptor binding site of FGF19.

To determine whether FGF19 neutralization could inhibit tumor growth in vivo anti FGF19 antibodies were tested in two tumor xenograph models as described above. The colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and colo201 were selected because they expressed both FGF19 and FGFR4 and form tumors in vivo. In addition anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 showed a blocking activity on the FGF19 induced HCT116 cells migration in vitro.

Mice with established HCT116 xenograft tumors were treated twice weekly with 5 mg kg of either anti FGF19 mab 1A6 or a control antibody. At day 35 treatment with anti FGF19 mab 1A6 significantly suppressed tumor growth by 57 p 0.07 n 5 compared to the control antibody treated group . This study was repeated using a higher dose of antibody 1A6 15 mg kg 2 week and a statistically significant suppression of tumor growth was observed 60 growth inhibition p 0.01 n 5 .

To verify that anti FGF19 mab 1A6 inhibited tumor growth by blocking FGF19 activity tumors were examined at the end of the study for markers of FGFR4 signaling. Activation of FGFR4 FRS2 ERK and catenin was significantly decreased in tumors from animals treated with anti FGF19 mab 1A6 compared to animals treated with the control antibody .

Next we used xenografts of Colo201 a colon cancer cell line expressing higher FGF19 levels than HCT116 . Treatment 30 mg kg 2 week with anti FGF19 mab 1A6 significantly suppressed the growth of established colo201 tumors at day 27 64 growth inhibition p 0.03 n 5 compared to the control antibody . Analysis of the excised tumors showed that treatment with anti FGF19 mab 1A6 significantly decreased FGFR4 FRS2 ERK and catenin activation in xenograft tumors compared to the control antibody treatment . These results demonstrated efficacy of anti FGF19 mab 1A6 in colon cancer models and demonstrated its activity with inhibition of FGF19 dependent FGFR4 FRS2 ERK and catenin activation.

Over expression of FGF19 in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice resulted in development of hepatocellular carcinomas by 10 12 months of age Nicholes et al. Am J Pathol. 160 2295 2307 2002 . To confirm that FGF19 is acting as a tumor promoter in this model we treated the FGF19 transgenic mice with a tumor initiator diethylnitrosamine DEN which accelerated tumor formation by 50 . To determine whether anti FGF19 mab 1A6 could prevent hepatocellular carcinomas DEN accelerated FGF19 transgenic mice were treated with either 1A6 or control antibody anti gp120 for 6 months. At the end of the treatment all of the control treated mice had grossly evident multifocal large hepatocellular carcinomas throughout the liver lobes whereas anti FGF19 mab 1A6 treated animals had either no liver tumors or in one case 1862 a single small tumor present on the diaphragmatic surface of the median lobe . Liver weights from anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 treated mice mean 1.71 0.05 grams were significantly lower than liver weights from control treated mice mean 3.15 0.58 grams p 0.014 but were not significantly different from those of normal FVB wild type mice mean 1.56 0.08 grams p 0.82 . In addition tumor volume was determined by micro CT image analysis corrected for tumor volume with normal FVB liver and graphed as a percent of total liver volume . Percent tumor volume of anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 treated mice mean 7.5 3.2 was significantly lower than control gp120 treated mice mean 23.8 6.8 p 0.05 . Furthermore tumor weights strongly correlated with percent tumor volume r 0.993702 . These data clearly demonstrated that anti FGF19 Mab 1A6 effectively neutralized circulating FGF19 to prevent tumor formation in FGF19 transgenic mice.

Because FGF19 causes weight loss when overexpressed as a transgene in mice Tomlinson et al. Endocrinology. 2002 May 143 5 1741 7 we evaluated body weights of mice in the two treatment groups.

Hepatocellular carcinomas found in FGF19 expressing transgenic mice have neoplastic cell that show immunoreactivity with beta cadherin catenin or b cat antibodies Nicoles et al. supra . Furthermore it has been suggested that Wnt signaling can initiate or promote FGF signaling in various cell types and organs during a variety of cellular processes including human colorectal carcinogenesis and that co activation of Wnt and FGF signaling pathways in tumors leads to more malignant phenotypes see refs 7 12 in Cancer Biol Therapy 5 9 1059 64 2006 . Thus the effect of FGF19 or inhibition of FGF19 signaling on the Wnt signaling pathway was tested using treatment with FGF19 treatment with anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody 1A6 or FGFR4 directed shRNA knockdown in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. catenin tyrosine phosphorylation catenin E cadherin binding and active catenin levels were assessed in treated cells using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis.

Treatment of colon cancer cells HCT116 with FGF19 25 100 ng m1 resulted in a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of catenin as early as 10 min when compared with vehicle treated controls. catenin binding to cadherins to form stable cell cell adhesions has been shown to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of catenin. Therefore we evaluated E cadherin levels in cells treated with FGF19 by stripping and reprobing the tyrosine phosphorylation blot using anti E cadherin antibody. The results showed a substantial loss of E cadherin binding to catenin in FGF19 treated cells. Similar results were obtained when E cadherin was immunoprecipitated and immunoblot analysis was performed using anti catenin antibody. The reduction in E cadherin binding was inversely proportional to the increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels observed in FGF19 treated cells.

Previous studies have established that Wnt regulated catenin degradation is essential for carcinogenesis Polakis et al. Genes Dev 14 1837 51 2000 and that Wnt signals are transmitted through N terminally dephosphorylated catenin Staal F J T et al EMBO Reports 3 63 68 2002 . Using a specific antibody specific for catenin dephosphorylated at residues Ser37 and Thr41 we examined whether FGF19 or inhibition of FGF19 affects Wnt signaling in HCT116 cells. Treatment of HCT116 cells with FGF19 did not affect active catenin levels at any dose or time point indicating that endogenous FGF19 activated catenin at saturated levels in an autocrine fashion. However treatment of HCT116 cells with anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 significantly reduced active catenin levels at timepoints as early as 3 hrs following treatment and sustained decreased active catenin levels for up to 24 hrs 71.8 1.5 decrease vs gp120 p

Since FGF19 inhibition reduced active catenin levels in HCT116 cells we next evaluated whether treatment with anti FGF19 antibody resulted in increased N terminal Ser Thr phosphorylation of catenin and thus targeted catenin for ubiquitination and proteasomic degradation. HCT116 cells pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 1 M for 4 hrs followed by treatment with anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody 1A6 showed a significant increase in Ser33 Ser37 and Ser45 Thr41 phosphorylation when compared with proteasome inhibitor plus control antibody gp120 treated cells . Quantification of Ser33 37 phosphorylation as determined by calculating the ratio between the total catenin protein and phosphorylated protein level showed a 123.4 7 increase p

Ser Thr phosphorylation in the N terminus of catenin was further analyzed using linear ion trap mass spectrometry. Signal intensities of non phosphorylated catenin peptide were determined using linear ion trap mass spectrometry in cells pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor followed by treatment with either anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 or control anti gp20 antibody. The data was normalized to non related peptides containing all 4 phosphorylation sites that showed no difference in signal intensities from the treated and untreated samples. The P catenin peptide isolated from anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 treated cells showed lower signal intensity when compared with catenin peptide isolated from control anti gp120 antibody treated cells clearly indicating increased phosphorylation on the N terminus of catenin in anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody 1A6 treated cells.

To determine whether inhibition of the FGFR4 receptor would mimic the effect of FGF19 inhibition resulting from treatment with anti FGF19 antibodies stable cell lines expressing FGFR4 directed shRNA and control EGFP directed shRNA were generated as described above. The stable cell line expressing FGFR4 directed shRNA showed effective knock down of FGFR4 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from a stable cell line expression FGFR4 directed shRNA showed almost complete reduction of active catenin levels when compared with a control stable cell line expressing shRNA directed to EGFP .

Wnt target gene cyclin D1 CD44 E cad c jun expression levels were determined using real time PCR in anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 treated HCT116 cells. As shown in treatment with anti FGF19 antibody 1A6 reduced cyclin D1 CD44 E cad and c jun mRNA expression levels at 6 hrs when compared with expression of those genes in control antibody anti gp 120 treated cells.
