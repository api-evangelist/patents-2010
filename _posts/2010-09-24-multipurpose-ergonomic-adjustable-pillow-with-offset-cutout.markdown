The invention relates to bedding and more particularly to a pillow having a U shaped offset cutout for sleeping with adjustable sides and shapes allowing for optimal comfort of the user.

Pillows are important for sleeping resting and for creating comfort. Ever since pillows were invented there has been a need to have a pillow that is adjustable in terms of fullness and has utilities that support the head neck and face in a variety of supine resting and upright positions.

Currently sleep pillows are designed for sleep in a supine position. They typically cannot be adjusted for fullness and are not suitable for all sleeping positions. Pillows with larger amounts of loft for instance are recommended and labeled for side sleeping while pillows with lesser amounts of loft are recommended and labeled for stomach sleepers. There is a need for a single sleeping pillow that can be adjusted for fullness and is suitable for all supine sleeping positions side back and stomach .

Currently pillows are designed for use in a supine position. However these pillows are not comfortable when used in a reclining or upright position. They are often too large too heavy and do not stay in place. There is a need for a pillow that is adjustable in terms of fullness and can be used comfortably in both supine and reclining upright positions.

For those who sleep on their sides or on their stomach in a prone position a traditional pillow is often uncomfortable. The nose is blocked so one has to rotate one s head significantly to one side in order to breathe freely. This can lead to neck and shoulder discomfort. There is a need for a pillow that is adjustable for fullness creates a clear pathway to the nose for breathing keeps the head and neck in relative alignment and provides optimal comfort for side and stomach sleepers.

It would be advantageous to provide comfort to side and stomach sleepers who can rotate a pillow cutout to the side. The soft arms created by a cutout can support the head and neck while the face remains suspended over the cutout.

Certain pillows are designed for individuals who sleep with a continuous positive airway passage CPAP type device for a condition known as sleep apnea. Typically these pillows have a cutout to reduce face mask pressure and to create a clear pathway to the nose and mouth for easier breathing. However these pillows are not adjustable for fullness. Furthermore these prior art CPAP pillows are not suitable for reclining and upright positions. There is a need for a pillow that can be adjusted for fullness is compatible with a CPAP type device and can be used in both supine and reclining upright positions.

Prior art beauty pillows are designed to reduce facial pressure following facial plastic surgery. Typically these pillows have a centered cutout to reduce facial pressure. These pillows are not adjustable for fullness. They do not have an offset cutout that accommodates users with varying neck and shoulder sizes. Furthermore they are not suitable for reclining or upright positions positions that are often recommended following facial plastic surgery. There is a need for a pillow that can be adjusted for fullness accommodates varying neck and shoulder sizes and can be used in both supine and reclining upright positions.

Many people enjoy having head and neck support while in a reclining or upright position. Currently some pillows are designed to support the neck specifically. However these pillows are not adjustable in terms of fullness do not accommodate a variety of body types and furthermore do not support the head. A pillow is needed that is adjustable and supports the head and neck in reclining upright positions.

Prior art pillows intended for sleeping and resting are not aesthetically decorative. In contrast most decorative pillows are not practical for sleep and rest. There is a need for a pillow that is adjustable versatile can be used in a variety of sleeping and resting positions and yet is also decorative. The present invention has an outer contoured pillowcase available in a variety of fabrics to match home decor making it aesthetically suitable for bedroom family room or living room.

Some pillows are not easily portable due to size. The standard sleep pillow is too large to carry on a plane or fit neatly into a small overnight suitcase. There is a need for a compact pillow that is portable is adjustable in terms of fullness and supports the head neck and face in a variety of supine resting and upright positions.

Some smaller portable pillows i.e. neck pillows do not have removable and washable pillowcases. The covers cannot be washed without washing the entire pillow. There is a need for a pillow that is portable has a removable and washable pillowcase and is versatile and adjustable to support the head neck and face in a variety of supine resting and upright positions.
