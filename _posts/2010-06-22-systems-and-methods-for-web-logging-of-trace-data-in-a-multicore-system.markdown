title: Systems and methods for web logging of trace data in a multi-core system
abstract: A method and system for generating a web log that includes transaction entries from transaction queues of one or more cores of a multi-core system. A transaction queue is maintained for each core so that either a packet engine or web logging client executing on the core can write transaction entries to the transaction queue. In some embodiments, a timestamp value obtained from a synchronized timestamp variable can be assigned to the transaction entries. When a new transaction entry is added to the transaction queue, the earliest transaction entry is removed from the transaction queue and added to a heap. Periodically the earliest entry in the heap is removed from the heap and written to a web log. When an entry is removed from the heap, the earliest entry in a transaction queue corresponding to the removed entry is removed from the transaction queue and added to the heap.

This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 219 213 filed on Jun. 22 2009 the disclosure of which is considered part of the disclosure of this application and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to web logging in a multi core system.

Web logging is used in many systems to track and maintain a history of HTTP transactions that are handled by a system. In particular web logging can be used to track any of the following types of records a request record a response record a transaction record and an abort record. When web logging is enabled in a single core system the records logged are for the most sequential according to the order in which they are received and processed by the single processor in the system. Network traffic is typically distributed amongst multiple cores in a multi core system such that each core can generate its own set of sequential transactions. Thus challenges arise when trying to merge one or more sequential sets of records because there can exist multiple transactions at any point in time. Further merging the chronological transactions requires determining the ordering of core s series of transactions in relation to the other cores transactions.

In one aspect described herein are embodiments of methods and systems for generating a web log from one or more transaction queues associated with one or more cores of a multi core system. A transaction queue is maintained for each core so that either a packet engine or web logging client executing on the core can write HTTP and other web transaction entries to the transaction queue. When a new transaction entry is added to the transaction queue the earliest transaction entry is removed from the transaction queue and added to a global heap. Periodically the earliest entry in the global heap is removed from the global heap and written to a web log. When an entry is removed from the heap the earliest entry in a transaction queue corresponding to the removed entry is removed from the transaction queue and added to the global heap.

In another aspect described herein is a method or system for storing transaction entries generated by packet engines of cores of a multi core system to a heap. A first core of a multi core system can write a first transaction entry that has a first timestamp to a first transaction queue of the first core. In response to determining that the first core wrote to the first transaction queue a logging client executing on the multi core system can extract the first transaction entry from the first transaction queue. The logging client can then chronologically store the extracted first transaction entry in a heap that includes or comprises a chronological list of transaction entries. A second core of the multi core system can write a second transaction entry that has a second timestamp later than the first timestamp of the first transaction entry to a second transaction queue of the second core. In response to determining that the second core wrote to the second transaction queue the logging client can extract the second transaction entry from the second transaction queue. The logging client can then chronologically store the extracted second transaction entry in the heap after the first transaction entry.

In one embodiment the first transaction entry can be generated by a first packet engine of the first core while in another embodiment the second transaction entry can be generated by a second packet engine of the second core.

In another embodiment the first transaction entry can be chronologically stored in the heap in response to determining that the first transaction entry does not reside in the heap. The second transaction entry in some embodiments can be chronologically stored in the heap in response to determining that the second transaction entry does not reside in the heap.

The logging client in some embodiments can extract the first transaction entry from the heap and identify a log file that corresponds to the first transaction entry. The logging client can then update the log file with the first transaction entry. In some embodiments the logging client can extract another transaction entry from the first transaction queue and can chronologically store the other transaction entry in response to extracting the transaction entry from the first transaction queue.

In one embodiment extracting the first transaction entry can include identifying a transaction entry in the first transaction queue that has an earliest timestamp and extracting the identified transaction entry. In another embodiment extracting the second transaction entry can include identifying a transaction entry in the second transaction queue that has an earliest timestamp and extracting the identified transaction entry.

Chronologically storing the extracted first transaction entry in some embodiments can include chronologically storing the first transaction entry after a transaction entry having an earlier timestamp.

In yet another aspect described herein is a method or system for generating a timestamp variable that is shared by a plurality of packet engines that execute on a plurality of cores of a multi core system. A first packet engine executing on a first core of the multi core system can acquire a lock on shared memory. In response to acquiring this lock the first packet engine can allocate memory from the shared memory to a timestamp variable and then release the lock on the shared memory. A second packet engine executing on a second core of the multi core system can then acquire a lock on the shared memory. In response to acquiring this lock the second packet engine can determine the timestamp variable exists. In response to determining the timestamp variable exists the second packet engine can release the lock on the shared memory.

In some embodiments the first packet engine can update the timestamp variable according to a clock. Updating the timestamp variable can include storing a microsecond timestamp in the memory allocated to the timestamp variable.

In other embodiments a third packet engine executing on a third core of the multi core system can obtain a value of the timestamp variable and assign the obtained timestamp variable to a transaction entry generated by the third packet engine. The first packet engine in some embodiments can increment the timestamp variable subsequent to the third packet engine obtaining the value of the timestamp variable.

In one embodiment allocating memory to the timestamp variable can include writing the timestamp variable to a section of the shared memory. In other embodiments determining the timestamp variable exists can include identifying a timestamp variable stored in the shared memory.

In still another aspect described herein is a method and system for logging transaction entries that are generated by packet engines that execute on cores of a multi core system and stored in a heap. A logging client that executes on a multi core system can identify a first transaction entry that is stored in a heap that includes chronologically ordered transaction entries. The identified first transaction entry can have an earlier timestamp than each additional transaction entry that is stored in the heap. The logging client can then extract the first transaction entry from the heap where the first transaction entry can correspond to a transaction queue of a core in the multi core system. In response to extracting the first transaction entry the logging client can identify a log file that corresponds to a filter that corresponds to the first transaction entry. The logging client can then update the log file with the first transaction entry and in response to updating the log file the logging client can extract a second transaction entry from the transaction queue. The logging client can then store the second transaction entry in the heap.

In some embodiments extracting the second transaction entry from the transaction queue can include extracting a transaction entry having an earliest timestamp.

In other embodiments the second transaction entry can be stored in the heap in response to determining the second transaction entry does not reside in the heap.

In still another embodiment the log file can correspond to a file that is based on a tuple that corresponds to the transaction entry.

In yet another embodiment a packet engine executing on the core can generate the first transaction entry and the second transaction entry. The generated first transaction entry and second transaction entry can then be written to the transaction queue of the core.

In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. ny portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier.

In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core e.g. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core e.g. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory e.g. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

Systems that manage and otherwise process network traffic can log or otherwise track certain aspects of the HTTP traffic processed by the multi core system . Logging web data processed by the multi core system can require that the transactions for each core in the multi core system be stored. Many web analyzers expect web log data to be in chronological order therefore the multi core system compiles the web log data into a web log that contains transactions for each core ordered chronologically according to the time and date when the transaction occurred and either with the earliest transaction first or the latest transaction first.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system for logging web data. The multi core system includes one or more processing cores executing one or more packet engines and associated with one or more transaction queues A N referred to generally as transaction queues . Each transaction queue core and packet engine has access to a global heap stored in a memory element within the multi core system . A web logging client executing within the multi core system can also access the global heap and can further comprise or execute a number of transaction filters . The web logging client can communicate with and otherwise read from or write to a web log buffer stored in a memory element within the multi core system .

Further referring to and in more detail in one embodiment the multi core system can be any of the multi core systems described herein. In particular the multi core system can be any of the multi core systems described in . The multi core system can execute on an appliance a client a server or any other computing machine that executes a multi core system . While the multi core system illustrated in includes a plurality of cores and a web logging client in some embodiments the multi core system can comprise additional devices and can execute additional programs clients and modules.

The cores within the multi core system can be any of the cores described herein. In one embodiment the multi core system can include any N number of cores where N is a whole number greater than zero. In other embodiments the multi core system can include eight cores. Cores can be dedicated to process programs or services performing certain functions and in some embodiments can be dedicated to process data packets received or transmitted by certain devices or program modules. In some embodiments each core can execute any of the following a packet engine such as any of the packet engines described herein or a flow distributor such as any of the flow distributors described herein.

In one embodiment each core executes a packet engine A N and may include any of the vServers described herein. A packet engine A N can be included in each core and collectively the packet engines A N can be referred to as a packet engine . Packet engines in some embodiments alter or modify tuples of data packets according to flow distribution rules executed by each packet engine . In other embodiments the packet engine can facilitate writing transaction data to a transaction queue associated with each core . The packet engine in some embodiments communicates with one or more servers to forward servers received data packets that are destined for those servers . Similarly the packet engine in some embodiments communicates with one or more clients to forward clients received data packets that are destined for those clients .

In some embodiments each packet engine can access memory in a shared memory bus or can access memory in a global cache . Accessing this memory can include writing to memory space or a range of memory addresses reading from a memory space or range of memory addresses or allocating memory from the shared memory bus or global cache to a variable. In some embodiments a packet engine executing on a core can obtain a lock on the shared memory or global cache thereby preventing all other packet engines from reading writing or otherwise accessing the shared memory or global cache . In these embodiments the other packet engines can access the shared memory or global cache only when the packet engine that obtained the lock releases the lock.

Included on each core can be a transaction queue that tracks a history of all the HTTP transactions processed by a particular core or handled by a packet engine executing on the core . The transaction queue in some embodiments can be a buffer storage repository database list table or other data structure for storing transaction entries. The transaction queue can be stored in a memory element within the multi core system where the memory element can be accessed by a particular core assigned to that memory element. In other embodiments a packet engine executing on a control core a web logging client and any other web logging module software or hardware can access the transaction queue of any core .

Entries are stored into a transaction queue by a web logging client executing on a core by the packet engine by a web logging sub routine included within the packet engine or by any other module executing on the core and maintaining a history of HTTP transactions handled by a packet engine executing on that particular core . In some embodiments three types of entries can be stored in the transaction queue these entries are a request record a response record a transaction record and an abort record. A request record can contain the entire HTTP request header and offsets of various elements in the header. A request record can be generated when the entire HTTP request header is received and processed by the system. A response record can contain a HTTP response header and offsets of various elements in the header. The response record can be generated when the entire HTTP response header has been received and parsed. A transaction record can contain fields indicating the transaction end time transaction duration and the request and response packet sizes. In some embodiments the transaction record can contain a timestamp value. This timestamp value in some embodiments can be a value obtained from a timestamp variable stored in a shared memory or global cache . A transaction record can be generated when the last byte of the HTTP response is received from the server. An abort record can be generated when a HTTP transaction could not be tracked by the multi core system or when a transaction is abruptly terminated.

In some embodiments the transaction queue can be a circular buffer associated with a global write pointer that points to the location in the buffer at which the next weblog record can be written. Each connection managed by the core or the packet engine executing on the core can be associated with a read pointer. In some embodiments the read pointer is associated with those connections to a web logging process or a process typically logged e.g. a HTTP transaction. The read pointer in some embodiments can point to the next byte of log data that is to be sent to the web logging process. Records are written into the transaction queue based on the order in which they are generated. This order in some embodiments can be a chronological order such that each subsequent record in the transaction queue has a chronologically later timestamp than the previous record. For example a subsequent record can have a timestamp of 5 32 45 while the previous record can have a timestamp of 5 13 22. In this example the subsequent record has a chronologically later timestamp value. In still other embodiments the transaction queue can store the transaction records in any chronological order. Thus the transaction queue can store the records in ascending or descending chronological order. For example a subsequent record can have a timestamp of 5 10 24 while the previous record can have a timestamp of 5 43 10.

In some embodiments transactions can be associated with a transaction identifier ID that is generated by the packet engine a flow distributor or a web logging client a NIC or any other module or hardware able to assign a transaction ID when a HTTP request arrives or is received by the multi core system . In some embodiments all web logs corresponding to a HTTP transaction carry or are otherwise characterized by the same transaction ID. A core identifier ID can be assigned to transactions based on the core that hosted the transaction or otherwise created the web log. Thus all web logs corresponding to transactions hosted or executed by a particular core can have a core ID that corresponds to that core . The web logging client can use the core ID associated with each web log to differentiate between web logs generated by different cores.

When in some embodiments a connection between the web logging client and a core within the multi core system is broken the web logging client can discard all incomplete transaction entries e.g. all entries that require a transaction record or abort record for further processing. Thus if the connection between the web logging client and a first core is broken or destroyed the web logging client can discard all transaction entries having a core ID corresponding to the first core when those transaction entries are not matched to a corresponding transaction record or abort record. Discarding all un matched and therefore incomplete transaction entries occurs because further processing of the transaction entry may be required. This further processing can be required because the entries have not been matched to either a transaction record or abort record and therefore have not been completely processed or assembled into a full transaction record entry. Further the transaction record and the abort record required for additional processing may have been overwritten due to a web log buffer overflow on the core or due to some other occurrence or event.

Each core in some embodiments accesses a storage repository allocated to each core or a shared storage repository available to all cores in a multi core system via a packet engine or any other module or object executing on the core . Thus each module program client and or object executing on the core can access any storage repository accessible to the core .

Each core each packet engine the web logging client and any other module object or hardware item can access a global heap included within the multi core system . While illustrates the global heap as resident within the multi core system in some embodiments the global heap and each of the transaction queues associated with the various packet engines cores can be maintained by the web logging client . In this embodiment the web logging client maintains a global heap can be accessible by only the web logging client which facilitates updating the global heap by writing entries from the transaction queues into the global heap according to the methods and systems described herein. In still other embodiments the global heap and each of the transaction queues can be maintained by either the flow distributor or the RSS module . In this embodiment the global heap can be accessible only by either the flow distributor or the RSS module which communicates with the web logging client to facilitate updating the global heap with transaction entries from the transaction queues . In some embodiments the global heap can be accessed by either the web logging client or the flow distributor RSS module but not both. The global heap in some embodiments can be a storage repository or other storage data structure stored in a memory element within the multi core system . The global heap can be a heap that includes a tree like data structure or hierarchy that includes a root node comprising a most significant entry or in some cases an earliest log entry. Each of the other nodes or data elements in the heap is less significant smaller or later than the root node or entry. Thus the heap can contain a root entry corresponding to a web log entry having a date and time of Oct. 1 2010 at 10 00 AM. A first subsequent entry depending from the root entry can have a date and time of Oct. 10 2010 at 1 00 PM and a second subsequent entry depending from the root entry can have a date and time of Oct. 10 2010 at 10 00 PM. Another entry can depend from the first entry depending from the root entry this additional entry can have a date and time of Oct. 11 2010 at 1 00 AM. Thus the heap has a tree like data structure where the entries at the bottom have a later timestamp than the entries at the top where a later date time includes a date and time closest to the current date and an earlier date time includes a date and time furthest away from the current date and time.

The global heap can in some embodiments receive the head of each transaction queue when entries are added to the transaction queues . Therefore in some embodiments each time a transaction queue is altered by the addition of a data packet the earliest data packet in the transaction queue is added to the global heap . Before the entry is added to the global heap a check can be made as to whether the entry is already in the global heap . When the entry does not already exist in the global heap the entry is added or inserted into the global heap . When the entry does already exist in the global heap the entry is removed from the transaction queue where it is stored and deleted or otherwise removed from memory in the multi core system . In some embodiments the above described method or process can be carried out by a packet engine executing on the core . In other embodiments the above described method or process can be carried out by a web logging agent module or client executing on the core and in some embodiments executed by the packet engine .

Executing within the multi core system is a web logging client or logging client that can in some embodiments execute on a control core in the multi core system and in other embodiments can execute on a first core or on any core in the multi core system . In still other embodiments the web logging client can execute on a separate computing machine or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . This separate computing machine or appliance can communicate with the multi core system via a network between the multi core system and the remote computing machine or appliance. In some embodiments the remote computing machine or appliance executing the web logging client can communicate with the flow distributor the RSS module or any of the packet engines using TCP over IP. The web logging client can in some embodiments obtain a request record response record. These records in some embodiments are not written to a web log or the web log buffer until the web logging client can identify a corresponding transaction record. Thus the web logging client obtains a first transaction record and compares the first transaction record the request record and the response record to filters in the web logging client . When it is determined that the first transaction record matches the request record and the response record then the transaction record the response record and the request record are written to the web log. When no match is identified the web logging client can identify a second transaction record and proceed to match the second transaction record the response record and the request record against the filters . If a match is determined then the transaction record the response record and the request record are written to the web log buffer. While the above mentioned process matches request and response records to a transaction record in some embodiments the web logging client stores the records for a HTTP transaction until either the transaction record or the abort record for a transaction is received. Thus the above described method can be carried out for an abort record. In embodiments where either an abort record is received or where a transaction record does not match any of the other records the un matched transaction record or the received abort record are discarded.

The transaction filters can include any filter. In some embodiments the transaction filters can include filters that input response and request records along with a transaction record and determines whether the transaction record matches the inputted response and request record. Similarly in other embodiments the transaction filters can include filters that input response and request records along with an abort record and determines whether the abort record matches the inputted response and request record. The transaction filters can include any filter that inputs a web log and compares it against a transaction or abort record. In some embodiments the comparison can include an analysis of the web logs and a determination as to whether they derive from a corresponding transaction or abort record.

The web log buffer can comprise any buffer or memory element. In some embodiments the web log buffer can be a circular buffer. In other embodiments the web log buffer stores the compiled web log. In other embodiments the web log buffer can be stored in any memory element within the multi core system . In still other embodiments the contents of the web log buffer can be written to a web log file or other memory element dedicated to storing the web log contents.

Illustrated in is one embodiment of a method for updating the global heap with transaction entries from a transaction queue associated with the core . A web logging client determines whether a transaction entry has been added to a transaction queue on a core in the multi core system Step . When it is determined that a transaction entry has been added to a transaction queue on a core the web logging client further determines whether the transaction queue head is in the global heap Step . When the web logging client determines that the transaction queue head is not in the global heap the web logging client adds the head to the heap Step .

Further referring to and in more detail in one embodiment the web logging client determines whether a transaction entry has been added to a transaction queue on a core in the multi core system Step . This determination can be made in some embodiments based on a notice generated by a packet engine executing on the core or a web logging client executing on the core . In some embodiments the web logging client can hook into a call made to the transaction queue by either the packet engine or the web logging client. The call can in some embodiments be a request to write an entry into the transaction queue . In other embodiments determining that a transaction entry has been added to at least one transaction queue can include receiving a message from a packet engine or a web logging client executing on a core indicating that a entry has been added to a transaction queue .

Determining that a transaction entry has been added to a transaction queue on a core can occur after the addition of the transaction entry. In some embodiments a transaction entry is added to a transaction queue when a core writes a transaction entry to the transaction queue . Writing a transaction entry to the transaction queue can include having a packet engine generate a transaction entry and store or write the transaction entry to the appropriate transaction queue . The appropriate transaction queue in some embodiments can be the transaction queue that resides on the same core as the packet engine . In one embodiment the core or packet engine can assign a timestamp value to the transaction entry prior to writing the transaction entry to the transaction queue . Any of the cores or packet engines can write to a transaction queue at any point in time. For example one core can write a transaction entry to a transaction queue of that core while another core can write another transaction entry to another transaction queue of that other core.

In some embodiments a web logging client executing on the core determines that a transaction entry has been written to the transaction queue on that core . In this embodiment the web logging client can write the transaction entry to the transaction queue and therefore can subsequently determine whether the head of the transaction queue is included in the global heap Step and can further write the head of the transaction queue to the global heap when the web logging client executing on the core determines that the head is not included within the global heap Step .

Determining whether the transaction queue head is included in the global heap Step can include reviewing the most recent queue entries to determine whether the transaction queue head is stored within the global heap . A transaction queue head in some embodiments can be the entry in the transaction queue having the earliest timestamp. In still other embodiments determining whether the transaction queue head is included in the global heap can include searching through the heap for a transaction entry having a transaction ID corresponding to the earliest transaction entry in the transaction queue . The determination can further include searching through the heap for a transaction entry having a core ID corresponding to the core associated with the transaction queue at issued. When a transaction entry having the same transaction ID and the same core ID of the transaction queue head is found then a determination is made that the global heap already includes the transaction queue head. When no transaction entry having the same transaction ID and the same core ID of the transaction queue can be found within the global heap a determination is made that the global heap does not already include the transaction queue head.

In still other embodiments determining whether the transaction queue head is included in the global heap Step can include setting a flag in transaction queue that indicates whether the transaction queue head is already included in the global heap. In still other embodiments each entry in the transaction queue can have an associated flag indicating whether or not that particular entry is already included in the global heap. Thus determining whether the transaction queue head is included in the global heap can include reviewing a flag associated with either the transaction queue or the transaction queue head to determine whether the transaction queue head has already been included in the global heap . For example when the flag has a value of logical one or on the transaction queue head is already in the global heap however when the flag has a value of logical zero or off the transaction queue head is not already in the global heap and vice versa.

Either the packet engine executing on the core a web logging client executing on the core or the web logging client can determine whether the head of the transaction queue is included within the global heap . The determination can be made by any analysis of the global heap that can determine whether a particular transaction entry is already included in the global heap .

When a determination is made that the transaction entry is not included in the global heap then the web logging client a packet engine on the core a web logging client on the core or any other module or object can insert or otherwise add the head of the transaction queue to the global heap Step . Adding the transaction queue head to the heap can further include removing the transaction queue head from the heap . Still further adding the transaction queue head to the heap can include inserting the transaction entry corresponding to the transaction queue head into a section of the heap corresponding to a timestamp of the transaction entry. Thus the transaction entry is entered into the heap so that earlier entries are populated above the transaction entry and later entries are populated below the transaction entry.

When a determination is made that the transaction entry is included in the global heap the transaction entry corresponding to the transaction queue head can be removed from the transaction queue and destroyed.

In some embodiments the logging client can extract a transaction entry from a transaction queue in response to determining that a core wrote to the transaction queue. In this embodiment the logging client may or may not make a determination as to whether the transaction entry is stored in the heap before extracting the transaction entry from the transaction queue and storing the transaction entry in the heap . Upon extracting the transaction entry the logging client can chronologically store the extracted transaction entry into the heap which includes a chronological list of transaction entries.

For example the logging client can determine that a core or packet engine wrote a transaction entry to a transaction queue on that core and responsive to making that determination the logging client can extract the transaction entry from the first transaction queue. In some embodiments the extracted transaction entry can be the transaction entry written to the transaction queue while in other embodiments the extracted transaction entry can be a transaction entry in the transaction queue that has the earliest timestamp. Upon extracting the transaction entry the logging client can then chronologically store the extracted entry into the heap . In a further example the logging client can again determine that another core wrote a transaction entry to a transaction queue on that other core . Upon making this determination the logging client can extract this other transaction entry from the other transaction queue and can chronologically store the other transaction entry in the heap . In some embodiments the other transaction entry can have a timestamp that is later than the timestamp of the first transaction entry stored to the heap . In these embodiments the logging client can store the other transaction entry chronologically in accordance with the timestamp of the first stored transaction entry. For example if the original or first transaction entry had a timestamp of 10 01 11 and the other transaction entry had a timestamp of 11 10 00 then the logging client can store the other transaction entry behind the first transaction entry. In each of these examples a transaction entry from one core is stored chronologically according to the timestamp of a transaction entry from another core . Thus the heap can store the transaction entries generated by each core in chronological order regardless of which core generated by the transaction entry.

Illustrated in is one embodiment of a method for extracting entries from the global heap and adding them to a web log. The web logging client can extract a transaction entry from the heap where that transaction entry has the earliest timestamp out of all the transaction entries included in the heap Step . The web logging client then writes the extracted transaction entry to the log file corresponding to the filter which matches the extracted entry Step and inserts the head of the transaction queue corresponding to the extracted entry into the global heap Step .

Further referring to and in more detail in one embodiment the web logging client extracts the earliest transaction entry from the global heap Step . The earliest transaction entry can be the entry having the earliest timestamp. Extracting the earliest transaction entry can include copying the earliest transaction entry and writing the transaction entry to a log file. Extracting the earliest transaction entry can also include copying the earliest transaction entry and removing the earliest transaction entry from the global heap .

Upon extracting the earliest transaction entry from the global heap Step the web logging client can write the transaction entry to a log file that corresponds to a transaction filter or other filter that matches the transaction entry Step . In some embodiments web logging client can write the transaction entry to a web log buffer before writing the transaction entry to a log file. In other embodiments the web logging client writes the transaction entry to a web log buffer corresponding to a filter that matches the transaction entry. For example the web logging client can write a response record to a web log buffer or log file corresponding to a response record filter. In another example the web logging client can write a request record to a web log buffer or log file corresponding to a request record filter. In still another example the web logging client can write transaction records and their corresponding response and request record to a log file corresponding to a transaction filter while the web logging client can write abort records to a log file corresponding to an abort filter.

In some embodiments the interval between extracting a first transaction entry from the global heap and extracting a second transaction entry from the global heap can be chosen to ensure that all transaction entries bearing timestamps that lie within a certain time interval are sorted in the same attempt. This interval is therefore chosen such that the transaction entries that are delayed in transit are also accounted for. Thus the first transaction entry can correspond to a time T however the web logging client does not write the first transaction entry until a time T x where x is a predetermined period of time. Similarly the second transaction entry can correspond to a time T2 however the web logging client does not write the second transaction entry until a time T2 x where x is the predetermined period of time. This predetermined period of time can be any period of time in the range of 0 ms. to 100 ms. For example the first transaction entry can correspond to 5 20 01 PM however the web logging client does not write the first transaction entry until 5 20 02 PM a period of time equal to 60 ms. By inducing a time lag between when an entry occurs and when an entry is logged the system can correct for transmission delays.

Once the transaction entry is written to the log file the web logging client can identify a transaction queue associated with the transaction entry and can insert the head of the corresponding transaction queue into the global heap Step . In some embodiments the web logging client can identify a core ID of the transaction entry and can then identify a transaction queue on the corresponding core. Once the transaction queue is identified the web logging client can extract the transaction entry in the transaction queue that has the earliest timestamp and insert that transaction entry into the global heap . When there are no entries in the corresponding transaction queue the web logging client can skip Step . The transaction entry in the transaction queue having the earliest timestamp is the head of the transaction queue therefore extracting the head of the transaction queue and inserting it into the global heap can comprise any embodiment of Step illustrated in .

For example a first transaction entry is removed from the global heap and written to a log file corresponding to the first transaction entry. The first transaction entry has a core ID of five corresponding to a fifth core in the multi core system . Upon writing the first transaction entry to a log file the web logging client then queries a transaction queue associated with the fifth core for a transaction entry having the earliest timestamp. When the transaction queue is empty the query returns a null value and the method ends. However when the transaction queue is not empty the web logging client retrieves the transaction entry having the earliest timestamp deletes that transaction entry from the transaction queue and adds the transaction entry to the global heap .

In some embodiments each of the packet engines generating transaction entries and storing them in a core specific transaction queue can approximate timestamp synchronization across the packet engines by using a shared timestamp value. This shared timestamp value can in some embodiments ensure that the granularity of chronological ordering is in synch with the granularity of the system timestamps. Illustrated in is one embodiment of a method for providing timestamp synchronization for transaction entries across multiple cores of the multi core system. A packet engine executing on a core can acquire a lock on a shared memory Step . Upon acquiring the lock the packet engine can allocate memory from the shared memory to a timestamp variable Step and then release the lock Step . When subsequent packet engines acquire a lock on the shared memory for the purpose of allocating a timestamp variable these packet engines can determine that a timestamp variable was already created and can then retrieve a current timestamp value from the timestamp variable Step .

Further referring to and in more detail the packet engine can acquire a lock on a share memory element Step such as any shared memory element. In some embodiments the shared memory element can be a global cache or shared memory bus such as those described herein. The packet engine in some embodiments can acquire a lock on the shared memory element for the purpose of trying to obtain a timestamp value. In some embodiments obtaining a timestamp value can include generating a timestamp variable. When the packet engine acquires the lock the packet engine prevents all other packet engines in the multi core system from writing to a memory element in the shared memory. Thus only the packet engine that acquired the lock can allocate memory to variables and write values to the allocated memory. By acquiring a lock on the shared memory element prior to generating a timestamp variable the packet engine can ensure that no additional packet engine may create a timestamp variable at the same time or substantially the same time. Thus the packet engine ensures that only one timestamp variable can be created.

Upon acquiring a lock on the shared memory element the packet engine can allocate memory to a timestamp variable Step . In some embodiments the packet engine can first determine whether a timestamp variable exists or is stored in the shared memory element. Determining whether a timestamp variable exists can include searching the memory registers of a shared memory element for a timestamp variable and based on the search determining whether the variable exists. Upon determining that a timestamp variable does not exists the packet engine can allocate memory to a timestamp variable. In some embodiments a packet engine can allocate memory to a timestamp variable in response to acquiring a lock on the shared memory element. Allocating memory to the timestamp variable can include writing a timestamp variable to a section of shared memory or marking one or more memory addresses or a range of memory addresses as a timestamp variable by storing a marker in those addresses indicating that those addresses have been allocated to a timestamp variable.

In one embodiment the process of creating a timestamp variable can include allocating a shared memory element for a thirty two bit timestamp variable the shared memory element which is accessible by each packet engine executing within the multi core system and in some embodiments accessible by each service process object or element within the multi core system . Each packet engine at any given time can attempt to lock onto the shared memory element for the purpose of writing to that memory element. When a packet engine acquires a lock on the shared memory element that packet engine allocates the shared memory element for the timestamp variable and is henceforth responsible for incrementing the timestamp variable according to a clock or other time keeping mechanism. In some embodiments the packet engine is henceforth responsible for incrementing the timestamp variable in the packet engine s ns netio loop. In still other embodiments incrementing the timestamp variable can include storing a microsecond second nanosecond or other unit of time in the timestamp variable thereby causing the value of the timestamp variable to increment according to the time unit stored in the variable. The packet engine linked to the timestamp variable can increment the timestamp variable at any point in time and in some embodiments can increment the timestamp variable after another packet engine obtains the value of the timestamp variable.

After the packet engine allocates the shared memory element the packet engine in some embodiments releases its lock on the shared memory element Step . The lock in some embodiments can be released in response to allocating memory to the timestamp variable. Releasing the lock can in some embodiments include issuing a notice to all packet engines that the shared memory element is available.

In some embodiments when other packet engines attempt to acquire a lock on the memory element those packet engines can read a flag or other indicator indicating that a memory element has already been allocated and subsequently can release their lock on the timestamp variable. Upon releasing their lock the other packet engines can read the contents of the shared memory element e.g. the timestamp variable and use that variable to update the transaction queue. Thus in some embodiments other packet engines can receive or be provided with timestamp values stored in the timestamp variable Step . In some embodiments the other packet engines can read the contents of the shared memory element and store them in their corresponding ns netio loop. In one embodiment each packet engine can use the contents of the shared memory element e.g. the timestamp variable in the web logging records that they can store in their transaction queue and send to the web logging client . The web logging client can then use these common timestamp values to compare transaction entries when sorting through transaction entries. In some embodiments this process can occur multiple times to ensure a consistently updated timestamp value. In other embodiments the timestamp variable or shared memory element can be updated by the packet engine that acquired the first lock on the shared memory element by storing a microsecond timestamp in the shared memory element. This packet engine can continue to update the timestamp variable.
