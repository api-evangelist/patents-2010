This is a 371 national phase of PCT JP2010 001806 filed 12Mar. 2010 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a vehicle in particular a vehicle that a rider can safely get on off.

For example as disclosed in Patent literatures 1 and 2 vehicles that perform a turning movement based on the rotation of the step plate on which the rider rides to the left or right have been known. In particular the vehicle disclosed in Patent literature 1 includes a vehicle main body having a parallel linkage including left and right vertical links and top and bottom horizontal links. Further a step plate is provided on the upper end of each of the left and right vertical links. Note that the vehicle disclosed in Patent literature 2 includes inclination detection means to detect the relative inclination angle of the step plates with respect to the vehicle main body as a movement in the left right direction.

Incidentally the vehicle disclosed in Patent literature 3 performs a turning movement based on the rotation angle of a handle bar that is rotatably provided on the step plates.

The vehicles disclosed in Patent literatures 1 and 2 have such a configuration that the step plates rotate in the left right direction. Therefore when a rider takes such a posture that only one foot is put on a step plate as the rider tries to get on the step plates or get off the step plates the step plates could rotate. Thus the vehicle becomes unstable state.

The present invention has been made to solve the problem like this and an object thereof is to provide a vehicle capable of maintaining a stable state when a rider gets on the step plate or gets off the step plate.

A vehicle in accordance with the present invention is a vehicle that performs a turning movement based on a rotation of a step plate on which a rider rides in a left right direction including restriction means to allow the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction to be restricted. With the configuration like this when a rider gets on the step plate or gets off the step plate the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted by the restriction mechanism. As a result the rider can get on the vehicle or get off the vehicle in a stable state.

The vehicle preferably further includes first control means to control the restriction means so that the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted when the rider gets on the step plate or the rider gets off the step plate.

The vehicle preferably further includes first detection means to detect a rotation angle of the step plate and second detection means to detect a load exerted on the step plate wherein the first control means preferably starts getting off assist control in a state where the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is permitted when determined that the step plate is in a roughly horizontal state based on the rotation angle of the step plate detected by the first detection means controls the restriction means so that the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted and when determined that the rider has gotten off the step plate based on the load exerted on the step plate that is detected by the second detection means finishes the getting off assist control in a state where the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted and the first control means preferably starts getting on assist control in a state where the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted when determined that the rider has gotten on the step plate based on the load exerted on the step plate that is detected by the second detection means controls the restriction means so that the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is permitted and finishes the getting on assist control in a state where the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction is permitted.

The vehicle preferably further includes first operation means that is operated by the rider to perform a turning movement of the vehicle and second control means to control a wheel either in a turning mode of the vehicle based on an operation of the first operation means or in a turning mode of the vehicle based on a rotation of the step plate in the left right direction.

The second control means preferably makes switching to the turning mode of the vehicle based on the operation of the first operation means available when the restriction means is restricting the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction.

The vehicle preferably further includes second operation means that is operated by the rider to make the restriction means restrict or permit the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction.

The vehicle preferably further includes a vehicle main body that supports the step plate wherein the vehicle main body is a parallel linkage capable of rotating in a left right direction the parallel linkage including top and bottom horizontal links and left and right vertical links and a step plate being disposed on an upper end of each of the left and right vertical links and the restriction means restricts the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction by restricting a rotation of the vehicle main body.

The restriction means preferably includes a restriction piece that protrudes under control of the first control means the restriction piece being disposed near a connecting portion between the horizontal link and the vertical link and being configured so that the protruded restriction piece comes into contact with the horizontal link or the vertical link and thereby restricts a rotation of the vehicle main body in a left right direction.

The vehicle preferably further includes a vehicle main body the vehicle main body being connected to the step plate through a rotation shaft so as to permit a rotation of the step plate in a left right direction wherein the restriction means restricts the rotation of the step plate in the left right direction by restricting a rotation of the rotation shaft.

In accordance with the present invention it is possible to provide a vehicle capable of maintaining a stable state when a rider gets on the step plate or get off the step plate.

A vehicle according to a first exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings. As shown in a vehicle includes a vehicle body wheels wheel drive units a support member and a restriction mechanism . The vehicle is an inversion control type coaxial two wheel vehicle.

As shown in the vehicle body includes a parallel linkage and step plates . The parallel linkage serves as the vehicle main body. The parallel linkage includes two horizontal links disposed on the upper side two horizontal links disposed on the lower side and two vertical links disposed on the left and right sides. A shaft receiving hole is formed in the middle portion in the longitudinal direction of the horizontal link . The shaft receiving hole penetrates the horizontal link in the forward backward direction. A shaft receiving hole that penetrates the horizontal link in the forward backward direction is also formed in each of the left and right end portions of the horizontal link . These two horizontal links are disposed so as to sandwich the upper end portions of the vertical links at both end portions of the two horizontal links .

The horizontal links have a similar configuration to that of the horizontal links . These two horizontal links are disposed so as to sandwich the lower end portions of the vertical links at both end portions of the two horizontal links .

Each of the vertical links is composed of a flat plate member. A shaft receiving hole is formed in each of the upper and lower end portions of the vertical link . The shaft receiving hole penetrates the vertical link in the forward backward direction. These vertical links are disposed between the vertically arranged two horizontal links and and two horizontal links and at their end portions. Further the shaft receiving holes of the vertical links are disposed on the same axial centerlines as those of the shaft receiving holes of the horizontal links and . Further turning support pins are inserted in such a manner that they pass through these shaft receiving holes in a reciprocal manner. As a result the horizontal links and and the vertical links are formed as a parallel linkage that can rotate in the left right direction of the vehicle . Incidentally the horizontal links and are connected with each other by means of a restoration member such as a spring so that the parallel linkage is restored from a state where the parallel linkage is rotated in the left right direction of the vehicle to the original state that is so that the vertical links are restored from an inclined parallelogram state to the rectangular state.

The wheel drive units are attached on the exterior surfaces of the vertical links . Each of the wheel drive units can be constructed for example from an electric motor a series of reduction gears that are coupled to the rotation axis of the electric motor so that the power can be transferred from the rotation axis to the reduction gears and the like. Each of the wheel drive units is composed of a fixed portion fixed to the vertical link and a rotating portion that is supported on the fixed portion so that the rotating portion can freely rotate. The wheels are attached to the respective rotating portions. In this way the left and right wheels which are supported on the respective vertical links through the respective wheel drive units are disposed in such a manner that their rotation centers are aligned on the same axial centerline when the vehicle is placed on a flat road surface.

Further the upper end portions of the vertical links protrude upward from the upper surfaces of the horizontal links . Step plates are horizontally attached on the upper end surfaces of the respective vertical links . Specifically as shown in the left and right step plates are disposed on the upper end portions of the vertical links in such a manner that when the left and right feet of a rider are put on the left and right step plates the weight of the rider is exerted on the parallel linkage from points located inside the lines N that pass through the ground contact points A of the wheels and are parallel to the vertical links . In this exemplary embodiment the left and right step plates have footrest areas inside the respective lines N. As a result the weight of the rider standing on the footrest areas of the left and right step plates is exerted on the parallel linkage from points located inside the lines N. Incidentally the distance between the left and right step plates may be equal to a distance between both feet of a human when he she stands in a natural state.

As shown in the parallel linkage like this maintains a balanced state when a rider exerts roughly the same weights on the footrest areas of the left and right step plates . In contrast to this as shown in when a rider applies a large downward force with his her foot on the outer side with respect to a turning direction to apply a large weight W on the step plate on that side a rotational force in the left right direction is generated in the parallel linkage . In this state the step plates and the wheels are also tilted rotated in the left right direction in conjunction with the rotation of the parallel linkage .

The handle includes a grip portion having an annular shape as viewed from the top and a support portion for supporting the grip portion from the rear side. The rider can stabilize his her posture by grasping the grip portion during traveling and during a getting on off action. Further for example when a wheel s for transportation is provided on the rear surface of the vertical link of the vehicle body the vehicle itself can be transported by tilting the vehicle backward by grasping the grip portion and dragging the vehicle in a state where the vehicle is supported on the wheel for transportation. The lower end portion of the support portion is connected to the handle bar . The lower end portion of the handle bar is connected to the upper end portion of the handle bar bracket .

The handle bar bracket has such a shape that it straddles the central point of the vehicle body in the forward backward direction. A front portion is provided in front of the handle bar bracket and extends to the lower portion of the vehicle body . Shaft receiving holes are formed in the front portion in such places that they correspond to the central shaft receiving holes of the horizontal links and that are vertically arranged in front of the vertical links . The shaft receiving holes in the front portion are disposed on the same axial centerlines as those of the central shaft receiving holes of the horizontal links and . A turning support shaft is inserted so as to pass through the shaft receiving holes in a reciprocal manner.

A rear portion is provided behind the handle bar bracket and extends to the lower portion of the vehicle body though its illustration is omitted in the figure. Shaft receiving holes are formed in the rear portion in such places that they correspond to the central shaft receiving holes of the horizontal links and that are vertically arranged behind the vertical links . The shaft receiving holes in the rear portion are disposed on the same axial centerlines as those of the shaft receiving holes of the horizontal links and . A turning support shaft is inserted so as to pass through the shaft receiving holes in a reciprocal manner. Further the turning support shafts disposed in the front and rear portions are disposed on the same axial centerline.

When the parallel linkage is rotated in the left right direction the support member having the configuration like this is also rotated in conjunction with the rotation of the parallel linkage . That is the support member is maintained in parallel with the vertical links of the parallel linkage .

To detect the rotation angle tilting angle of this support member an angle detection sensor first detection unit is provided in the connecting portion between the parallel linkage and the handle bar bracket . As the angle detection sensor for example a potentiometer a sensor having a variable capacitor structure or the like can be used. This angle detection sensor can detect the tilting angle of the handle bar bracket with respect to the horizontal links of the parallel linkage by using a feature that the electrical resistance of the angle detection sensor varies according to the amount of rotational displacement.

Incidentally in the vehicle shown in a storage portion is formed in an area between the left and right step plates and between the front and rear horizontal links and and the front and rear horizontal links and . In this storage portion a battery which is a specific example of the power supply to supply an electrical power to the left and right wheel drive units the control device and other electronic devices and electric devices is stored. Further a drive circuit that drives the left and right wheel drive units and the like a posture detection sensor unit that is posture detection means to detect the posture of the vehicle and to output the detection signal and a vehicle control device second control unit that outputs control signals used to control the driving of the left and right wheel drive units and the like are also stored in the storage portion. Since the heavy objects including the battery are collectively stored in a place directly below the rider who stands on the left and right step plates the concentration of the mass can be achieved and the operatively of the vehicle can be thereby improved.

As shown in the vehicle control device performs predetermined arithmetic processing based on a detection signal from the posture detection sensor unit a detection signal from the angle detection sensor and the like and outputs necessary control signals to the left and right wheel drive units L and R and the like. The vehicle control device includes for example an arithmetic circuit having a micro computer CPU a storage device having a program memory a data memory other RAMs and ROMs and the like. The battery and the left and right drive circuits L and R are connected to the vehicle control device . The left and right drive circuits L and R individually control the rotation speeds the rotation directions and the like of the respective left and right wheels . The left and right wheel drive units L and R are individually connected to the respective left and right drive circuits L and R.

A detection signal from the angle detection sensor that detects the tilting angle of the support member and a detection signal from the posture detection sensor unit are input to the vehicle control device . The posture detection sensor unit is used to detect the angle and or the angular speed of the vehicle in the forward backward direction and thereby to control the angle the angular speed and or the acceleration of the vehicle in the forward backward direction. The posture detection sensor unit includes for example a gyroscopic sensor and an acceleration sensor.

In the vehicle having the configuration like this a rider gets on the step plates and applies a large downward force with his her foot on the outer side with respect to a turning direction to apply a weight on the step plate . As a result the parallel linkage rotates to the left or right while maintaining the parallel state of the opposed links. At the same time the support member also rotates to the left and right in conjunction with the parallel linkage . In this state the angle detection sensor detects the tilting angle of the support member with respect to the horizontal links and and outputs the detection signal to the vehicle control device . Upon receiving the detection signal the vehicle control device performs predetermined arithmetic processing based on the detection signal calculates how much the rotation speed of the wheel on the inner side with respect to the turning direction should be decreased or how much the rotation speed of the wheel on the outer side with respect to the turning direction should be increased and outputs a signal indicating the calculation result to the wheel drive unit . Upon receiving the signal indicating the calculation result the wheel drive unit controls the rotation speed of the motor and thereby drives the wheel based on the signal indicating the calculation result. In this way the vehicle is controlled for its turning movement.

Further in the vehicle the rider gets on the left and right step plates and shifts his her weight forward or backward to tilt the vehicle forward or backward. As a result the posture detection sensor unit detects the forward or backward angle and or the angular speed of the vehicle and outputs the detection signal to the vehicle control device . Upon receiving the detection signal the vehicle control device performs predetermined arithmetic processing based on the detection signal calculates a drive torque necessary to stabilize the vehicle so that the vehicle does not topple over and outputs a signal indicating the calculation result to the wheel drive units . Upon receiving the signal indicating the calculation result the wheel drive units controls the rotation speed of the motors and thereby drives the wheels based on the signal indicating the calculation result. In this way the vehicle is controlled for its inverted state.

In the vehicle having the configuration like this when a rider applies a large downward force with his her foot on the outer side with respect to a turning direction to actively change the weight distribution the parallel linkage constituting the vehicle body the step plates and the wheels work together and tilt to the left or right. As a result the vehicle including the rider works as one piece thus enabling the rider to enjoy operating the vehicle . In addition the vehicle can be brought into a state where the rider can easily cope with centrifugal force during the turning movement. However when a rider takes such a posture that only one foot is on the step plate as the rider tries to get on off the vehicle the step plates could be tilted. Thus the vehicle becomes unstable state.

Accordingly the vehicle in accordance with the present invention includes a restriction mechanism to allow the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction to be restricted. As the restriction mechanism for example a translational actuator or the like can be used. That is as shown in the restriction mechanism translates a restriction piece by using the driving force of a solenoid or the like. However the restriction mechanism is not limited to any particular configurations provided that it can push out or pull in the restriction piece .

The restriction mechanism is disposed near the connecting portion between the horizontal link and the vertical link in the parallel linkage . That is as shown in the restriction mechanism is disposed in an area close to the connecting portion on the inner surface of the left and right vertical links . In this state by pushing out the restriction pieces the restriction pieces come into contact with the lower surface of the horizontal link when the parallel linkage starts to rotate. To be more precise the restriction piece come into contact with the lower surface of the horizontal link at the end portion of the horizontal link located on the opposite side with respect to the rotation direction of the parallel linkage . Therefore when the restriction pieces are pushed out the rotation of the parallel linkage in the left right direction is restricted thereby restricting the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction. The restriction mechanism is controlled by a restriction mechanism control device first control unit . Note that the position of the restriction mechanism is not limited to the above described example. That is the restriction mechanism may be disposed in any place where the restriction mechanism can restrict the rotation of the parallel linkage .

The restriction mechanism control device also includes for example an arithmetic circuit having a micro computer CPU a storage device having a program memory a data memory other RAMs and ROMs and the like. The restriction mechanism control device controls the restriction mechanism so that the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction is restricted when a rider gets on the step plates or gets off the step plates .

Specifically a getting off assist signal for the restriction mechanism control device is supplied from a getting off assist switch to the restriction mechanism control device . The getting off assist switch is operated by a rider when the rider gets off the vehicle . The getting off assist switch is disposed for example in the handle of the support member .

A getting on assist signal for the restriction mechanism control device is supplied from a getting on assist switch to the restriction mechanism control device . The getting on assist switch is operated by a user when the user gets on the vehicle . The getting on assist switch is disposed for example in the handle of the support member .

A load exerted on the step plates is input from a load sensor second detection unit to the restriction mechanism control device . The load sensor detects a load exerted on the step plates . A load sensor is disposed in roughly the same place in each of the left and right step plates .

The tilting angle of the support member is input from the angle detection sensor to the restriction mechanism control device .

The restriction mechanism control device having the configuration like this starts getting off assist control when a rider operates the getting off assist switch and a getting off assist signal is thereby supplied from the getting off assist switch to the restriction mechanism control device . At this point the restriction pieces of the restriction mechanism are in a retracted state and therefore the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction is permitted.

The restriction mechanism control device determines whether the parallel linkage is in a roughly non rotated state or not i.e. whether the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state or not based on the tilting angle of the support member . When the tilting angle of the support member is roughly zero degrees the restriction mechanism control device determines that the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state. Therefore the restriction mechanism control device controls the restriction mechanism so as to push out the restriction pieces .

Note that the tilting angle of the support member is substantially equal to the tilting angle of the vertical links of the parallel linkage . Further the tilting angle of the vertical links is substantially equal to the tilting angle of the step plates . Therefore the determination whether the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state or not that is made based on the tilting angle of the support member is equivalent to the determination whether the step plates are in a roughly horizontal state or not that is made based on the tilting angle of the step plate .

The restriction mechanism control device determines whether the rider has gotten off the vehicle or not based on the load exerted on the left and right step plates . When no load is exerted on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device determines that the rider has gotten off the vehicle and thereby finishes the getting off assist control while maintaining the restriction pieces in the pushed out state. As a result the step plates are restricted from tilting to the left or right.

Further the restriction mechanism control device starts getting on assist control when a rider operates the getting on assist switch and a getting on assist signal is thereby supplied from the getting on assist switch to the restriction mechanism control device . At this point the restriction mechanism control device had finished the getting off assist control with the restriction pieces being in the pushed out state as described above. Therefore at this point the pushed out state is maintained and the step plates are thereby restricted from tilting to the left or right.

The restriction mechanism control device determines whether or not the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates based on the loads exerted on the left and right step plates . When roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device determines that the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates . Therefore the restriction mechanism control device pulls in the restriction pieces to finish the getting on assist control. As a result the step plates are permitted to tilt to the left and right. Therefore as shown in the rider can turn the vehicle based on the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction.

In the vehicle having the configuration like this when a rider gets on the step plates or gets off the step plates the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction is restricted by the restriction mechanism . Therefore the rider can get on or get off the vehicle in a stable state.

Incidentally the control of the restriction mechanism is preferably combined with the turning control and the inversion control of the vehicle as shown below. In this case as shown in the getting off assist signal from the getting off assist switch the getting on assist signal from the getting on assist switch and the load exerted on the step plates and detected by the load sensor are also input to the vehicle control device in addition to the restriction mechanism control device .

Firstly a getting off assist control performed when a rider gets off the vehicle is explained with reference to .

When the rider operates the getting off assist switch a getting off assist signal is supplied from the getting off assist switch to the vehicle control device and the restriction mechanism control device . As a result the vehicle control device and the restriction mechanism control device start getting off assist control. Upon receiving the getting off assist signal the vehicle control device terminates the turning control among the above described turning control and inversion control S .

Upon receiving the getting off assist signal the restriction mechanism control device determines whether the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state or not based on the tilting angle of the support member detected by the angle detection sensor S .

When the restriction mechanism control device determines that the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state the restriction mechanism control device controls the restriction mechanism so as to push out the restriction pieces and thereby to restrict the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction S . As described above the restriction mechanism control device confirms that the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state. Therefore the rotation of the parallel linkage in the left right direction can be reliably restricted when the restriction pieces are pushed out.

The restriction mechanism control device determines whether the rider has gotten off the vehicle or not base on the load exerted on the left and right step plates that is detected by the load sensor S . When no load is exerted on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device determines that the rider has gotten off the vehicle and thereby finishes the getting off assist control of the restriction mechanism control device while maintaining the restriction pieces in the pushed out state. Then the restriction mechanism control device outputs a signal indicating that the getting off assist control has finished to the vehicle control device . Upon receiving the signal indicating that the getting off assist control of the restriction mechanism control device has finished the vehicle control device finishes the inversion control and finishes the getting off assist control of the vehicle control device S . In this way the getting off assist control of the vehicle has finished.

As described above since the tilting movement of the left and right step plates in the left right direction is restricted when a rider gets off the vehicle the rider can get off the vehicle in a stable state.

Next a getting on assist control performed when a rider gets on the vehicle is explained with reference to .

When the rider operates the getting on assist switch a getting on assist signal is supplied from the getting on assist switch to the vehicle control device and the restriction mechanism control device . As a result the vehicle control device and the restriction mechanism control device start getting on assist control. Upon receiving the getting on assist signal the vehicle control device determines whether a foot is put on at least one of the step plates or not based on the load exerted on the step plates and detected by the load sensor S .

When the vehicle control device determines that a foot is put on at least one of the step plates the vehicle control device determines whether the vehicle is in a roughly horizontal state in the forward backward direction or not based on the angle and the angular speed of the vehicle in the forward backward direction that is detected by the posture detection sensor unit S .

When the vehicle control device determines that the vehicle is in a roughly horizontal state in the forward backward direction the vehicle control device starts inversion control S . Then the vehicle control device outputs a signal indicating the start of the inversion control to the restriction mechanism control device .

Upon receiving the signal indicating the start of the inversion control the restriction mechanism control device determines whether the feet of the rider are put on the left and right step plates based on the load exerted on the left and right step plates and detected by the load sensor S .

When the restriction mechanism control device determines that the feet of the rider are put on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device further determines whether or not the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates based on the loads exerted on the left and right step plates and detected by the load sensor S .

When the restriction mechanism control device determines that the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device controls the restriction mechanism so as to pull in the restriction pieces and thereby to permit the tilting movement of the left and right step plates in the left right direction. Then the restriction mechanism control device finishes the getting on assist control of the restriction mechanism control device S .

The restriction mechanism control device outputs a signal indicating that the getting on assist control has finished to the vehicle control device . Upon receiving the signal indicating that the getting on assist control has finished the vehicle control device starts turning control and finishes the getting on assist control of the vehicle control device S . In this way the getting on assist control of the vehicle has finished.

As described above since the tilting movement of the left and right step plates in the left right direction is restricted when a rider gets on the vehicle the rider can get on the vehicle in a stable state. In addition the vehicle control device starts the turning control after the vehicle control device confirmed that the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates . Therefore it is possible to prevent such a situation that the vehicle accidentally turns to an unintended direction as the rider tries to get on off the vehicle . Further since the restriction is cancelled after the restriction mechanism control device confirmed that the left and right loads are equal to each other it is also possible to prevent such a situation that the vehicle accidentally inclines to the left or right at the moment when the restriction is cancelled.

Note that although the vehicle in accordance with this exemplary embodiment has such a configuration that the rider applies a large downward force with his her foot on the outer side with respect to a turning direction to turn the vehicle it is also possible to employ such a configuration that the rider applies a large downward force with his her foot on the inner side with respect to a turning direction to turn the vehicle as shown in . In such a case as shown in the feet of the rider are put on places that are located outside the lines N that pass through the ground contact points A of the wheels and are parallel to the vertical links .

A vehicle according to a second exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings. Note that part of the explanation that overlaps that of the first exemplary embodiment is omitted.

The configuration of a vehicle in accordance with this exemplary embodiment is roughly the same as that of the vehicle in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment. However as shown in the vehicle in accordance with this exemplary embodiment further includes a joystick first operation unit and a mode select switch . The joystick is operated by a rider to instruct the vehicle to perform a turning movement. The joystick is disposed for example in the handle of the support member . As the joystick any joystick having a typical configuration can be used. When a rider tilts the lever to the left or right an amount of the tilting movement operation signal is output to the vehicle control device . Note that although a joystick is used in this exemplary embodiment other operating devices such as dial type devices may be also used.

The mode select switch is operated by a rider to switch the vehicle between a turning mode based on an operation by the joystick and another turning mode based on the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction. The mode select switch is disposed for example in the handle of the support member . When the rider operates the mode select switch a select signal is output to the vehicle control device . Note that although the tuning mode is switched by using the mode select switch in this exemplary embodiment the mode select switch may be omitted. In such a case when the vehicle control device receives an operation signal from the joystick the vehicle control device brings the vehicle into the turning mode based on the operation by the joystick .

The vehicle control device has a turning mode of the vehicle based on an operation by the joystick and another turning mode of the vehicle based on the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction. The vehicle control device selects either one of the turning mode of the vehicle based on an operation by the joystick and the other turning mode of vehicle based on the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction based on a select signal supplied from the mode select switch and controls the wheels in the selected turning mode. With this configuration the rider can select the turning mode of the vehicle based on an operation by the joystick or the turning mode of vehicle based on the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction as appropriate depending on the usage and or the place of the vehicle. Needless to say the rider can get on or get off the vehicle in a stable state by operating the getting off assist switch and the getting on assist switch as with the first exemplary embodiment.

It is preferable that the vehicle control device allows the vehicle to be switched to the turning mode based on the operation by the joystick only when the restriction mechanism is restricting the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction. With this configuration the step plates always become a roughly horizontal state before the vehicle is switched to the turning mode based on the operation by the joystick . Therefore the operability of the vehicle can be improved.

It is also preferable that vehicle includes an action instruction unit second operation unit that controls the push out action or the pull in action of the restriction pieces of the restriction mechanism so that the rider can easily change the turning mode while the vehicle is traveling. The action instruction unit is disposed for example in the handle of the support member . When the rider operates the action instruction unit the action instruction unit outputs an action instruction signal to the restriction mechanism control device to instruct the restriction mechanism to push out or pull in the restriction pieces .

When the restriction mechanism control device receives an action instruction signal to instruct the restriction mechanism to push out the restriction pieces it determines whether the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state or not based on the tilting angle of the support member detected by the angle detection sensor . Further when the restriction mechanism control device determines that the parallel linkage is in a roughly balanced state the restriction mechanism control device pushes out the restriction pieces based on the action instruction signal to restrict the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction. At the same time the restriction mechanism control device outputs a signal indicating that the restriction piece is in a pushed out state to the vehicle control device .

Further when the restriction mechanism control device receives an action instruction signal to instruct the restriction mechanism to pull in the restriction pieces it determines whether or not the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates based on the loads exerted on the left and right step plates and detected by the load sensor . When the restriction mechanism control device determines that the rider is riding on the vehicle in such a manner that roughly the same loads are exerted on the left and right step plates the restriction mechanism control device pulls in the restriction pieces based on the action instruction signal.

In this way a rider can restrict or permit the tilting movement of the step plates in the left right direction by operating the action instruction unit even when the vehicle is traveling. Therefore the rider can switch the turning mode in a stable state even when the vehicle is traveling.

A vehicle according to a third exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings. Note that part of the explanation that overlaps that of the first or second exemplary embodiment is omitted.

The fundamental configuration of a vehicle in accordance with this exemplary embodiment is the same as that of the vehicle in accordance with the first or second exemplary embodiment. However as shown in a step plate is connected to a vehicle main body through a rotation shaft . The vehicle main body serves as a housing in which for example the vehicle control device the restriction mechanism control device and the battery are stored. The wheels are connected to the vehicle main body through drive units. On the upper surface of the vehicle main body jigs protrude from roughly the center in the left right direction. At least two jigs are disposed with a space therebetween in the forward backward direction. A rotation shaft disposed in the forward backward direction of the vehicle main body passes through the jigs .

The rotation of the rotation shaft is restricted by a restriction mechanism . As the restriction mechanism for example a magnetic brake can be used. However any configuration capable of restricting the rotation of the rotation shaft can be used as the restriction mechanism . Similarly to the first exemplary embodiment and the like the restriction mechanism is controlled by a restriction mechanism control device. The step plate is connected to the vehicle main body through this rotation shaft in such a manner that the step plate can tilt in the left right direction.

The step plate is formed as one plate member. The step plate is connected to the vehicle main body through the rotation shaft . Load sensors are disposed on the left and right sides on the upper surface of the step plate .

With the configuration like this this exemplary embodiment can be implemented in roughly the same fashion as that of the first and second exemplary embodiments even though the step plate is formed as one plate member. Note that although the tilting movement of the step plate is restricted by restricting the rotation of the rotation shaft in this exemplary embodiment it is not limited to this configuration. That is translational actuators may be disposed on the left and right sides under the step plate as a restriction mechanism. Then the translational actuators may be extended to come into contact with the lower surface of the step plate so that the tilting movement of the step plate in the left right direction is restricted. In short any configuration capable of restricting the tilting movement of the step plate in the left right direction can be used as the restriction mechanism .

Note that the present invention is not limited to the above described exemplary embodiments and various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example although the vehicle in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment does not include the action instruction unit it may include the action instruction unit. In such a case the getting on assist control that is performed when a rider gets on the vehicle is performed in accordance with the flow shown in . That is after the rider put his her feet on the left and right step plates the rider operate the action instruction unit to pull in the restriction pieces of the restriction mechanism S .

The vehicles in accordance with the first to third exemplary embodiments are merely examples. The present invention may be applied to any vehicles that perform a turning movement base on the tilting movement of the step plate in the left right direction.

A vehicle in accordance with the present invention is used as a vehicle that a rider can safely get on off.
