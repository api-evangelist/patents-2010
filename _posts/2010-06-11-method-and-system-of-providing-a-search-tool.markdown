This disclosure is related to and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 275 864 inventor Scott A. Jones et. al. entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING UTILIZATION OF HUMAN SEARCHERS filed Nov. 21 2008 claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 219 219 inventor Michael B. Burroughs entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM OF PERSONALIZING RESPONSES TO USERS filed Jun. 22 2009 U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 186 067 inventor Scott A. Jones entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM OF IMPROVING TARGETING OF ADVERTISEMENTS filed Jun. 11 2009 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 219 739 inventor Jeffrey Jockish et. al. entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM OF PROVIDING SEARCH TOOLS filed Jun. 23 2009 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Various embodiments described herein relate to search engine technologies and more specifically to human assisted search engines. A method and system of providing tools for human searchers is described.

In a system where human guides are used to process queries from users human judgment may greatly increase the ability to respond to natural language and arbitrary questions from users. This flexibility has allowed services such as ChaCha and Any Question Answered AQA to find general acceptance. However such systems are generally presented with the difficulty of being broadly accepted when a user must pay to use the service. For example after more than five years of operation AQA had answered approximately twenty two million questions. Conversely the advertising supported ChaCha service answers over thirty million questions per month.

However being an advertising supported service requires a highly efficient infrastructure in order to respond to queries at a cost consistent with the advertising revenue which can be obtained. For this reason a multi tiered approach to responding to a request may be implemented. Initially a query may be parsed and processed automatically in order to determine whether the query is a match to an existing query and response which is available or if the query may be answered automatically using an automated resource. However such automated matching may have limitations. In many instances a human may be able to rapidly recognize the meaning of a request in context while machine matching may have a low confidence factor or may be entirely incorrect. For this reason it is effective to use human judgment in processing queries which are not recognized by an automated system. However this approach generally increases cost.

In order to solve this and other existing problems it may be that an intermediary may be provided where a query may be received and interpreted in order to improve efficiency of a subsequent search by clarifying intent of a request or query and directing the query appropriately.

The tools available to an intermediary are critical to rapid and effective processing of a query. If a toolset is complex the intermediary may spend more time than required which may cause frustration and dissatisfaction.

For these and other reasons a set of tools for improving performance of processing of a search request would be greatly appreciated.

A method and system of providing a search service is disclosed herein. A method of an embodiment includes receiving a request automatically determining a type of the request received and providing a portion of the request to a human assistant in an interface selected based on the type.

An embodiment provides a method and system configured to improve a response rate of a user to advertising using a message delivered to the user. Another embodiment provides a search service where a response to a request is customized to a user submitting the request.

Additional aspects and or advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.

These together with other aspects and advantages which will be subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.

Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments discussed herein examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the disclosed system and method by referring to the figures. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope is thereby intended such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device and such further applications of the principles as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the embodiments relate. As used herein words importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa unless specifically counter indicated.

It may be that an intermediary expediter or ambassador guide may be provided including to process a query request . The expediter may receive a query and interpret the query in order to improve efficiency of a subsequent search by clarifying intent of a request or query and directing the query to a searcher based on a categorization appropriate to the query. In addition an expediter may process a query in order that it may be answered by an automated process such as a data feed a matching to a database a query to a search engine etc. As an expediting task may be performed rapidly and a high percentage of queries may be answered automatically the expediter s role may improve customer experience and reduce the total cost to process a query. As further described in U.S. Published Patent Application 2009 0132500 Titled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING UTILIZATION OF HUMAN SEARCHERS inventor Scott A. Jones et. al. the query vetting process may have various processes which are performed by the expediter.

The tools available to an expediter are critical to rapid and effective processing of a query. If a toolset is complex the expediter may spend more time than required which may cause frustration and dissatisfaction for the expediter and a user submitting the request. A toolset may provide a list of potentially matching queries to an expediter but this may not offer sufficient context. An expediter may be required to transcribe a query which may cause a loss of efficiency due to time spent typing and correcting typography. A transcriber may be required to change a tool being used in order to use an available resource to provide a response to a query. As questions are generic and arbitrary an expediter may have difficulty to respond to common queries with ad lib commentary which may waste time and damage user experience.

A system and method are provided whereby a user may submit a query to a search service. A query may be submitted using any type of messaging service which is available to a user and a search system. A query is initially processed automatically to determine whether a search result may be obtained. A query may be modified and processed to determine whether the query is a match to a query stored in a database of queries and answers. A query may be modified and processed to determine whether an automated response based on information obtained from a resource such as a data feed an RSS feed etc. Natural language processing which may include stemming named entity analysis categorization etc. may be performed.

If it is determined that a response to a query is not available information of the query may be provided to a human who is assigned to provide a response to the query with a limited search for information who may be referred to as an expediter. An expediter is provided with a rich toolset which may allow the expediter to rapidly categorize a request create a well formed or succinct query obtain a response to many sorts of queries rapidly or perform any processing with respect to the query.

An expediter toolset provides access to resources which can deliver an automated response with minimal action by the expediter and are classified for rapid retrieval and use. An expediter toolset provides an interface to resources which may rapidly formulate a request and send a response without the need for typing or other forms of search activities by an expediter. An expediter toolset provides a quick review of any search queries and results matching a query constructed by an expediter. An expediter toolset may provide information of search results associated with a query in order to provide context information to an expediter. An expediter may send a query to a searcher or guide even if a matching query exists in the search database if the expediter considers the current answer is unsuitable for any reason.

A system and method are provided whereby a human searcher or guide may more efficiently respond to a user request. A query is received from a user and may be analyzed automatically to determine whether a response may be provided based on automated processing. If it is determined that automated processing may not provide a response a request or query may be directed to an expediter. An expediter may be a guide trained to process a query to determine context and to direct the query to an appropriate resource. If it is determined that a guide who is trained to search for information or searcher is required to respond to a request a query processed by an expediter may be routed to a searcher. A searcher may be a specialist searcher who searches for information associated with a specific class or category of information and or may be a generalist searcher who has registered to respond to requests of any type. Any guide may perform any type of role or task as described herein.

An expediter may be provided with a toolset which allows the expediter to respond to a request more rapidly. If a query is determined to correspond to a particular type of information request an expediter responding to the request may be automatically provided with an interface appropriate to the type of request. Presentation of a most likely query interface may reduce an amount of time and effort required to process a request. A query processing interface may allow an expediter to transfer information regarding a query to fields associated with further processing of the query more efficiently. In at least one embodiment any word s identified in an interface may be transferred to a field which may include the attention pointer by a mouse click. A query associated with an automated resource may be answered by activation of a completion control without further action by an expediter. An interface appropriate to a type of automated response may be provided automatically to an expediter and or may be selected by an expediter.

If a query is determined to be associated with a generalized or conversational response an expediter may be provided with an interface which provides access to responses associated with generalized queries. An expediter may be able to select common types of responses which may be delivered without the need for the guide to provide a response composed by the guide. In at least one embodiment a guide may be able to view responses associated with keywords and or categories of a query which may be used to respond to a query. An expediter may be provided with previous responses associated with a keyword which may include any or all of a request. An expediter may select a previous response which may be edited prior to being provided as a response to a query. In at least one embodiment if a response is not an automated response an expediter may be requested to confirm a response.

If a query is determined to be associated with a category and or to be associated with a previous query an expediter may be provided with an interface which may be used to process the query. A query processing interface may include controls which allow an expediter to make various selections including enabling selection of any or all of an original query a succinct or processed query provided automatically and a location associated with a query which may be provided to a searcher. A query processing interface may provide information of queries and or answers determined to match a query which may provide context. A query processing interface may allow an expediter to categorize a query. A query processing interface may provide access to historical information including queries and answers associated with a query. A query processing interface may provide the ability to review queries and answers associated with a modified query. A query processing interface may provide the ability to send a query to a guide if an expediter determines that existing results associated with a query are not suitable for any reason. If an expediter determines that a response to a query may be located using a resource associated with a response to an existing query information of the resource and the response may be provided to a searcher performing a search responsive to a query.

A system and method is provided which allows a user who may be any person or entity to submit a search request search query or request to a search service and receive a response to the search request. A search system which allows communication to occur between a user a searcher or guide a resource and or the search system allows queries to be processed. A database comprising information regarding users guides resources advertisements categories keywords tags content requests search methods and or other information is provided.

A search request or query submitted by a user which may include a keyword a category a fully formed question a statement any type of media implicit data such as information associated with a user identifier and or device which may request a response may receive a response which is produced automatically and or utilizing the assistance of one or more human searchers guides or providers . In at least one embodiment a search request submitted by a user is compared to a database of search requests in order to determine if a matching search request is found. If a matching request is found a search result associated with the matching search request may be presented to a user responsive to a search request.

If multiple search results are associated with a search request the search results may be ranked to determine an order in which the search results will be presented to a user. A ranking of a search result may be based on any type of information associated with the search result or result . A search request is identified and may be assigned a unique identifier. Information such as a category geographic information and or a profile may be selected to be associated with a search request. A request and or any information associated with the request may be presented to a searcher or guide. An indicator of items such as a category keyword key phrase named entity or interests geographic information or time information previous activities or other information associated with a request may be provided to a guide selected to respond to the request. A guide may be selected based on association of a guide with any or all information associated with a reference item. A guide may be provided with information on one or more types of items such as a category a keyword a tag an advertisement a profile or any sort of content which a guide may elect to associate with a request and or to transmit to a user. An interest or keyword is any type of information which may be associated with a request and or other information for the purposes of this disclosure. While text based searching may use words phrases or other elements other forms of information might also be utilized in a search. For example if a request indicated visual audio or other types of media which may be compared to any elements of a resource such elements or atoms might be used individually and or in combination to rank and or rate an item.

A guide who may be any person may be associated with or registered for one or more keywords topics and or categories. A guide may be associated with any information required by a search system in order that a guide may be identified and may be registered for one or more keywords categories or topics. In at least one embodiment a guide may be required to establish a login account and or provide information which may be used to establish communication with the guide. A guide who is associated with a category may be provided with access to a resource which may include content and or other information which may be indexed in order that it may be searched to obtain a search result utilizing a resource. Content and or resources indicated in a database associated with a category may be compared to keywords and or other information associated with a request in order to rank a category which may be presented to a user and or a guide in order to assist in obtaining a search result. Likewise content associated with a request may be used to determine whether a matching request exists which may be presented to a user and or may be used to provide a result or response to the user.

A database of information associated with a category or topic and or a keyword may be created using various methods. A database may be created and or modified by a human editor or taxonomist who may be able to create associations between categories. A database of information associated with a category may be created and or modified based on information obtained from a database such as DMOZ or any database which may include and or indicate resources which may be included in the database. A database of information associated with a category may be created and or modified based on information indicated in a search session log. A guide and or a user may be able to associate information with a category. For example a wiki of any sort may be associated with a category. A guide and or user may have various rights to add remove and or review information which may be associated with a category or node defined within a database which may be based on information associated with a guide and or user such as rating or ranking information.

A search facility may be associated with a category. For example a custom search engine may be associated with a category which may be customized by a person who may be a guide which may be used to locate information related to the category. A search facility may be dynamically updated in order to search any or all information associated with any or all categories indicated in a database. A database may be created and or modified which may be used to modify the performance of a custom search tool.

A user request is received and may be compared to a database of queries. If an exact match and or an indexed exact match is identified a result associated with a matching query may be returned to a user. If a suitable match is not identified a guide may be selected. Any or all information associated with a query may be compared to information associated with an index or taxonomy. For example keywords of a request may be compared to keywords or interests associated with an index of categories. Likewise geographic information associated with a request such as an area code zip code street address or GPS coordinates etc. may be compared to a database of locations which may include names of places which are ranked according to proximity to the geographic information. If there is not a suitable match to information associated with a query with information in a selection index and in at least one embodiment universally a search may be conducted of resources in order to obtain information of a keyword such as a rating or ranking and or other information which may be associated with the index.

A user is any person or entity which may submit a request or search request. A request search request or query is any request for information which may be originated by a person and or a device or system. A user may be referred to as a requester information seeker or InfoSeeker .

A guide is any person who may be compensated and or may be a volunteer who may respond to and or assist with a request. An ambassador or expediter is a guide who may perform processing of a request and or a search result. A searcher is a guide who may perform an information search responsive to a request. A transcriber who may also be a guide may convert a spoken portion of a request into text and or may otherwise convert information of a request from one form to another. For example a transcriber may translate correct and or analyze any or all of a request. A guide may be referred to as a human assistant human searcher or searcher . A guide may perform any type of task. Any guide may act in any guide role. However a human assistant who performs a task associated with a request and a guide who conducts a search responsive to the request may not necessarily be the same person. For example a human assistant may perform a task to facilitate a search which is conducted by another person who is registered as a guide.

An identifier or ID may include character number and or other types of information which may be used to identify an item including items of a database. Items may include but are not limited to a guide a user a resource an advertisement a keyword a category a search result a search request a query a rating a ranking a message and or a profile.

Using the example illustrated in Guide has the rating Guide has the rating and Guide has the rating associated with Category . This may indicate that the guide Guide has the highest rating and might be selected first to respond to a request associated with Category . For example if it is determined that searcher is to perform a search responsive to a request associated with Category Guide might be notified of the request before other searchers. A rating of a guide may be determined based on any information indicated in the database . In at least one embodiment a rating of a guide associated with a categorization is based on a quality rating of search results provided by the guide responsive to requests associated with the category.

The categorization keyword ID field may include information of one or more keywords associated with the categorization indicated in the categorization record ID field . The information indicated in the categorization keyword ID field may be compared to information indicated in a search request in order to associate a request with a category. In at least one embodiment if a keyword is associated with a content of a request a ranking of a category associated with the keyword may be increased which may make the category more likely to be associated with the request. If a keyword indicated in a query is a match to a keyword indicated in the categorization keyword ID field the category may be presented to a guide or an expediter responding to a request. Any number of keywords may be associated with a categorization. Content of the categorization keyword ID field may be determined based on activities of guides users system administrators etc. Using the example in the keywords Little John Polly LJ n Polly BadDog and SlickRay are associated with Category which may cause Category to be more likely to be associated with a request including those keywords.

The categorization advertisement ID field may include one or more identifiers associated with an advertisement. The categorization advertisement ID field may include one or more identifiers of an advertisement which may be associated with a categorization. Using the example in Advert and Advert have been associated with the categorization record which may indicate that the advertisements Advert and Advert may be presented to a guide and or a user responsive to a request associated with Category . While only a few advertisement identifiers have been illustrated in any number of advertisement identifiers may be associated with a categorization.

The categorization advertisement rating field may include information of one or more ratings associated with an advertisement. For example the categorization advertisement rating field may include a rating of an advertisement based at least in part on the frequency of selection of an advertisement by a guide responsive to search request associated with the categorization identified in the categorization record ID field . In at least one embodiment the categorization advertisement ID field and the categorization advertisement rating field may be linked by for example a pointer. Using the example illustrated in the rating has been associated with Advert and the rating . has been associated with Advert . This may indicate that Advert has the highest rating and might be more likely to be selected responsive to a request associated with Category .

The categorization resource ID field may include one or more identifiers of a resource which may be associated with a categorization. Using the example in the resources Resource Resource and Resource have been associated with Category .

In operation an expediter usage function is calculated. A process and functionality for determining a probability that an expediter is to be used to respond to a search request is further described herein with respect to . Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether an expediter is required to process a request. If in operation it is determined that an expediter is required to process a request control is passed to operation and process continues. If in operation it is determined that an expediter is not required to process a request control is passed to operation and process continues. Determination of whether an expediter is required in operation may be made based on various factors including but not limited to subject matter of a query complexity of the query form of the query etc.

In operation an expediter processes a query a request . Processing of a request by an expediter is further described herein.

In operation a searcher performs a search for information. A searcher may be selected based on any suitable criteria. In at least one embodiment a highest ranking searcher associated with a category associated with a request is selected and provided with search resources associated with information of the request such as a category keyword location profile etc. In at least one embodiment resources may be provided to a guide using a system and method such as those described in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 223 642 titled METHOD AND SYSTEM OF PROVIDING SEARCH TOOLS inventor Jeff Jockish attorney docket 1918.1075P filed Jul. 7 2002 in the US Patent and Trademark Office. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

For example the process may be operative on the user system . In at least one embodiment the process is operative on a server associated with the search system . An NLP process or other similar process may also be referred to as an analyzer.

In operation signature stripping is performed. Some queries such as SMS MMS email or IM based queries may include template information which must be removed in order to effectively determine user intent. For example a user may have a signature message which is added to an email or SMS message. As this is easily detected by a person if an expediter identifies this content in a first message subsequent messages may have the identified content removed without the use of an expediter. Likewise standard email signatures which contain elements such as phone numbers etc. might be detected and removed from a request message. Signature removal may be based on statistical analysis of known signatures. For example if a high percentage of known signatures begin with a particular character presence of that character in multiple user messages may be used to determine a probability that a character string is a signature. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation language detection is performed. Various types of language detection algorithms may be applied. For example International Conference on Computational Linguistics Proceedings of the 18th conference on Computational linguistics Volume 2 Saarbr cken Germany SESSION Project notes and demos Pages 1021 1025 Year of Publication 2000 or A composite approach to language encoding detection S. Li K. Momoi Proc. 19th International Unicode Conference 2001 sfr fresh.com describes a typical algorithm for language detection. As the search system may recognize an individual user and individual queries may typically have a length of seven to nine words a language recognition process might be applied over a query history and or may be influenced by factors such as profile information area code country code etc. which may be associated with a user. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a spelling check is performed. Spelling check is performed including using well known techniques such as word comparison and phrase comparison based on the language detected in operation . If language detection results were ambiguous a spelling check versus more than one dictionary may be performed and the language detection may be repeated based on results of the probable spelling corrections. In at least one embodiment a dictionary may be selected based on a profile of a user. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a grammar check is performed. Grammar check is performed using well known techniques e.g. an annotation graph . For example ATLAS A flexible and extensible architecture for linguistic annotation Steven Bird David Day John Garofolo John Henderson Christophe Laprun Mark Liberman submitted on 13 Jul. 2000 describes a software tool for producing and using annotation graphs. An annotation graph may be constructed using a grammar specialized to queries rather than a generalized sentence analysis optimized for text processing. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a word substitution is performed. Word substitution is a process of replacing common abbreviations and or slang forms of speech with an alternate form of the word or words. For example b4 might be replaced with before or u might be replaced with you etc. Such a process may include factors which may be tailored to a user based on factors such as profile information e.g. regional information demographic etc. and or query history information etc. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a query is formatted as a structured query. Such a process may be performed by semantic processing of a query. In at least one embodiment a query may be created by converting a statement into a question such as rewriting the query will it rain today. as what is the chance of rain today . Likewise a raw query might be compared to a database of raw queries which have been associated with a succinct query by a guide. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation categories associated with a query are rated. An exemplary algorithm for selecting and rating a categorization associated with a query is The Ferrety algorithm for the KDD Cup 2005 problem Zsolt T. Kardkov and Domonkos Tikk and Zolt SIGKDD Explorer Newsletter volume 7 number 2 2005 issn 1931 0145 pages 111 116 ACM New York N.Y. USA and Technical Report LU CSE 07 013 Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering Lehigh University Bethlehem Pa. 18015. entitled Leveraging Search Engine Results for Query Classification by Bhandari and Daivson published 1 Nov. 2008. The search system may have a taxonomy for categorization which is customized in order to index the guide community. Training of a classification algorithm based on query classification information provided by guides may be used. For example keywords which are most frequently associated with a particular category may be determined based on content of queries categorized by guides. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation automated and or keyword based queries may be excluded from processing. In at least one embodiment if a keyword is associated with a particular system response a query which begins with that keyword may be excluded from processing. Excluded queries might include advertising keywords. Likewise a query which conforms to a query template after NLP may be selected for an automated response. For example if a user submitted the query wether 46038 a corrected version weather 46038 would be automatically processed. Likewise a query such as stok nfs which might be corrected to stock nfs could be automatically processed. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation named entity processing is performed. Named entity processing techniques are well known in the art. For example Memory Based Named Entity Recognition by Erik P Tjong Kim Sang from the 6Conference on Natural Language 2002 describes an exemplary process and method for performing named entity processing. In particular the search system may access a database of named entities which may be included in the database and or may be an external search resource. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation information associated with the NLP operations performed in conjunction with the process is recorded. For example a record of NLP processing may be stored in the database . This information may include results of the processes the confidence and or probability factors associated with various versions of a query etc. which may be shared with other processes and or may be used to evaluate training and efficacy of a particular parametric tuning etc. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation information associated with a query is updated and process completes. A request record such as the request record may be updated to reflect categorizations a structured query keywords and or ratings information determined based on the process . Control is passed back to a parent process such as the process .

As previously discussed answer reuse is important to the success of a human assisted search system as it directly impacts cost and economic viability of the system. In order that a previous search result may be provided responsive to a request it is necessary to meet a combination of conditions. A request must be sufficiently close to a request for which a search result is available and the available search result must be of sufficient quality. Criteria for matching and the criteria for quality of a search result may change based on the nature of a request and a type of search result.

For example a search resource an advertisement a game an answer contact information for a supplier of items or services etc. may have different quality criteria. Quality rating of a resource might be based on the reliability of a resource providing information. Quality rating of an advertisement might be based on fit with a category and or payment by an advertiser. Quality rating of a game might be based on a match to keyword and or profile information associated with previous purchases.

Similarly to the quality rating matching to a query may have different criteria for different types of search results. For example a search result such as an advertisement might be provided if matching is less exact while a search result such as an answer to a question might be provided if matching is more exact. To determine whether an answer is to be reused a function which describes the level of matching between a query and a reference query with which a search result is associated is needed. In at least one embodiment software which implements the evaluation is referred to as the Answer Reuse Process ARP and an ARP evaluation function is used to determine whether an answer is to be reused.

In at least one embodiment a process which provides a set of queries which match a vetted query and answers associated with the queries is implemented. The Query Vetting Process QVP compares any query to a database of queries and returns any queries which match the reference query to a given threshold. For example the QVP might return all queries which matched any word in a query or any queries that match 80 of the words in a query etc. Techniques such as stemming etc. may be utilized by the QVP and the algorithm may be adjusted to provide a manageable set of queries and associated answers to the ARP. It should be noted that queries may be returned based on a ranking of the queries versus a reference query. This a set of returned queries is a best available match to a reference query but is not rated as regards the absolute or normalized matching of the set of returned queries to the reference query. A normalization process may be used to determine whether stored query is a sufficiently close match to a reference query.

In at least one embodiment the ARP evaluator function which determines the probability that a search result will be reused is defined as Eq. 1 Wherein a q is the ARP answer rating for a potential answer a with respect to the query q . The answer rating function is normalized such that it is a value between zero and one inclusive. In other words 0 a q 1

 a is a quality rating associated with the answer awith respect to the query qthat is associated with the answer a. The quality function fis normalized such that it has a value between zero and one inclusive. In other words 0 a 1

 q q is the Query Match Function defined below which rates the similarity between the reference query q and the query associated with the answer q. The match function fis normalized such that it has a value between zero and one inclusive. In other words 0 q q 1.

An answer ais selected which has the highest value of ffor the set of answers which are associated with queries which are provided to the ARP by the QVP. If the value of fassociated with the selected answer ais below a threshold the answer will not be reused. Thus the probability that an answer will be reused is a function of both the match between a query e.g. a vetted query a raw query etc. and the query associated with the answer and the quality rating associated with the answer and its related query.

The Answer Quality Function AQF f may be determined in various ways. For example an answer which has been selected by a highly rated searcher may have a high value of f. An answer which has received a high percentage of positive ratings by users and or guides may have a high value of f. An answer which has been provided by an automated search may have a low value of f. In at least one embodiment a discrete value function may be used to assign f 1 for a reviewed superior answer provided by a guide f 0.7 for an answer which has received at least 80 positive ratings by users and f 0.5 for an answer which has been selected by at least one expediter. The AQF may include other variables such as how often a result has been provided to users time based modification sponsorship factors adjustment for characteristics of a searcher etc. In at least one embodiment selection of an answer by an expediter may increase a value of fassociated with an answer. A Query Matching Function QMF is used to determine how closely related a test query is to a reference query. The QMF may be based on any information associated with a query such as a category a structured query a raw query a profile a location a language etc. In at least one embodiment the QMF is defined as 

The reference query q is the query which is to be matched from Eq. 1. In at least one embodiment q is a succinct query which has been produced by the NLP process . The category set Cis the set of categories that have been selected to be associated with the reference query q. In at least one embodiment Cis the set of categories which have been determined by the process . The candidate answer ais an answer which is associated with a set of vetted queries which has been selected for evaluation. In at least one embodiment the queries and answers are provided by the QVP. The candidate category set

The QMF includes the weighting factors w w and w. In order to preserve normalization it will be readily appreciated that the values of f fand fmust be between zero and one inclusive and that w w w 1. The components of the match function fare the Wordbag Function WBF the Phrasebag Function PBF and the Autocat Function ACF . The WBF is used to compare words and their grammatical functions between two queries. The PBF is used to compare phrases and their grammatical functions between two queries. The ACF is used to compare categories between two queries.

In at least one embodiment the ACF compares the tagged word content of the reference query q and the query associated with the answer a qusing the following formula 

The Phrasebag Function PBF is similar to the Wordbag Function WBF but the PBF utilizes word phrases instead of words. Wis the set of tagged phrases in the reference query q. A tagged phrase is a group of words along with a tag which identifies the part of speech associated with the group which has been determined from semantic analysis of context of the query e.g. noun phrase prepositional phrase etc. . Tagged phrases are considered to be identical if both the phrase content and the associated tag are identical.

The WBF and the PBF may include consideration for synonyms and other word relations as well as the frequency of various tagged phrases.

That is to say if the intersection of the set of categories associated with queries returned by the QVP with the set of categories returned by the RWP is null the value of the ACF is zero. If there are categories in the intersection the highest rating value of any category in the intersection is selected. The rating value associated with the selected category is modified by the smoothing function f.

Actions of guides and or users responsive to results produced by an NLP process may be used to tune various elements of the performance of the NLP algorithms. For example data of acceptance of a structured query by expediters may be used to determine a weighting given to words and or phrases when constructing a structured query. Similarly language detection named entity processing spelling correction etc. may be modified based on actions of guides. Such activities may for example allow NLP speech recognition and or other forms of automated conversion of requests to be personalized to a user without the need for a user to make such corrections.

As illustrated in a process for determining whether a reusable search result responsive to a request is available is provided. The process may be operative on any suitable elements of the system . In at least one embodiment the process is operative on a server associated with the search system .

In operation a parameter for the reuse evaluation function such as those described herein above are determined. For example if the answer reuse function is to be evaluated in operation the parameters and or the decision thresholds may be adjusted due to the lack of human intervention in the processing of the query. Likewise if a guide such as an expediter searcher and or transcriber has processed a query the parameters and or thresholds may be modified. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a number of succinct queries and categories which are associated with a raw query are obtained. In at least one embodiment the QVP may provide such information to the ARP. Succinct queries may be selected based at least in part on content of search results associated with the succinct queries. For example a ranking of succinct queries may be based on a reverse index of the queries associated with keywords of the succinct queries. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a number of succinct queries and categories which are associated with a query produced by NLP operations such as those performed in the process are obtained. In at least one embodiment the QVP may provide such information to the ARP. Succinct queries may be selected based at least in part on content of search results associated with the succinct queries. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation the ARP evaluation function is evaluated for the set of answers associated with the structured queries and categories obtained associated with a raw query and a vetted query. In at least one embodiment the queries from obtained based on a raw query are weighted differently than the queries obtained using a vetted query. In particular if a structured query and a category have been determined by a guide and or a user results associated with a raw query may be more or less likely to be selected. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether a search result which may be reused is available. If in operation it is determined that a search result which may be reused is available control is passed to operation and process continues. If in operation it is determined that a search result which may be reused is not available process ends and control is passed back to a parent process. As previously noted if a category associated with a search result associated with a test query is not related to a category associated with a reference query the reuse function of the search result may be decreased.

In at least one embodiment the determination in operation is made based on a threshold determined in operation . If more than one search result exceeds a given value of the ARF evaluation function various actions may be taken. These various actions may include selecting an answer with a highest value providing all the answers providing a randomly selected member of the qualifying answers etc.

In operation an available answer is provided. Control is passed back to a parent process and process ends.

As illustrated in a process for determining whether a request is to be directed to an expediter or ambassador is provided. The process may be operative on any suitable elements of the system . In at least one embodiment the process is operative on a server associated with the search system .

In operation a function is evaluated which measures the probability that a category selected to be associated with a request. A function such as the ACF described herein above may be utilized. A category confidence value may include factor s such as user history user profile guides associated with a user subject matter of category etc. In at least one embodiment the ACF is applied to a raw query and a succinct query created using the process . Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether an expediter is required to select a category to be associated with a request. If in operation it is determined that an expediter is required to select a category to be associated with a request control is passed to operation and process continues. If in operation it is determined that an expediter is not required to select a category to be associated with a request control is passed to operation and process continues. For example a value of the ACF associated with a query may be compared to a pre determined threshold value to determine whether an expediter is needed to select a category associated with a request.

In operation a function which measures the probability that a programmatic response from a search resource may be used to respond to a request is evaluated. For example a query may be analyzed to determine if it may be mapped to an API available to provide information such as weather sports scores etc. Likewise keywords of a request may be examined in order to determine the probability that a response from an expediter can be used. In at least one embodiment a function such as the ARF evaluation function may be applied to a query structure associated with a resource and a query. In at least one embodiment a query may be processed by a plurality of processes associated with automated resources. A parallel processing of queries associated with multiple resources may reduce an amount of time required to determine a probability that a query may be processed by an automated process. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether an expediter may provide a response to a request using a resource i.e determine whether there is an acceptable auto guide probability . If it is determined that an expediter may provide a response to a request using a resource control is passed to operation and process continues. If it is determined that an expediter may not provide a response to a request using a resource control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a function which measures the matching between a succinct query and a request is evaluated. In at least one embodiment a function such as the Query Match Function equation 2 may be evaluated to determine if a succinct query indicated in the database matches a user request which may include a succinct query. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether a matching succinct query is known available . If in operation it is determined that a matching succinct query is available control is passed to operation and process continues. If in operation it is determined that a matching succinct query is not available control is passed to operation and process continues. For example if a query in the database is a match to a query but an answer associated with the query is of low quality it may be determined that the query may be sent to a searcher without processing by an expediter.

In operation a function which measures the sensitivity of a request to location is evaluated. For example a user request may include words which imply location such as here there etc. or might include named entities such as street names city names etc. a location sensitivity function may be affected by such content. Likewise queries including named entities associated with sports teams restaurants etc. might have a high location sensitivity function. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether a query is location sensitive. If in operation it is determined that a query is location sensitive control is passed to operation and process continues. If in operation it is determined that a query is not location sensitive control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation information of a request is provided to a searcher. As a query has been appropriately prepared by the preprocessing it is not necessary for an expediter to respond to the request. A searcher may be selected based on a categorization succinct query and or other information associated with a request. It should be noted that the cost of processing a query may be reduced as a searcher may be responding to well formed queries in the searcher s area of interest while an expediter is not utilized if it is not needed. Control is passed back to the parent process and process terminates.

In operation information of a request is provided to an expediter. As a query has been evaluated to determine the nature of the request an expediter may be selected more effectively. An expediter may further be provided with a toolset which is adapted to the most likely response to a query. As such an expediter may be able to process a request more rapidly and or with fewer errors. In at least one embodiment an expediter is automatically provided with a GUI based on pre processing of a query. In at least one embodiment a keyword location category profile etc. with a query may affect a GUI initially provided to an expediter. Control is passed back to the parent process and process terminates.

If a user elects to respond a user may send a negative response message from a user device . If the negative response message is received by the search system the search system may respond with a negative incentive message . The affirmative incentive message and the negative incentive message may include an incentive content i.e. the poll results but an affirmative advertising content may be different from a negative advertising content .

If a user elects not to respond to the interactive activity message the user may receive an interstitial advertising message . The users of the user device and the user device may receive the interstitial advertising message may receive a different interstitial advertisement and or may not receive an interstitial advertisement. The search system may provide a search result message responsive to the query message .

The messaging sequences described in and are used for the purposes of illustration. Additional types sequences and combinations of messages and or communication services which may be utilized to implement the messaging will immediately occur to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art and are included within the scope of the disclosure herein.

Using the methods and system described herein a user is presented with an interactive activity responsive to a search request. If a user elects to respond to an interactive activity the user is rewarded with an incentive. A user response may be used to improve targeting of information to the user which may improve performance of advertisements delivered to a user. At least some of interactive activities provided to a user may include a specific commercial targeting. If a user responds affirmatively to the targeted interactive activity the user may receive an incentive and may receive an advertisement targeted to the response of the user. As a user has expressed a specific interest in a merchant in question a probability of a user response to the advertising may be greatly increased.

A user may receive interactive messages relating to topics which are determined to be of interest to the user based on various criteria including a profile of a user user historical queries queries from other users etc. A user profile may be determined based on responses and or lack of responses to an interactive activity which is offered to a user. Information of responses to an interactive activity may be provided to advertisers for purposes such as improving targeting of advertisements bidding on placement of advertisements understanding preferences by parameters such as geographic demographic affiliation personality and or other traits and characteristics.

A search system maintains a database of users advertisers search queries search results search resources guides and other information which allows the search system to index and rank interactive activities or pings in order that targeting of the pings may be achieved. A search system may collect and aggregate user responses which may be used to provide incentives to users such as polling information comparative scoring of users etc. relating to a topic of a ping. User responses may be parsed according to location demographics etc. in order to provide incentives which may be of more specific interest to any user. A sequence of pings may be used to provide an interactive experience which may present advertising and or other messaging responsive to a sequence of actions. In this way a user preference may be elicited within a context which may be more palatable to the user. For example advertisements might be presented in a gaming context whereby an advertisement is associated with a particular event within the game.

Using the methods and systems described herein efficacy of advertising delivered to users by a search system is enhanced. An interactive activity is used to determine user interests which allows for better assessment of user intent and advertising opportunities while reducing unwanted noise.

In a human assisted search system it is important to maintain a human touch for responses to users. However if a human searcher is required to respond to each query the cost of a personalized response may be high. Further a human responder may add an unpredictable personalization message. For example if a user requests a sports score and the responder is a fan of the opposing team the personalized response may not be aligned with the expectations of the user or may simply be neutral based on the selection of a guide or human responder which may be unrelated to the characteristics of the user. The most cost effective means to respond to a user request is an automated response which may be based on recognition of a user query and matching to a database of previously answered queries or a data feed which may provide an answer. However such a methodology produces a formulaic response which may be easily perceived as an automated reply which defeats the human touch objective.

In some instances a programmatic response is appended to any computer generated result. Such responses are naturally limited and lack variation and personalization as the content of a query and or a response to the query does not affect the message which is provided to the user responsive to the query. Likewise if a blended response wherein a person interprets a query and passes the query to an automated resource is produced the automated result provided to the user lacks the personality of the guide who responded to the query.

In light of the above and other problems a system and method for providing a personalized search result to a user which is based on characteristics of the user the search result and a guide associated with the search result would be greatly appreciated.

If a request is received by a search system a determination may be made regarding whether a search result may be provided using any form of automatic response. For example if it is determined that query matches a previous query it may be determined that a search result may be supplied automatically. If it is determined that an automated result may be provided a personalization process may be applied to the result based on a resource associated with the result. A profile which may include previous search requests search results etc. which are associated with a user submitting a query may be analyzed in combination with content of the query and a search result in order to personalize the search result. Personalization of a search result may include appending a short comment which is selected based on processing of content of the search result information of a user and information of a query. If a search result is produced from an automated resource such as a data feed or RSS feed content of the search result provided to a user may be based on the resource associated with the search result and information of a query. If a search result is produced by a human assistant or guide content of the search result provided to a user may be based on information of the guide and information of a query.

A neural network or other form of learning algorithm may be used to define any or all content of a search result provided to a user responsive to a query or search request. Inputs to a neural network may be determined based on comments provided by guides associated with a category keyword resource profile advertiser or other information which may be associated with a query. A learning algorithm may be trained using information derived from interactions between guides and users.

A method and system of improving user experience in a human assisted search system is described. The disclosed method and system allows a search system to provide a personalized response to a user by utilizing interconnecting characteristics determined by the search system to be used. A search request or query may be processed automatically and or utilizing the assistance of a human assistant.

A query is compared to a database of queries to determine whether a search result which may satisfy the query is available. If it is determined that a search result is available a personalization process is applied to the search result which may be based on information of the search result a query and or a user associated with the query. In at least one embodiment a fixed length message is reserved for a personalized comment which is derived from neural network based processing of a category and or keywords of a search result and a query and profile information associated with a user submitting the query. In at least one embodiment keyword based queries which are formatted to trigger an automated response may be modified using personalization processing. For example if a user requests a horoscope using a keyword a response may be selected based on gender of the user time of day and a location associated with the user.

A first responder or expediter guide may perform operations which may include formulating and or selecting a query which conforms to a specified grammar or structured query based on information associated with a search request categorizing a search request interacting with a user to obtain information relating to a search request reviewing available search results and or searchers determining the scope of a request determining the time frame for a response providing individual personalization to a request and or other additional information associated with a request.

If an expediter determines that an automated search result may be provided to a user the search result determined by the expediter may be modified using personalization processing. For example if an expediter determines that a user is seeking weather information a search result including the weather information may be produced automatically and subsequently modified using a neural network output which is based on information of a user and content of the search result. Information of an expediter may be used to personalize a search result. For example if an expediter is female a search result may be different than if the expediter is male. Alternately a user may indicate a preference which may override characteristics of an expediter. This feature may be used in various ways. For example if a user designates a preference for a young male guide to respond to a request automated and or expedited responses might be personalized to fit that profile. Similarly in order to avoid redundant use of identical personalized responses characteristics of guides may be used as inputs to a statistical processor which chooses a personalization response. As the guide may be selected in a pseudo random manner characteristics of guides may allow the system to maintain a diversified response without the need to necessarily track previous responses provided to a user.

Subsequent to processing by an expediter it may be determined that a search is to be performed by a guide responsive to query. If a guide provides a search result the search result may be modified using personalization processing. For example a comment which was not provided by the guide may be added to a result or content of a result may be modified etc. Thus a specialist guide may produce a search result but is not required to provide a friendly comment to the user as the system may provide the needed personalized commentary.

A personalization processor may be associated with any type of search result. In at least one embodiment a personalization processor may be associated with a search resource which produces a search result. Personalization processing may be customized based on reference training sets. In at least one embodiment profile information associated with guides queries associated with guides users guide comments and auxiliary data based on historical searches is provided in order to determine an algorithm used by a personalization to process a search result provide to a user.

In at least one embodiment guide comments generated by a personalization process may be provided in place of an original comment by a guide. In at least one embodiment user preferences may be used to determine a profile which may be used to personalize a search result. In at least one embodiment advertisements may be modified by a personalization processor. A profile of an ambassador guide who has produced a search result may be used as an input to a personalization processor. A random number generator which may be associated with a user may also be applied to a profile associated with a personalization processor.

Use of a personalization processor may be optional or mandatory. A personalization processor may assist a guide in selecting a comment and or response which may reduce time required for a guide to respond to a request or query.

In operation a result is personalized. For example slang such as textisms colloquialisms etc. which may affect content of a response may be inserted based on a profile associated with a searcher a user and or a resource which may have been used to obtain a search result. A personality snippet associated with a guide who obtained a result may be removed and or a personality snippet associated with a different person may be inserted. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a determination is made as to whether any information and or response or personalization determined during a search session may be used for training the personalization system. If it is determined in operation that information is not used for training control is passed to operation and process continues. If it is determined in operation that information is used for training control is passed to operation and process continues.

The determination in operation may be made based on various criteria. For example if a profile of a guide matches a profile created as a system model for personalized responses a personality snippet produced by the guide and a search result associated with the response may be stored as a training set. Likewise if a guide has a high rating or ranking a personality snippet from the guide may be used and or may be given a higher weighting in training of a personalization system. In at least one embodiment user opinions may be used to determine if a personalization response is to be used to train a personalization system. For example if a user indicated a positive reaction to a personality snippet the personality snippet may be given higher weight in training a personalization system targeted to the user and or users with a similar profile to the user. A user reaction may be judged in various ways. In at least one embodiment if a user responds to an advertisement and or other information associated with a result personalization information associated with the result may be given a higher weight. Likewise if a personalization of an interactive activity elicits a response a user profile associated with the personalization and the personalization instance may be used as a training set.

In operation a personalization system is trained. For example a neural net response may be modified based on a new training set. For example if a guide has added a personality snippet to a response to a user request the personal comment may be added to a database of personality snippets and an association between a profile associated with the guide and the personality snippets may be increased in a neural network used to personalize a result. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a result is sent to a user. For example a result may be provided to a user device which has submitted a request. Any number of search results may be provided to a user by any communication device and or service associated with the user. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation information of the process is recorded. In at least one embodiment information of use of a personalization response may be recorded. Information of an expediter a searcher a search result a category a keyword a request and or a user may be recorded. For example if a user received a customized response information of the response a user action a revision of a personalization algorithm etc. relevant to the response may be recorded in the database . In at least one embodiment a user rating of a response may be recorded which may be used to determine future behavior of a personalization process and system.

In operation input information for a personalization process is obtained. A search result which may be produced automatically information of a user associated with a search request information of a guide who may be an expediter associated with a request and or a user and information of a resource used to obtain a result may be obtained. For example a sports score might be obtained from a data supplier which might be available in a predefined format. A profile of a user based on information provided by a user or inferred from user actions location queries answers purchases etc. may be analyzed based on information associated with a resource which provided a result. For example if a geographic profile of a user indicates that the user lives in Boston a personalization system might use that factor for personalizing a response to a sports query but might not consider such an input for a result associated with a horoscope request yet still might consider such an input for a weather report. A profile of a guide might be used to select a male or female comment or a geographic comment etc. In particular if a previous personalization was selected to have a male bias a current personalization might be selected to have a female bias or a personalization might be selected to weight a profile of an ambassador guide or expediter in personalizing a response. Further in an embodiment the personalization inputs are obtained in accordance with profile information of the user that is adjusted or modified in light of current data supplied by the user. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a processor related to a resource is selected. In at least one embodiment a neural network is selected based on a resource which has produced a search result. A neural network may be developed for a type of automated resource which may provide a search result responsive to a request by a user. For example a neural network which personalizes a response based on a stored result produced by a guide might be designed to provide a comment with a pre determined length. A personality snippet might be selected based on a guide profile associated with a randomly selected guide a guide type for which a user had expressed a preference or a user. In the case of a sports score feed a neural network might customize all of a response. For example substitution of names of sports teams modification of presentation of a result such as the order of team names and or a style of reporting a score might be determined by a personalization process as will be further described herein. A neural network may be a modular element in order that it may be updated without interrupting use of a current model while a new model is developed. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation input variables to a personalization processor and weighting associated with the inputs are determined. For example if elements of a user profile are known with high certainty the elements may be given greater weight or if a user has preferred responses from a type of guide a profile of a guide may be given higher weighting. Factors such as time of day user location and or other information associated with a request may be selected and weighted. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation a personalized response is determined responsive to an item and personalization information provided.

In at least one embodiment an exact match between a reference output and a computed output is used to determine that an actual output is equivalent to a reference output.

In operation modeling parameters of a personalization processor are adjusted. In at least one embodiment parametric hidden variables of a neural network are adjusted based on results of the comparison in operation . For example if a variable has been adjusted in a positive direction and an error function associated with the variable has increased the variable may be decreased. In at least one embodiment a set of training inputs may be used to perform regression analysis for a neural network or other personalization processor. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

In operation parametric values associated with a personalization processor are recorded. For example hidden variables associated with a neural network used to select a personalized output may be recorded in the database . Local storage in the personalization processor system may be used to record information of a personalization processor. Control is passed to operation and process continues.

An exemplary neural network which may be used as a personalization processor is illustrated in . The neural network may include phrase type inputs personalization characteristic inputs hidden layer factors and an output phrase and an output phrase selector .

The phrase type inputs may for example be a number of guide comments or personality snippets which may be static inputs such as the phrase inputs and . In the example any of four phrases at the phrase inputs may be selected by the output phrase selector based on the values of the characteristic inputs .

The personalization characteristics may be any type of variable input which is used to select a phrase type input . For example the gender characteristic input may be a binary value Male 0 Female 1 the age characteristic input might be quantized in years age 15 0 age 65 1 . Hidden layer factors relate the values of the characteristic inputs to the output phrase . The hidden layer factors may be modified based on training sets provided to the neural network .

In order to train a neural net training sets are provided. A set of input values and a target output value are provided. Hidden layer factors may be varied until the target output is obtained. For example training sets selected to use a selected set of values of each input characteristic may be provided with a corresponding output phrase which will allow the hidden variables to be tuned to provide an expected phrase at the phrase output when a test input is provided at the characteristic inputs .

The following simplified example is used for the purposes of illustration. If the output selector chooses a phrase input input based on a value of the output of a summation of the age input and the gender input the hidden layer factor might have a multiplier i.e. G of 0.5 associated with normalized age and the hidden layer factor might have a multiplier i.e. G of 0.5 associated with gender. In this way if the gender is 0 male phrase is selected for young and male phrase is selected for old and male phrase is selected for young and female and phrase is selected for old and female. The hidden layer factors and i.e. Tp Tp and Tp select a threshold applied to the output of the summation which may be initially set to 0.25 0.5 0.75. The hidden layer factor may be applied to vary the sensitivity of the output selector. The hidden layer factors may be initialized to the exemplary values but training sets may be used to modify the multipliers and the thresholds. Thus a neural network may self adjust based on training sets which might for example change a multiplier and or a threshold used in the hidden layer. For example if the inputs are constructed as normalized to use age fifteen as the minimum or zero input level and age sixty five to the maximum or one input level i.e. age 40 was the initial change between phrase and phrase it may be that the neural net modifies the hidden layer factor which controls the threshold Tp applied to the output of the summation to be higher or lower based on the training sets. For example if a male age thirty training set and a male age thirty five training set had the target output phrase the threshold Tp might change from 0.25 to 0.15 responsive to the training sets. In this way the neural net has learned that males over thirty should receive the phrase phrase input rather than the phrase phrase input which would have been selected with the initial values of threshold variable Tp

Using the personalization processor a search result identified based on stored information a data feed database etc. might have a phrase appended to it based on a profile associated with the request. For example if Result. indicated in the request record is a response to a previously answered query any guide comment associated with Result. might be removed. A profile i.e. Profile may be applied to the inputs of the personalization processor and the phrase at the phrase output may be appended to Result. prior to presentation to a user. Similarly if Advert permitted personalization a version of Advert adapted based on Profile associated with Request may be presented as a personalized interstitial response in operation .

While a simple example has been used for the purposes of illustration no limitation is implied. It is expected that multiple inputs and variable phrase types may be utilized as further described herein. A personalization functionality might employ various types of neural networks and or multiple networks in order to process a result for personalization. For example a first personalization process might be used to select a grammar construction for a response and a second process might be used to select elements of the response such as vocabulary colloquialisms slang etc.

A block diagram of an exemplary personalization processor for sports results is illustrated in . The personalization processor receives input variables which includes a category a profile of a user a profile of a guide content of a result and auxiliary information such as calendar information. In this example the category Sports i.e. Category has been associated with the query What is the score of the Boilers game such as was illustrated with respect to the request record . The result provided by Resource is provided to the personalization processor at

The personalization processor may include a pattern sentence selector a presentation order selector a named entity usage selector and an idiom type selector . The named entity selector may be influenced by factors associated with a user and or responder profile. A named entity may include various nicknames associated with for example a sports team e.g. the Cleveland MLB team might be the Indians the Tribe etc. . A more avid sports fan as indicated in a profile of a user might prefer a particular named entity designation of a sports team to be used in a response. The presentation order selector may determine an order of presentation of team names in a sports score. For example a favorite team of a user associated with a profile may be presented first regardless of an order of presentation by a resource. Using the example in the score of Purdue might be provided first because previous requests included Purdue or Boilers even if Resource provided Purdue as the second team in a game result. The pattern sentence selector may determine a sentence pattern to be used to construct a response. For example a sentence pattern may be influenced by a result and profile information wherein a close but favorable result to a user might select a first pattern while a wide margin and an unfavorable result might select a different pattern. Similarly a different set of sentence patterns might be selected based on gender age etc. The idiom type selector may be used to determine whether to modify grammar and or usage. For example age gender and or geographic profile information may influence whether textisms such as u r or BFF or intentional artifacts such as y all may be used in a response.

Returning to Request illustrated in the request record if it is determined that a search result may be produced based on information provided by Resource the scores for you personalization processor associated with Resource may be provided with a search result i.e. Result. produced by Resource . The profiles User and Guide might cause the named entity selector to be set to on the order selector might be set to Purdue the narrow margin and the sports fan profile of User may cause the pattern sentence selector to select the xxx won a tight one over yyy sentence construction and the idiom type selector might be set to off . In such an instance the processor output would be The Boilers won a tight one over the Wolverines 88 85 which might have a guide comment added subsequently by a processor such as the personalization processor . Factors such as time between a result being final and a current time might influence for example the pattern sentence selector .

While a few personalization processor examples have been illustrated other types of personalization processors for stored and or automated information will readily occur to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art and are within the spirit and scope of the disclosure herein. For example a personalization processor for stock quotes might use pattern sentences which might use named entities for companies sentences influenced by value changes and previous requests etc. a personalization processor for movie times might use pattern sentences influenced by show times locations box office reviews time between releases etc. a personalization processor for weather reports might utilize sentence patterns based on time of day location of a user comparative weather in a guide location etc. A personalization processor may be created organically using a generalized neural network and selected queries and answers produced and or reviewed by guides. In such an instance an arbitrary personalization processor may be created for any resource which may produce results in a prescribed format. While the processing blocks and personalization processors are depicted as separate elements any elements of a personalization processor may be implemented as hardware software and or as a combination thereof.

While a single Finder functionality has been illustrated using the GUI any number of GUI s for providing an automated answer may be provided. The personalization processor may process any search result in order to personalize the result.

An exemplary sequence of personalized responses to a user request is illustrated in . A personalized response may be delivered to one or more user devices and or services. A text message embodiment is used for purposes of illustration but the method and system may be applied to any types of messages and or media.

User devices are any device which may originate a request for information. The user device may be associated with a user who is known to be a Purdue fan. The user device may be associated with a user who is known to be a Michigan fan. The user device may be associated with a user who does not have an NCAA basketball team preference. Preferences may be determined from a profile.

The user device may submit a request message . The request message is processed by a search service which may return an advertisement message . The advertisement message may be targeted based on a keyword and or profile associated with the request message . A search result responsive to the request message is obtained. For example the score and participants of the Purdue game may be obtained from a data feed which is determined with or without assistance from a guide. A search result message may be composed based on the search result and the user characteristics associated with the user device . A factual portion of the search result message may be produced from a personalization processor. A personality snippet may be selected based on a profile of the user. The search result message includes the factual portion The Boilermakers won a tight game over the Wolverines and the personality snippet ChaCha sez Boiler UP .

Similarly if the user device which is associated with the Michigan fan submits a request message an advertising message is selected based on keywords of a query and a profile associated with the user device . As before the search result is obtained and personalized. The search result is personalized by reversing the order of the participants and selecting a sentence pattern which indicates a close loss rather than a close victory. A customized factual result sentence is then combined with a personality snippet i.e. Get Mean Wolverines ChaCha and a result message is provided to the user device

If the user device which is associated with an undifferentiated user submits a request message an advertisement message may be selected based on a keyword and or a profile which may affect an advertisement provided. For example the advertisement message is not associated with a particular team but is associated with sports. A search result for the request message is obtained and a search result message is created. The search result message includes a neutral tone statement of a result and a personality snippet which may be based on other preferences expressed by a user.

A system is provided for personalizing responses from a search system. Personalization processing may be applied to any type of response. As a response is based on a known defined format sentence synthesis is facilitated. An element of a response which is intended for personalization or personality snippet is defined which may be added to any search result to simulate a comment made by a guide. If a search result is obtained from an automated resource which responds according to a predefined format a search result obtained from the automated resource may be personalized according to a predefined set of conditions associated with a resource. An output from an API or other formatted information may be processed based on inputs to a personalization processor. A personalization processor may be used to apply a style a pattern sentence a vocabulary a grammar etc. to a result provided by a search resource. A personalization processor may be implemented by fixed logic and or may be implemented using a learning system such as a neural net. A training set may be defined which is used to determine an input output map for a personalization processor.

A personalization processor is created which may receive inputs of characteristics of a user a guide and or group of guides a result to be provided to a user and a type of information to be provided to the user. As the result space may be large and the types of users and guides may be large a neural net may be used to map input parameters to selected patterns which may be processed in order to provide a personalized response to a user based on a search result. A personalization processor e.g. a neural net may be trained using training sets provided by interactions between users and guides. A training set may be selected by system administrators and or may be determined based on characteristics of guides and or users associated with queries.

Inputs to a personalization processor may be determined based on characteristics of a user characteristics of a guide random selections time result content etc. A personalization processor may reduce guide time spent in responding to a request as a guide is not required to spend time and effort formulating a response which is customer friendly while meeting constraints. A personalization processor may allow an advertisement to be modified based on characteristics of a user receiving the advertisement. A personalization processor may allow a more uniform response to a user which may improve a user experience. A personalization processor may allow a user to select a preferred type of guide response which may allow for a better user experience and may improve targeting of information to the user.

A personalization processor may enhance a user experience in various types of systems other than human assisted search systems. A system which produces automated search results may be enhanced using a personalization processor as described herein. A training set provided may be produced from activities of users and agents who may later be replaced by an automated or partially automated process. Any type of agent based customer service system might benefit from a personalization processor for various forms of communication such as voice SMS MMS EMS email IM etc.

The method and system described herein enable a more rapid and effective processing of a generalized request for information. If an automated processing of a request determines that the request is to be directed to a human searcher the request is directed to a searcher who is provided with a toolset appropriate to the task which is determined to be associated with the request. A searcher who is trained in the query processing role or expediter is provided with resources and interfaces which speed the process of providing a result responsive to a request.

An expediter toolset may include an interface which allows the expediter to provide information required to obtain a search result using an automated and or human assisted resource. An expediter is provided with access to resources which may be inaccessible to the public which may provide a response to a query based on a formatted query. A toolset is provided which allows an expediter to transfer information associated with a request to a format associated with an appropriate resource or finder . Expediter judgment may be applied to determine intent of a query which may otherwise be ambiguous.

An expediter toolset may include an interface which may be used to rapidly respond to various ambiguous queries. For example rhetorical humorous conversational or curious questions may be presented in a Quick Answer interface. A generalized processing interface is provided which may allow an expediter to rapidly select and provide a response to common queries and or types of queries without the need to perform a search or to send a request to a searcher.

An expediter toolset may include an interface for reviewing and locating queries and or results which may be an approximate match to a request. An expediter may select a query and or group of queries using any or all of a request. A modified query may be compared to previous queries to determine if a matching query exists which may cause information of the previous queries and answers associated with the queries to be provided to the expediter. Answers associated with similar queries may be selected by an expediter which may avoid the need for a search. Providing information of search results associated with approximate matches to a request may allow an expediter to locate an existing search result which is a suitable response to a request.

Using the methods and systems described herein efficiency of a human assisted search system is increased which may also lower the cost to respond to a query. An expediter capability is enhanced by providing tools which are specialized to the task of finding an answer to a generalized query without the use of a generalized search engine such as Ask Bing or Google . Rather than following the previous methods of automated comparison and use of generalized tools a classification of a type of query is performed prior to providing the query to a searcher. Before a query is presented to specialist searcher the query is provided to a guide who can rapidly respond to a high percentage of queries. The system and methods described enhance the ability of the first responder to respond to a request. A higher percentage of queries may be handled by an expediter and a user may receive a response more rapidly.

While the method and system are described in the context of a search system they might also be applied to any type of customer service activity. In lieu of providing every representative with the same training and the same tools tools which are suitable to the particular task assigned to the worker are provided. Although more effort may be expended on complex queries as a high percentage of queries are not complex. As a consequence the time and effort to respond are greatly reduced.

Query processing may be enhanced and may include a personalization feature to enhance user experience. An interactive activity may be determined by an expediter selection which may be personalized by a personalization processor associated with a profile of an expediter and or a user associated with a request. Enhanced targeting of interactive activities and responses may be integrated with query processing to provide a more valuable offering to advertisers supporting an information delivery system.
