No. 61 106 689 

This invention relates in general to wireless communications systems and more specifically to enhanced group calling features for connected portfolio services in a wireless communications network.

Advanced Voice Services AVS also known as Advanced Group Services AGS can include a number of different functions such as Push to Conference P2C or Instant Conferencing etc. as described in the co pending and commonly assigned patent applications cross referenced above and incorporated by reference herein. These AVS functions have enormous revenue earnings potential for wireless communications systems such as mobile phone networks.

Currently there are three major approaches employed in providing AVS and AGS in wireless communications systems. One approach requires the installation of a dedicated private network parallel to the wireless communications system to support the group based voice services. However a dedicated private network is costly to install and maintain.

Another approach is based on Voice over IP VoIP technologies. While this approach promises compliance with newer and emerging standards such as GPRS General Packet Radio Service UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System etc. it does not provide a solution for carriers employing wireless communications systems based on existing standards such as GSM CDMA etc. However even for the newer standards solutions based on VoIP have serious drawbacks including slower call setup significant overhead increased susceptibility to packet losses low bit rate voice coders and significant modifications to the mobile handset.

Still another approach is the innovative approach described in the co pending and commonly assigned patent applications cross referenced above and incorporated by reference herein. In this approach advanced voice services are provided by a real time exchange RTX also known as a dispatch gateway DG that interfaces to the wireless communications system to provide the advanced voice services therein wherein both the real time exchange and mobiles that use the advanced voice services communicate with each other using call setup and in band signaling within the wireless communications system.

However notwithstanding the innovations described in the co pending and commonly assigned patent applications cross referenced above there is a need in the art for improvements to the AVS as well as additional AVS that comply with existing and emerging wireless standards and provide superior user experiences. The present invention aims to satisfy this need by providing additional services also known as Connected Portfolio Services and improvements to those additional services also known as Enhanced Group Calling Features for Connected Portfolio Services in wireless communications systems.

To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification the present invention discloses Enhanced Group Calling Features for Connected Portfolio Services in wireless communications networks such as a mobile or cellular phone communications networks. The Connected Portfolio Services include Mobile Conferencing Scheduled Instant Reservationless Conference Family Connect Buddy Connect and Quick Reach while the Enhanced Group Calling Features include Voicemail Diversion Reverse Quick Reach and Single Number Group Calling. These and other aspects of the present invention are described in more detail below.

In the following description of the preferred embodiment reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration the specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized as structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

1.1 Enhanced Group Calling Features for Connected Portfolio Services in a Wireless Communications Network

The present invention discloses Connected Portfolio Services which are also described in co pending and commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 12 259 102 filed Oct. 27 2008 by Krishnakant M. Patel Bruce Lawler Gorachand Kundu Ravi Ayyasamy Ravi Shankar Kumar Harisha Mahabaleshwara Negalaguli Basem Ahmad Ardah Prathap Chandana Shan Jen Chiou Arun Velayudhan and Ramu Kandula entitled CONNECTED PORTFOLIO SERVICES FOR A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK which application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. Section 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 982 650 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 023 042 which applications are incorporated by reference herein. The present invention also discloses improvement to the Connected Portfolio Services known as Enhanced Group Calling Features for Connected Portfolio Services in wireless communications systems which are described in more detail herein.

More specifically the Connected Portfolio Services include Mobile Conferencing Scheduled Instant Reservationless Conference Family Connect Buddy Connect and Quick Reach 

1. Scheduled Conference This service allows a mobile handset user to schedule a conference with a group of other users at a predetermined date and time. There are two modes of operation Dial Out and Dial In 

a Dial Out In this option a Real Time Exchange RTX will dial out the call to participants in a scheduled conference and then bridge the conference call between the participants.

b Dial In In this option participants in a scheduled conference dial in to a conference bridge number.

A number of unique technologies are provided to facilitate the Scheduled Conference service with many user friendly features such as conference call notification one touch dial to join a conference call etc.

2. Reservationless Conference This service allows a user to set up a conference bridge and communicate the conference bridge access number and password to participants of a conference call. This solution is clientless in that the originator does not need a handset client application to invoke this service.

3. Instant Conferencing This service allows users to create and manage groups using multiple different means such as via the Web via Short Message Service SMS via Wireless Access Protocol WAP via an operator etc. Once a group is created the originator receives a single dial out number upon dialing this number the originator is connected to the group.

4. Family Connect The Family Connect service allows user to make an instant conference call to all the family members. It can utilize the operator s existing family plan database instead of creating its own database.

5. Buddy Connect The Buddy Connect service allows a user to create a buddy group and make an instant conference by any buddy member in the buddy group.

6. Quick Reach The Quick Reach service is a call originating service that allows a user to create a list of phone numbers in order to reach a particular person. When the user originates this type of call all the phones for that particular person are called and rang until one of the phones answers the call and then the rest of call attempts are dropped.

The Enhanced Group Calling Features include Voicemail Diversion Reverse Quick Reach and Single Number Group Calling 

B. Reverse Quick Reach The terminating subscriber defines how a call dialed to his her mobile number should be handled and directed. In addition the RTX is removed from the media path following a Quick Reach termination.

C. Single Number Group Calling An optimal design implementation of single number based group calling in a cellular network including a geo redundant RTX deployment.

The following illustration explains the network reference architecture used to provide the Enhanced Group Calling Features for the Connected Portfolio Services described herein. These Enhanced Group Calling Features for the Connected Portfolio Services are provided without any changes to the existing network infrastructure but merely the addition of a service control point known as a Real Time Exchange RTX connected to the network and a client application embedded in the handset although a clientless version of the handset may be provided as well .

Within the network an RTX also known as a Dispatch Gateway DG communicates with a MSC Mobile Switching Center and PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network using SS7 ISUP WIN CAMEL Signaling System 7 Integrated Services Digital Network User Part Wireless Intelligent Network Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic messages at a signaling plane . A bearer path implements a TDM Time Division Multiplexing interface carrying PCM Pulse Code Modulation or TFO Tandem Free Operation voice frames. Support for TFO in this path is negotiated between a BSC Base Station Controller and the RTX for each originating and terminating leg of an AVS call. The use of TFO ensures high voice quality as voice vocoder conversion is avoided between mobile to mobile calls.

When a subscriber originates an AVS call the MSC routes the call to the RTX . The MSC also requests the BSC via to establish a radio traffic path with a mobile station MS also known as a handset or mobile unit via the BTS Base Transceiver Station as it does for a normal cellular call . At this time the BSC tries to negotiate TFO if it is supported on a TDM link with the far end in this case the RTX .

At the same time after the MSC terminates the group call request to the RTX the RTX identifies the terminating group users and their numbers which may comprise an MS ISDN Mobile Station Integrated Services Digital Network number an IMSI International Mobile Subscriber Identity number or an MDN Mobile Directory Number .

The RTX sends an ISUP call origination request for each terminating handset . It may send requests directly to the MSC PSTN or IP network via a PDSN Public Data Switched Network Router and or Internet Intranet depending on the routing table configuration for terminating numbers. Once the bearer path is established the RTX begins a negotiation with the far end in this case the terminating BSC for each terminating leg to a handset .

Once bearer paths are established for originating and terminating legs for an AVS call the RTX switches or duplicates voice or data from the originating handset to all terminating handsets .

The RTX may also use an IP network or the Internet Intranet . The IP network or the Internet Intranet can be used in a toll bypass mode where two RTXs can exchange voice traffic bypassing the PSTN . However each RTX is responsible for terminating traffic to its closest MSC . In this case the IP network or the Internet Intranet is used as a backbone transport of voice traffic between two RTXs .

The IP network or the Internet Intranet can also be used for a registration and presence application. Since the MSC will not direct a registration request from a handset to the RTX because it would require changes in the MSC the latter does not have any information of the registered handset . To circumvent this issue a registration and presence application runs over an IP stack in the handset . After the handset registers for a data interface i.e. obtaining an IP address with the PDSN or Serving GSM Service Nodes SGSN in the case of GSM networks the registration and presence application in the handset registers with the RTX using its IP address. The RTX also uses this IP interface to update the presence information of other group members to a handset .

An alternative embodiment may use the SMS Short Message Service transport to carry presence messages over a data channel. The RTX interacts with the handset using predefined presence application related messages that are transported as SMS messages. The same messages can be transported via the PDSN interface if group users have data service.

During roaming a Home Location Register HLR and Visitor Location Register VLR can be accessed via the MSC and a MAP link . The HLR and VLR are used to track the mobile handsets within home or foreign networks while the RTX is used to track the presence of members of a group within the home or foreign networks and updates the mobile handsets for those members with the network availability of other members of the group.

A Short Message Service Center SMSC is accessible via the IP network or other element for the storage of text messages SMS messages . When an SMS message is sent to a handset the message is first stored in the SMSC until the recipient handset is available e.g. a store and forward option .

The architecture includes a Call Processing system Presence Server Real Time Event Processing system one or more Media Managers and an SMPP Short Message Peer to Peer Transport as well as modules for various SS7 protocols such as MTP Message Transfer Part Level MTP Message Transfer Part Level MTP Message Transfer Part Level ISUP Integrated Services Digital Network User Part SCCP Signaling Connection Control Part and TCAP Transactions Capabilities Application Part protocols.

The Call Processing system Presence Server Media Managers SMPP Transport and other modules communicate across an IP network . The Real Time Event Processing system communicates directly with the Call Processing system Presence Server and the modules for various SS7 protocols. The modules for various SS7 protocols communicate with other entities via a SS7 Signaling Link . The SMPP Transport communicates with a SMSC Short Message Service Center gateway using the SMPP protocol . The Media Managers communicate among themselves using the H.110 protocol or some other protocol such TCP IP .

The operation of these various components are described in more detail below as well as in the co pending and commonly assigned patent applications cross referenced above and incorporated by reference herein.

The originating handset signals the RTX via the wireless network e.g. by transmitting one or more messages to the RTX . The Media Manager systems receive the messages and pass the messages to the Call Processing system . The Call Processing CP system determines whether the originating handset has subscribed to the AVS before originating the AVS call. Upon confirmation the Call Processing system initiates a new AVS call. The Call Processing system interacts with the Presence Server and Real Time Event Processing system to cause the wireless network to perform call setup with the terminating handsets for the AVS call and thereafter to manage the AVS call.

During the AVS call the Call Processing system interacts with the Media Manager systems to maintain the H.110 channels and assign any additional H.110 channels required for the AVS call which may span across multiple Media Manager systems . During the AVS call the Media Manager systems of the RTX are used to mix audio streams between the originating handset and the terminating handset and then deliver these mixed audio streams to the originating handset and the terminating handset . The H.110 channels are used for passing mixed and unmixed audio streams voice between the Media Manager systems as required.

Preferably the software architecture used in the handset provides an application programming interface API that supports the logic and data required within the handset for providing cellular service including the functions necessary for the making an AVS call generally for providing the Connected Portfolio Services generally and for providing the Enhanced Group Calling Features for the Connected Portfolio Services specifically.

The high level functional components of the handset include a subscriber identity module SIM encoder decoder processing logic and user interface . A client application is provided on the SIM that supports AVS functionality for the handset . In addition the SIM stores a database which includes an address book AVS contacts and or group information.

At power on the handset loads the client application necessary to support the AVS. This functionality provided includes the look and feel of the menu displays on the handset as well as user interaction with the menu displays.

During operation the encoder decoder decodes and encodes messages and populates specific data structures in the handset . The encoder decoder checks the validity of the incoming messages by verifying mandatory parameters for each of the incoming messages. A message will not be processed further if the encoder decoder fails to decode the message.

The processing logic handles all the AVS related functionalities. The processing logic implementation is device specific and vendor specific and it interacts with the other components including the encoder decoder user interface client application and database .

The processing logic provides an auto answer mechanism for AVS calls. Specifically when a call is received the processing logic automatically answers the call. The processing logic makes use of call notification for incoming call detection and based on various parameters received within the call notification determines whether the call is an AVS call. If the call is an AVS call then the processing logic uses AT commands to answer the AVS call and turn on the speaker of the handset . All of this takes place within a certain time period. On the other hand if the call is not an AVS call then normal call processing is performed by the handset .

The processing logic also provides floor control using DTMF tone control. For example in push to talk P2T calls which are half duplex a determination of who may talk is based on who has the floor. Using the processing logic provided in the handset appropriate DTMF tones are sent to the RTX in accordance with specific key sequences i.e. pressing and or releasing a P2T key that indicate whether the floor has been requested and or released by the user.

In addition the processing logic provides SMS destination control based on the type of subscriber. At the time of subscriber data provisioning if it is determined that the handset will use AVS based logic then appropriate logic is invoked in the RTX to send presence messages over SMS to the handset . Similarly the handset is configured at the time of provisioning to receive accept such SMS and respond to the RTX appropriately.

Finally the processing logic also enables subscribers to track the presence of fellow members of the group in the network on their handset and provides a mechanism and API to carry out contacts and group management operations on the handset such as add member delete member etc.

Since most of the presence information is stored in the database the database is tightly integrated with the processing logic . The database stores groups contacts presence and availability related information. The database information essentially contains group and member information along with presence information associated with each group and member. Apart from group and member information the database also stores subscriber information such as privileges presence information etc. The other components of the handset may interact with the database to retrieve update the group members and presence information for various operations. The database also has pointers to the native address book on the handset to provide seamless alias naming for contacts used with cellular calls as well as AVS.

The user interface provides a mechanism for the user to view and manage groups group members contacts presence and availability. The user interface also makes it possible to invoke the AVS from the group contact list screens as described in more detail below.

The RTX and handset work together to provide the functionality of the Connected Portfolio Services for the wireless communications network . The specifics of this functionality are described in more detail in the following sections.

The Scheduled Conference service allows a moderator to schedule a conference in advance. Establishing a scheduled conference can be done by connecting to the RTX through the handset or via Internet access. The originator can specify how to set up the type of participant connection Dial In or Dial Out and whether a moderator e.g. the originator is required on the call or not.

The RTX notifies each participant and originator with the conference details using SMS. For Dial Out conferences also known as an Instant Conference IC the RTX dials each participant at the scheduled time. For Dial In conferences also known as a Reservationless Conference RC each participant simply presses the Send key on their handset after high lighting the bridge number within the conference details SMS.

Block represents the originator selecting a New Conference option on the handset and providing the conference details via the user interface shown in . The originator then selects the conference participants from the address book and presses the Send key on the handset to complete the scheduling of the conference which sends an SMS to the RTX.

In Dial In mode the participant selects the conference details SMS on the handset and then selects the Send key on the handset to dial into the conference. The conference participants may also dial in from a landline using a global number and access code.

This feature provides the user with the ability to add or drop participants to an active conference call. The user can select some specified number of participants to add to or drop from a conference call. The Mid Call Add Drop feature can be accessed by the user under an Options menu on the handset.

This feature allows for the originator or any participants of a conference call to rejoin an active conference call if they have dropped at any time. The RTX sends an SMS to the originator and all participants of the conference call with the bridge information. The end user can simply press the Send key on the handset while displaying the SMS to rejoin the conference call. To rejoin a clientless conference the participants can dial a global conference number and enter an access code at any time. An SMS is not sent to clientless conference participants.

The Family Connect service is an Instant Conference service that utilizes the existing operator s existing family plan database and terminates calls to all the family members when a nation wide number is dialed by the user.

Alternatively when an operator s network does not provide a family plan database this service provides a Web interface for the user to create update view her his own family members.

The Buddy Connect service is Instant Conference service wherein the user creates buddy connect groups via the Internet.

The Quick Reach service allows a user to reach a called party by making call attempts to all possible phone numbers i.e. Customer Premise Equipment CPE used or owned by the called party. The user creates Quick Reach groups via the Internet.

A Reservationless Conference also known as Clientless Conference provides a Meet me on my bridge capability without a client on the handset. Each clientless conference subscriber will have a standing bridge that can be accessed at anytime. The conference owner will create an access code for each conference and provide the access code to the participants. Participants will enter the access code that was created by the conference owner and join the conference once the owner has joined the call.

Block represents the initiation of the conference at the conference start time. The originator and the participants dial the call in number and are prompted by the RTX to enter the conference ID and the access code. The conference participants may dial in from a landline as well as a handset. All of the participants can rejoin the conference call at any time using the same steps.

This feature provides the user with the ability to add or drop participants to from an active Clientless Conference. The originator can enter the full MDN of the participant to add or drop from the keypad of the handset during an active Clientless Conference

As noted above the Connected Portfolio Services include such services as Mobile Conferencing i.e. Scheduled Instant Reservationless Conferencing Family Connect Group Connect and Quick Reach all of which use a single number to designate a logical group of numbers.

In the case of Mobile Conferencing Family Connect and Group Connect the numbers represented are the conference participant numbers family or group members numbers respectively. In the case of Quick Reach the numbers represent one particular subscriber s numbers such as home office mobile etc. 

In all variants of the Connected Portfolio Services it is imperative that the RTX initiating the terminating legs of the Connected Portfolio Services recognizes that one or more of the terminating legs of the Connected Portfolio Services has been diverted to voicemail and drops the terminating legs that have been diverted to voicemail from the Connected Portfolio Services. The diversion of call legs to voicemail and the dropping those call legs from inclusion in a conference bridge prevents the group communications from being recorded on a voicemail which entails privacy issues and also prevents the awkward interjection of voicemail greetings and announcements into the group communications.

In Step 2 the RTX translates the dialed number to several termination numbers to whom the call should be terminated B C and D .

In Step 3 the termination device C is unreachable so the MSC diverts the call to voicemail and indicates the diversion to the RTX in an ISUP CPG message containing a diversion or forwarded to number.

In Step 4 the RTX receives the forwarded to number in the ISUP CPG message and checks the number against a database of voicemail destination numbers. If the diversion number is configured in the voicemail destination number database then this leg of the call is dropped from inclusion in the service.

Note that if the diversion number does not match a voicemail destination number in the database then the next check performed by the RTX is the input from user that applies as described in the next figure.

In Step 2 the RTX translates the dialed number to several termination numbers to whom the call should be terminated B C and D .

In Step 3 the termination device D is unreachable and a landline switch diverts the call to voicemail but no indication is sent to the RTX indicate the call diversion.

In Step 4 the RTX waits for the user to press to join the call. Since this leg is connected to a voicemail no such input will be forthcoming. The RTX will timeout waiting for this input and drops this leg of the call from inclusion in the service.

As noted above Quick Reach is a service that allows the originator to ring multiple phone numbers of the same person simultaneously sequentially or selectively i.e. an originating user service . Reverse Quick Reach is variation of the above service albeit a terminating user service that applies termination call handling to the terminator s published mobile number during termination and allows simultaneous sequential or selective ringing of multiple phone numbers. Specifically when the terminating user answers one of the phone numbers the remaining legs of the call are dropped.

The service is accomplished by arming the mobile number for terminating triggers. A Gateway MSC GMSC terminating the call which is an MSC directly connected to the RTX is instructed to connect to the RTX for subscribers that are configured for this service. The RTX then terminates the calls to all the numbers configured for this user. When the user answers at one of the numbers and presses the key to confirm joining the group call the RTX drops the remaining unanswered legs and connects the user to the originator.

In Step 2 the GMSC queries the HLR for the terminating subscriber B and receives the trigger information which instructs the GMSC to contact the RTX.

In Step 3 the GMSC contacts the RTX which checks B s subscription to this service and instructs the GMSC to connect the call to the RTX.

In Step 4 the RTX terminates the call to all of the destination numbers configured for B B C and D . The answered leg is preserved and the remaining unanswered legs are dropped from the call.

Note that if B is not configured on the RTX for any other destination numbers the RTX will leave itself out of the media path by instructing the GMSC to Continue in its processing of the call toward B i.e. Step 3 .

Note also that termination to B from the RTX may trigger another query to the RTX just as in Step 3. For the second query the RTX instructs the GMSC to Continue processing the call toward B.

Both Quick Reach and Reverse Quick Reach are services that ultimately connect an originator to one and only one terminator. This presents an opportunity for bearer path optimization where the RTX can exclude itself from the bearer path after the call has been answered i.e. normal call processing in the network can be used .

To take advantage of this optimization the terminating call must traverse the MSC that originated the call which typically is the GMSC through which the RTX is connected. The RTX would instruct the GMSC to initiate a connection cut through very similar to the cut through that occurs during subsequent handoff scenarios where IS 41 message directives indicate to an anchor MSC to connect to a serving MSC by dropping an intervening MSC from the connection however in this scenario it is the intervening RTX that is dropped from the connection.

In Step 3 the RTX terminates the call to all of the destination numbers configured for B B and C . The answered leg B is preserved and the remaining leg C is dropped from the call.

In Step 4 knowing that B has answered the call the RTX can then issue a facility directive to the GMSC that the circuits that need to be connected internally within the GMSC.

In Step 5 the GMSC reconfigures the connections to leave the RTX out of the media path by connecting the incoming bearer path or leg from A represented by an associated incoming CIC Circuit Identification Code to the outgoing bearer path or leg to B represented by an associated outgoing CIC.

Note that if B is not configured on the RTX for more than one destination numbers the RTX will leave itself out of the media path by instructing the GMSC to Continue in its processing of the call toward B Step 3 .

Note also that termination to B from the RTX may trigger another query to RTX just as in Step 3. For the second query the RTX instructs the GMSC to Continue processing call toward B.

Each of the Enhanced Group Calling features including Mobile Conferencing Family Connect Group Connect and Quick Reach that employ a single number to represent a logical group of numbers can be realized in an network using one of the following approaches described herein.

These approaches include the deployment of a geo redundant RTX i.e. a Geo RTX which is a redundant RTX located at a geographically different location. Moreover these approaches revolve around an optimal use of a block of numbers and simplifying Translation Table entries within the network through a creative use of a temporary routing number.

These approaches collectively apply to a family of features known as Connected Applications and are defined by Connected Applications Routing.

In Step 2 this dialing string is analyzed by the MSC Originator A Dialed 111 222 3001 and routed to RTX.

In Step 3 RTX determines from an EMS Element Management System Table that 111 222 3001 is assigned to RTX. RTX queries RTX to retrieve a temporary routing number.
