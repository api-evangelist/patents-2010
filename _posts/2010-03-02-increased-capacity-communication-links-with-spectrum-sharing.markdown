This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802 09 C 0001 awarded by the Department of the United States Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

There is great demand for high capacity communication links in a variety of industrial and government settings including for example in mobile telephony satellite communications broadband data communications etc. Existing methods for increasing the capacity e.g. the data rate of a communications link suffer from high costs high power requirements and the limited availability of bandwidth. For example it is known to increase communications link capacity using higher order modulation techniques such as for example 16 QAM. Successfully implementing higher order modulation techniques however requires a relatively high bit energy to noise spectral density ratio E N and linear power amplifiers. High values for E Nrequire increased transmission power. Operating a power amplifier in a linear manner however often requires an increased power back off. Accordingly the use of higher order modulation techniques is often unsatisfactory. This is especially the case in communications links with severe power constraints such as for example high capacity satellite links. It is also known for example in the commercial television industry that increased communications link capacity can be obtained using power division multiple accessing PDMA . According to PDMA two or more signals may occupy the same spectrum bandwidth. At least one of the signals however must have a relatively higher power level typically 10 dB or more depending on the number of signals. Again power constraints often render these methods undesirable.

Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for increasing the capacity of a communications link by intentionally overlapping the spectrums of a main wideband signal and one or more narrowband signals. The narrowband signal or signals may have center frequencies offset from the center frequency of the wideband signal such that the signal spectrums overlap. According to various embodiments the narrowband signal or signals may be spectrally positioned completely or partially within a skirt region of the wideband signal s spectrum. Accordingly significant portions of the resulting interference effects between the signals may be removed by filtering. Additional interference may be removed from the wideband signal by detecting the narrowband signal or signals estimating the interference caused to the wideband signal from the narrowband signal or signals and compensating for the narrowband signal interference. In various embodiments a similar process may be implemented to remove additional interference from the narrowband signals due to the wideband signal. According to various embodiments the wideband signal and the narrowband signal or signals may be transmitted from the same transmitter location or from different transmitters locations.

Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for increasing the capacity of a communications link by intentionally overlapping the spectrums of a main wideband signal and one or more narrowband signals. illustrates one embodiment of a chart showing frequency domain representations e.g. spectrums or spectrum distributions of a wideband signal WB and two narrowband signals NB and NB having overlapping frequency spectrums. The frequency domain representations of the WB NB and NB signals are indicated as Gs Gs f and Gs f respectively.

Prior to transmission each of the signals WB NB NB may be filtered with band limiting square root raised cosine SRC filters thus causing the signals WB NB NB to have skirts as shown. A skirt may be defined as a frequency band where a signal s power spectral density drops off from a predetermined portion of the peak power spectral density to zero e.g. dB . For example where the signal skirt begins at 6 dB from peak spectral power density it may take up of the 6 dB bandwidth of the signal where is the roll off factor of the SRC filter.

As illustrated in the spectrums of the narrowband signals NB NB are frequency shifted by fand f respectively from the center frequency f of the wideband signal. The frequency offsets fand fmay be selected such that the spectrums of the narrowband signals NB NB overlap the spectrum of the wideband signal as shown. According to various embodiments and sometimes depending on the data rate of the signals NB NB the spectrums of the signals NB NB may be limited to within the skirt of the wideband signal WB or may extend beyond the skirt of the wideband signal WB as shown in .

According to various embodiments the signals WB NB NB may originate from separate transmitters that may be at separate physical locations. The transmitters may generate the signal spread shown in by utilizing different carrier frequencies. For example a transmitter for the narrowband signal NB may utilize a carrier frequency that is offset from the carrier frequency of the wideband signal transmitter by f. A transmitter for the narrowband signal NB may utilize a carrier frequency that is offset from the carrier frequency of the wideband signal transmitter by f.

In various embodiments the signals WB NB and NB may originate from a single source. illustrates one embodiment of a block diagram showing a transmitter for deriving and transmitting the signals WB NB NB. An input binary data stream may be provided to a data splitter . The data splitter may split the input stream into the signals WB NB and NB as shown. The wideband signal WB may be modulated by a complex baseband modulator resulting in a filtered complex signal 1 In 1 and in the other equations herein the letter j may represent square root over 1 unless otherwise noted. The narrowband signals NB NB may likewise be modulated by complex baseband modulators and respectively generating additional filtered complex signals given by 2 and 3 below 2 3 The modulators as well as other modulators and demodulators herein are described in terms of Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying OQPSK . It will be appreciated that any suitable modulators or modulation methods may be used including for example other types of phase shift keying amplitude shift keying methods frequency shift keying methods etc.

The filtered complex signals given by 1 2 and 3 above may be scaled at nodes and by scaling factors A Aand A respectively. The scaling factors A Aand Amay be selected to appropriately apportion the amplifier power among the three signals WB NB NB. The output of the scaling nodes may be a set of complex baseband signals g t g t and g t corresponding to the wideband signal WB and the narrowband signals NB NB respectively. The complex baseband signals g t and g t corresponding to the narrowband signals NB NB may be input to subcarrier modulators respectively. Subcarrier modulator may translate the frequency spectrum of the complex baseband signal g t by f resulting in exp 2 4 Likewise subcarrier modulator may translate the frequency spectrum of the complex baseband signal g t by f resulting in exp 2 5 The complex baseband signal g t as well as those given by 4 and 5 above may be combined at signal combiner to generate a composite complex baseband signal g t .

The composite baseband signal g t may be input to a complex baseband to intermediate frequency IF converter which may up convert signal g t to the intermediate frequency. For example a complex to real converter may separate the composite baseband signal g t into real and imaginary components. The real component may be modulated at node by the intermediate frequency signal generated by an intermediate frequency oscillator . The imaginary component may be modulated by the intermediate frequency shifted by 2. The real and imaginary signals may be summed at summing junction . The resulting intermediate frequency IF signal may be filtered at intermediate frequency bandpass filter and multiplied by a signal fat node . The signal fmay be selected according to Equation 6 such that the node up coverts the intermediate frequency signal to radio frequency RF . 6 After RF bandpass filtering at the resulting signal may be amplified at and transmitted by antenna . Although shows an OQPSK upconverter it will be appreciated that an upconverter according to any suitable modulation technique may be used.

A second output may be delayed by a delay equal to T 2 wherein Tis the symbol time for the WB signal. Accordingly the second signal is offset by T 2 in time with respect to the in phase signal making the second signal an offset quadature signal. The quadrature signal is then input to the square root raised cosine filter which may also have a roll off factor of . The result may be a filtered quadrature signal denoted by Q t . The in phase and quadrature signals may be input to a real to complex converter which may output the filtered complex signal given by 1 above and described in .

Referring back to the received RF signal r t may be down converted to an intermediate frequency fby a mixer connected to an RF local oscillator with a frequency fdefined according to Equation 12 below 12 The output of the mixer may be filtered by intermediate frequency baseband filter . The filter may be a band pass filter with a center frequency of fand a bandwidth equal to the bandwidth of the composite signal v t . The output of the filter may be an intermediate frequency signal which may be converted to real and imaginary parts of the complex baseband equivalent by the complex mixer . The mixer may split the complex baseband signal down convert a first portion to baseband at mixer and down convert the section portion to baseband at mixer . A local oscillator may provide the baseband demodulating reference signal to mixer . The reference signal offset by 2 radians by the 2 phase shift block may be applied to mixer . The resulting baseband signals a t and b t may be low pass filtered at filters . It will be appreciated that the complex mixer output may also have a noise component. This component however is not shown in for purposes of clarity. The baseband signal outputs of the complex mixer may be converted from analog to digital at analog to digital converters ADC s . The sampling rate Ffor the ADC s may be selected to be greater than or equal to the bandwidth of Bof the band pass signal v t . Tmay denote the sampling interval which is equal to 1 F. After being converted to digital the baseband signals a k and b k may be combined by the real to complex converter to form the complex baseband signal given by 13 below 13 

Next the complex baseband signal is filtered to isolate the components due to the NB and NB signals. Before showing the specific implementation shown in a general discussion is provided. To isolate the component of the complex baseband signal NB for example a complex bandpass filter having a frequency response H f given by 14 may be applied to the complex baseband signal.

The Fourier transform of the real band pass signal v k obtained by shifting the real RF signal v t along with its in band interference introduced by the WB signal to a center frequency fand converting the resulting signal in to digital form may be expressed in terms of the filter transfer function H f and its Hilbert transform by 19 0.5 0.5 19 In 19 A f and B f denote the Fourier transform of a k and b k respectively.

Similarly the Fourier transform of the real band pass signal v k obtained by shifting the RF signal v t to a center frequency fand converting the resulting signal in to digital form is obtained as shown by 20 0.5 0.5 20 In 20 the real band pass filter frequency response H f of bandwidth equal to the bandwidth of the second NB signal v t is given by 21 

The configuration of illustrates a specific case where f fand B B. In this case the two filters HBP and HBP a identical and in view of Equations 20 and 21 may be recovered by a single pair of filters H f and f as shown in . The frequency response of H f may be given by Equation 22 below 0.5 22 f may be the corresponding Hilbert transform filter of H f . The filters may take as input the baseband signals a k b k as shown. The outputs of the respective filters may be combined as illustrated at summing junctions and to generate a pair of digital signals v k and v k . Both signals v k and v k may be input to respective carrier phase tracking loops to provide the complex valued carrier reference signals exp j T k k and exp j T k k where the phase at the input to the pair of bandpass filters H f and f is the reference phase and Tk and Tk are the respective phase delays from the reference point to the carrier phase tracking loop outputs corresponding to a processing delay of kT. The complex valued carrier reference signal exp j T k k may be input to a complex conjugate operator block . The output of the block may be multiplied by the complex constant exp Tk at multiplier to remove the impact of the processing delay kTfrom the reference signal exp j T k k and generate the reference local oscillator signal v k exp j Tk . Similarly the signal exp j T k k may be multiplied by the complex constant exp Tk at multiplier to generate the reference local oscillator signal v k exp j Tk .

Both of the signals k and circumflex over Q k may be input to a real to complex converter to generate the complex valued signal k jcircumflex over Q k . This signal may be multiplied by the complex constant exp Tk at phase adjustor to incorporate phase delay introduced by the processing delay of kTby the filter samplers detectors and the filters . The resulting signal may be modulated by the signal exp j Tk at modulator to shift the spectrum to the center frequency . Additionally the signal may be multiplied by the gain estimate at creating a delayed estimate circumflex over v k of the signal v k where the delay is equal to ksamples. The gain estimate may be derived from the outputs of the samplers 

For example denoting the outputs of the samplers as by aand brespectively the amplitude estimate is obtained by

The components of portion of the module may operate in a manner similar to that described above to generate a delayed estimate circumflex over v k of the signal v k . In the portion however the roll off factor of the various SRC filters may be equal to . Further the delay associated with the delayed estimate circumflex over v k may be ksamples. The delayed estimates circumflex over v k and circumflex over v k may be utilized to remove from the wideband signal WB the effects of interference from the narrowband signals NB NB for example as described below with respect to the module .

The interference compensated and carrier phase corrected complex baseband signal v k may be split into the real and imaginary parts by a complex to real converter . The real and imaginary parts of v k may be filtered by the respective SRC filters and sampled by samplers at the symbol rate with the sampling times provided by STR both directly for the real part and delayed by a delay equal to T 2 at for the imaginary part . The result may be an in phase sampled output v m and a quadrature sampled output v m .

The sampled output v m delayed by T 2 at and u m may be input to a parallel to serial converter for multiplexing the inphase and quadrature signals v m and v m into a single real signal v n at a rate 2R where n denotes the bit time index of the signal v. The signal v n is input to a soft limiter for the purpose of quantization wherein the number of quantization levels is dependent upon the error correction decoder block that follows the soft limiter . According to various embodiments the soft limiter may be replaced by a hard limiter. In embodiments where the wideband signal WB represents a data stream independent from the narrowband signals NB NB then the bare wideband signal WB may be input to the error detection decoder to generate the wideband source data as shown. In embodiments where the wideband signal WB is obtained by splitting an otherwise single user signal as illustrated in the wide band signal WB data at the output of the soft limiter of may be combined with the narrowband signal or signals NB and NB which may be derived for example as shown in . The result may be input to the detection decoder .

The module may also comprise a portion that utilizes the in phase sampled output v m and a quadrature sampled output v m to generate a reconstructed wideband signal k jcircumflex over b k . The reconstructed wideband signal k jcircumflex over b k may be used to mitigate interference to the narrowband signals NB NB due to the wideband signal WB. The signal v m may be processed by detector and SRC filter to provide a filtered version of the real part of the wideband data denoted by k . Similarly the signal v m may be processed by the detector and SRC filter to provide a filtered version of the imaginary component of the wideband data denoted by circumflex over Q k . The real and imaginary components k and circumflex over Q k may be combined at the real to complex converter to provide a filter version of the complex baseband wideband WB data k jcircumflex over Q k . This signal may be multiplied by an amplitude estimate at resulting in the delayed version of the wideband signal k jcircumflex over b k for eliminating the interference from the narrowband signals. The amplitude estimate may be generated by the baseband carrier tracking loop as illustrated below with reference to or may generated as described above with respect to 22a .

In embodiments where the signals are modulated according to OQPSK modulation the soft limiter output may be delayed by T 2 at . The delayed version from may be input to the parallel to serial converter . Similarly the imaginary part of the signal vmay be filtered by SRC filter with a roll off factor sampled at the rate Tby sampler . Again the resulting signal may be input to soft limiter . The output of the soft limiter may be the second input to the parallel to serial converter . The serial output of the parallel to serial converter may represent the soft limited version of the binary bit stream of the NB signal and may be input to the error correction decoder for providing the recovered NB source data. It will be appreciated that the module for recovering the narrowband signal NB may operate in a manner substantially similar to that of the module as illustrated in with suitable differences. For example the SRC filters of the module may operate with a roll off factor of .

The values u m and u m may be multiplied at multiplier to provide the second of the component signals required for generating the phase error signal. The two component signals may be multiplied at multiplier to generate the phase error signal u m . The phase error signal u m may be filtered at filter integrated at integrator and further operated on by exp block to generate the phase difference signal exp jcircumflex over m utilized by the module as described above.

The operating of the loop may be further explained mathematically as follows. Referring to the complex signal u m obtained after eliminating the interference from the narrowband signals and appearing at the output of the sampler may be given by 23 exp 23 In 23 m denotes the carrier phase at symbol time m m and m are the in phase and quadrature noise samples each with variance and I m and Q m are the in phase and quadrature binary data streams of the wideband signal WB taking values 1. Referring again to the output u m of the data phase corrector may then given by 24 exp 24 With the substitution for u m from 23 24 may be written as shown in 25 exp 25 In 25 m m circumflex over m may be the phase estimation error and n m jn m may represent the phase rotated version of the noise m m jcircumflex over n m . Thus each of n m and n m terms may also have a variance equal to . From 25 the real and imaginary parts of u m may be expressed as cos sin 26 sin cos 27 Squaring both sides of 26 and 27 and dropping the index m for convenience yields 1sin 2 28 and 1sin 2 29 

In 28 29 and are zero mean noise processes. From 28 29 0.5 0.5 0.5 30 Taking expected value on both sides of 30 yields 0.5 31 In 31 E denotes the expected value operator which in practice is estimated by a time average over a period N as is the case in the embodiment shown in and comprises one of the outputs of the baseband phase detector in . Thus the estimate of Ais given by 31 

When the wideband and narrowband data streams are obtained by splitting a single input data stream the symbol rates R Rfor the narrowband signals NB NB and the frequency offsets fand fmay be selected such that they are integrally related to the symbol rate Rof the wideband data. Accordingly the symbol timing signals for the narrowband signals and the subcarrier frequency fand fsignals may be derived from the common symbol timing signal for the wideband signal WB at the receiver and thus do not require independent tracking loops. Conversely in embodiments where the symbol rates R Rfor the narrowband signals NB NB and the frequency offsets fand fare not integrally related to the symbol rate Rof the wideband data separate independent tracking loops may be required for one or both of the narrowband signals NB NB.

According to various embodiments iterative techniques may be utilized to further increase the performance of the receiver. For example the process of removing interference from the WB signal modules and and of removing interference from the NB and NB signals modules and may be executed more than once. For example when desired the WB signal obtained by the module and or may be reprocessed a second time with the regenerated interference free NB signals obtained from modulates and .

According to other various embodiments the error correction decoder of the modules and in may be made a part of an iterative process wherein the detected data e.g. the WB source data is input to the error correction code decoder . The error corrected source data at the output of the error correction code decoder may then be encoded by an error correction encoder not shown to generate modified detected data. The modified detected data may then be used instead of the detected data before error correction code decoding to regenerate the various signals for eliminating the mutual interference among the wideband and narrowband signals while accounting for the delay introduced by the decoder and encoder pair. For example detectors may be replaced by soft limiters the outputs of which may be multiplexed by a parallel to serial converter not shown . The multiplexed output may be processed by the cascade of the error correction code decoder and encoder the output of the cascade is then input to a serial to parallel converter. The two outputs of the serial to parallel converter may be input to the src filters 

According to various embodiments the techniques described herein may be utilized to combine more than three signals further increasing capacity. For example illustrates one embodiment of a configuration comprising seven signals with spectrum overlap. In the signal spectrum V f may correspond to the bandwidth of the wideband signal WB described above while signal spectrums V f V f may correspond to the bandwidth of the narrowband signals NB and NB described above. As illustrated in however an additional signal v t is added such that the left edge of its spectrum V f coincides with the 6 dB cut off frequency of V f . A signal v t is added with its spectrum V f limited to within the 6 dB cut off frequencies of V f and V f . Two additional signals v t and v t are also shown with their spectrum lying to the left of the center frequency of V f . The signals v t v t and v t may be obtained by splitting the data stream of a single narrowband signal. These signals may be processed iteratively by a receiver. For example the receiver may first detect the signals v t and v t and then mitigate their interference from v t detect v t and finally use the reconstructed signal to mitigate the interference from signals v t and v t . Similarly the signals v t and v t v t are detected. The interference from all of the narrowband signals may then be removed from the wideband signal v t .

In the case where all of the signals are confined to the bandwidth of the wideband signal and the narrowband signals have their spectrums confined to within 6 dB cut off frequencies of the neighboring signals then the total achievable symbol rate Rmay be computed as 

Although the embodiments described herein comprise a single wideband signal and multiple narrowband signal the principles set forth may apply equally to embodiments having more than one wideband signal. For example two or more signals may be wideband having the same or nearly equal bandwidths. The wideband signals may be spectrally positioned such that there is significant overlap between their spectrums. Narrowband signals may but need not always be placed in the skirts of one or more of the wideband signals. Mutual interference among these signals may be mitigated by the recursive detection interference estimation and mitigation procedures described herein.

According to various embodiments the techniques described herein may be utilized to combine and decouple signals with modulations other than OQPSK including for example Multiple Phase Shift Keying MPSK such as Eight Phase Shift Keying 8PSK and Multiple Quadrature Amplitude Modulation MQAM with a number of symbols M in the symbol alphabet greater than four. Furthermore it may not be necessary to modulate all of the combined signals according to the same modulation. For example the wideband signal may be OQPSK modulated with the narrowband signals having 8PSK modulation.

According to various embodiments the baseband filter of the baseband signals may be different than the square root raised cosine filter and the skirt may be defined differently than with reference to the frequency at which the power spectral density is 6 dB lower than the peak power spectral density of the signal and thus the signal spectrums overlap may extend beyond the 6 dB bandwidth.

As a validation of the systems and methods described herein a simulation program was developed utilizing the MATLAB software package available from THE MATHWORKS. The results are presented for the case of a wideband signal WB and a single narrowband signal NB with spectrum overlap. To keep the focus on the interference rejection it is assumed in the simulations that the various carrier phase tracking and symbol timing recovery loops provide error free reference signals. This may be typical in simulations of traditional systems including that of the first test case described herein below. In the simulations presented herein it is assumed that the wideband and narrowband signals arise from different physical locations. Thus while the wideband signal WB receiver processes the narrowband signal NB to mitigate the interference due to the NB signal and the NB signal receiver simply ignores the presence of the WB signal.

Performance may be further improved by increasing as shown in the following. It is noted from the description above and from the simulation of the second test case that the performance difference between the wideband and narrowband signals arise as the wideband receiver demodulates the narrowband signal and uses the result for the narrowband signal to improve its own performance. In the second test case however the narrow band receiver ignored the presence of the wideband signal. This is reasonable when the two signals arise from different physical locations and are destined to different physical locations as was assumed in the second test case. When the two signals are obtained by splitting a single wideband symbol stream however the same receiver will recover both signals. This may also be the case when two or more physical locations transmit to the same receiver. As described above in this case the wideband signal detected channel symbols may be fed back to improve the narrowband signal performance. In such embodiments it is expected that the performance of the narrowband signal will be similar to that of the wideband signal e.g. there will be negligible degradation due to spectrum overlap . The relative increase in the peak PSD of the narrowband signal results in an overall increase in the transmit power or equivalently the E N requirement compared to the case of no such increase or equivalently for the case of no spectrum overlap. Denoting by E N such an increase may be given by 46 10 log 1 1 46 

For the second test case with 1 dB E N 0.18 dB which is relatively small. When the wideband and narrowband signals arise from different physical locations it is very likely that the narrowband receiver may have a relatively high receiver noise spectral density Ncompared to that of the wideband receiver and thus will inherently require a higher relative E N thus implying no increase in E N due to spectral overlap.

In order to increase the Pperformance of the narrowband signal for the case when the narrowband signal is received by an independent receiver the relative peak PSD of the narrowband signal may be increased beyond 1 dB. shows a chart of the performance results for a third test case similar to the second test case but with 2 dB. In a first curve shows the performance of the wideband signal while a second curve shows the ideal performance. shows a chart having a first curve corresponding to the actual performance of the narrowband signal and a curve corresponding to the ideal performance.

The third test case illustrated in results in a power sharing loss Pof 1.2 dB as computed from 37 . The resulting increase in the E N requirement as computed from 44 is given by E N 0.4 dB. As may be inferred from there is no penalty in terms of the required E N as expected from the third test case where 1 dB. Also the channel Pcan be satisfied for systems with most error correction coding schemes. In fact a Pof 10may be achieved even with a smaller value of than 2 dB. Thus an increase of 20 24 in symbol rate may be achieved at the cost of a relatively small increase of 0.3 dB in the E N requirement. When the two symbol streams are generated by the same terminal there is no meaningful performance degradation even with such an increase in the capacity e.g. the capacity is increased at little cost in terms of E N .

According to various embodiments the performance of the narrowband can be further increased by increasing the value of above 2 dB considered in third test case of . For example show charts of the performance results for a fourth test case where 3 dB. shows a chart comprising a first curve illustrating the probability of bit error for the wideband signal P versus the E N for the fourth test case along with a plot of the ideal case. shows a chart comprising a first curve showing the fourth test case result for the narrowband signal P as well as a curve showing the ideal narrowband case. As may be inferred from a probability of bit error Pof 10may be achieved with a E N of 2.6 dB. The corresponding Pfor a E N of 2.6 dB is equal to 0.025 from which is very close to the ideal case when only the wideband signal is present. Thus with an appropriate selection of and E N the Prequirements for both the wideband and the narrowband terminals may be satisfied. Selection of 3 dB results in an overall E N penalty of E N 0.66 dB.
