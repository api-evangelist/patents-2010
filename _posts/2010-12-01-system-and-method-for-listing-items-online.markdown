This application is a continuation of PCT Application No. PCT CA2009 000740 filed Jun. 2 2009 and claims priority from U.S. provisional application No. 61 058 475 filed Jun. 3 2008 and U.S. provisional application No. 61 101 029 filed Sep. 29 2008 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Various websites and other programs or applications allow users to post or list items. Such items may be listed or posted for sale or simply to provide information and or details of the items depending on the application or the website. Many existing tools provided by posting or listing items utilize multiple steps in multiple pages while information and data is being gathered which can be a time consuming process. Users are typically also required to categorize the items being posted based on a category that best matches what it is they are posting. This may or may not be an accurate description of the actual item. For example when selling a specific auto part such as a starter brush a suitable category may not appear. Instead a list of suggested categories may appear which requires further effort and time from the user.

Turning now to the drawings and in particular a system for posting or listing an item and for searching and viewing already posted or listed items is generally denoted by numeral and with hereinafter be referred to as the system . The system is configured to enable one or more buyers to search view and purchase listed items that have been posted or listed by one or more sellers through an intermediary . The intermediary may comprise a server machine or any other hardware or software required to host a listing service in this example a website provided through the Internet. The buyers and sellers can access the intermediary through an appropriate network which in the following examples will be the Internet. However it will be appreciated that the network may be any other suitable network such as a local network or other closed system.

The intermediary has access to or comprises a categorization database which includes data pertaining to the way in which an item is categorized classified named organized etc. as will be explained in greater detail below. The intermediary also has access to or comprises a data storage device or memory hereinafter referred to as the items database which stores the items that are listed. In this example the items database stores single items and multi items wherein multi items are items which may themselves comprise multiple parts or components that could be individually posted as single items but are more conveniently posted as a multi item . For example when selling auto parts an entire car may be posted as a multi item with all its parts so that sellers can simply browse through the parts associated with the particular vehicle and list them all at once without having to manually list them one by one. Buyers can also make requests for parts through the system using the request form shown in and the request response page shown in as later described herein. The items database shown in is for illustrative purposes only and may also store other items such as but not limited to bin and catalogue items.

Single item listings allow sellers to create both single item listings and multiple quantity listings for identical or similar items . With a single item listing when a buyer opts to buy that item they are effectively purchasing every item included in that listing. For example if selling auto parts a seller may list 4 rims with a price of 50. When the buyer opts to buy this item they are in fact buying 4 rims for 50. In contrast a multiple quantity listing described later allows the seller to list 4 rims at 50 each separately so the buyer would need to select how many of the 4 rims they are buying and if buying all 4 the total price would be 200 50 4 .

The intermediary also comprises a list items tool set which is a set of computer readable instructions that are used by a website or other program hosted by the intermediary to enable a seller to list items an item search tool which is a set of computer readable instructions that are used by the website or other program hosted by the intermediary to enable a buyer or potential buyer to search for browse or otherwise find a single item or multi item stored in the items database and purchase it and an account manager which is any software tool module or program or group or suite of software programs or tools that can be accessed by an administrator for updating the databases and for general maintenance and administration of the system . For example the account manager may be used to manage accounts for buyers and sellers and also advertisers not shown and other partners or entities. Other features accessible to and or used by the intermediary are shown in details of which are explained in the sections below.

The intermediary also has access to or comprises a data storage device or memory hereinafter referred to as the questions help database which stores details to facilitate a user posting an item as described later herein. The database includes various question help tools details of which are explained later. The intermediary also has access to or comprises a data storage device or memory hereinafter referred to as the AlsoFits database which stores information and data pertaining to the fitment and compatibility of items listed on the system . For example a seller lists a fender and specifies that it will fit a 1994 1997 Ford F 150 F 250 and F 350 truck . The AlsoFits database stores this information so that the next time a seller lists a fender that fits that description the system can suggest this compatibility information and allow that seller to include it in their listing to make it easier for buyers to find their item. This is described in more detail later herein. The intermediary also has access to or comprises a data storage device or memory hereinafter referred to as the store front website database which stores information and data pertaining to individual web domains and item catalogues for various sellers . In the examples provided below the web domains are used to provide a store front within the intermediary for the seller to allow them to make their existing store or new store accessible to buyers and to enable the seller to link an existing web site to the system e.g. through the network . For example a seller with an existing website could essentially take their website and plug it into the intermediary creating a virtual extension of their existing website and inventory.

Turning now to further detail of the categorization database is shown. It may be noted that the categorization database and the structure therein is shown conceptually and it will be appreciated that the database may be configured in any format to suit the particular application of the system . Moreover the tools shown therein are also conceptual modules that represent computer executable instructions for utilizing the contents of the categorization database and may or may not run on and or be stored within the database . The categorization database comprises a main category database which in this example directed to auto parts is a comprehensive category and vehicle database created through the amalgamation of the industry standard ACES Part Categories Database PCdb and Vehicle Configuration database VCdb with an intermediary category database and intermediary vehicle database which incorporates any custom specific parts components question database part compatibility database and categorization rules for the specific application. Moreover the main category database may include more ACES database components or other third party databases not shown . It will be appreciated that for other types of items e.g. electronics or consumer items an industry standard may not exist in which case a single database namely the main category database can be created specifically for the intermediary .

The main category database is designed to enable the system to provide for speed ease of use and functionality while at the same time building a comprehensive database of parts and components or other related categorization group names such as accessories as well as a database of parts and part compatibility information related to vehicle makes models years or related to other types of information deemed important by the administrator . For example the main category database may be able to distinguish that an air bag was not available in vehicles in the 1940s or that a part for a particular vehicle can fit other vehicles. The main category database and the system is also designed to evolve and grow into a more detailed database by allowing the administrator buyers sellers and other users to populate the categorization database with data. For example as more sellers list items for sale and include part compatibility information which is stored in the AlsoFits database more user generated content is stored in the system s databases improving the buying searching and selling processes as will be described later herein.

In an effort to build the detailed main category database mass quantities of data needed to be efficiently combined and reorganized. Typical designs for category systems often include only the main category and sub category headings to keep the lists small. For example traditionally users would have chosen a category and sub category that best matched what they were looking for or selling from a general list. The intent of the main category database is to include as much detail as possible to make it easy for users by pre setting the categories and sub categories based on the items specified by the user making the system faster and more user friendly. Continuing with the auto parts example it is known that there are thousands and thousands of items that make up a vehicle so creating categories and sub categories for all of these would result in a gigantic list which would make it very difficult and very time consuming for users to navigate through. This can be particularly true for sellers who may find it difficult to find the appropriate category in which to sell their items. To buyers it can appear to them that the intermediary does not have many items to sell since there may only be a relatively few categories that have many items listed therein when including so many categories and sub categories

This observation identified the need to re evaluate the architecture of the main category database to achieve the following 1 Build a comprehensive database with more item details than any other database and fit it into a small concise category and sub category architecture design 2 Allow sellers to specify what they are selling instead of wasting time finding a category and sub category in which to sell their item 3 Be robust enough to allow large volume sellers and suppliers with massive catalogue inventory data to import their items seamlessly into the intermediary e.g. many sellers and most suppliers have large inventory catalogues or databases of items that they would need to import into the items database . The main category database would allow them to quickly import all of their items and automatically assign the appropriate categories and sub categories based on the items being listed. Considering that some sellers and suppliers have more than 4 million items in their item catalogue database the main category database must be robust and scalable to handle this 4 Make the system easy for buyers to find the needle in the haystack items i.e. be able to find items that are often extremely difficult to find by simple searches on the Internet e.g. auto parts such as plugs trim mouldings clips and fittings 5 Make it easier for sellers and suppliers of smaller and or less common items e.g. starter brushes body clips to post their items on the intermediary 6 Be able to import item listings from other systems and or databases on the network and promote them on the intermediary e.g. item listings from other websites or online stores may be imported and listed on the intermediary to provide better product exposure making the system essentially a portal for all items of its kind. Considering the auto parts example other auto parts websites may export their item listings via RSS XML or other system into the categorization and items databases to be used on the system 7 Find an easier way to keep the categories and sub categories updated when new vehicles and parts are built from vehicles from around the world e.g. ACES only provides data for vehicles marketed in North America and may not include data from vehicles in Europe or Asia etc. The main category database is able to store data from any vehicle. 8 Find an easier and faster way to build up a database of keywords descriptors and part compatibility and 9 Be able to integrate with databases other than ACES to further build up the main category and AlsoFits databases .

As noted above the categorization database incorporates the ACES Part Categories Database PCdb and the ACES Vehicle Configuration Database VCdb with a custom intermediary category database and vehicle database which is either currently being used or comprises application specific or custom categories etc. and blends the databases together to form a scalable category model. In order to achieve what was noted above the ACES and intermediary databases are amalgamated and revised to form the main category design used by the intermediary . This involves renaming hiding and moving ACES assigned categories and sub categories assigned by ACES database administrators into the different categories and sub categories of the intermediary database deemed by the administrator . For example ACES may contain 24 main categories and 177 sub categories in this example that are seen by the user but when amalgamated with the intermediary database they may be reduced to 18 and 129 respectively or any other number that is deemed to be reasonable for the particular application.

Turning now to the categories and sub categories are organized into a tree structure for the sake of illustrating the category design with a Tier a Tier a Tier a Tier Tier and each tier thereafter denoted by the numeral although more or fewer tiers may be used. Each tier is a node in the tree and there may be one or more nodes per tier. Tier represents the main category that allows users to choose from different data sets i.e. Auto Parts Motorcycles Heavy Equipment Construction Equipment etc. . Tier represents the category and Tier represents the sub category. Only the first three tiers made up of the most popular and frequently used categories and sub categories are made visible to users in the click boxes or other selection mechanisms used by users to prevent excessive scrolling and browsing. However the administrator can add a sub category to a sub category not shown if needed. For example if it is deemed necessary by the administrator to further refine the category path Auto Parts Charging Starting Ignition Starters to Auto Parts Charging Starting Ignition Starters Starters and Auto Parts Charging Starting Ignition Starters Starter the administrator could do so. shows another depiction of the categorization system.

Furthermore the main category database combines the Part Terminology data used by the ACES database with Item names in the intermediary database to form Descriptors which are pre set items that buyers and sellers may look for or want to sell. These can be revealed using the auto fill tool or any other tool employed by the system . For example shows the Tier sub category name as Bumpers while the descriptor Tier in this example is a Bumper Bracket . The administrator can assign any descriptors to any number of categories and sub categories as they deem necessary. For example Bumper Assemblies Bumpers Brackets Bumper Absorbers and Bumper Rebars are all auto parts that relate to the sub category Bumpers Tier which relates to the category Body Parts Tier which relates to the Auto Parts Accessories Tier main category. Instead of displaying every bumper descriptor under the Tier bumper sub category and cluttering it up with too much data making it difficult to use they are only displayed in the auto fill tool . illustrates that using the click boxes in this example users only see up to the Bumpers sub category Tier keeping the list concise. However using the auto fill tool the users would be able to see and select one of the descriptors attached to this sub category shown only for illustrative purposes in this Figure . This is explained in subsequent sections. This is particularly helpful for sellers who can type in a descriptor during the selling process and have the system automatically assign the category and sub category for the seller so they do not have to manually choose them like other systems require. If the seller wishes to change the category and sub category after they are automatically assigned they can do so in case they wish to choose another . This increases both speed and usability by making it very convenient for the seller since the system knows which category or sub category the descriptor is associated with. In this way there can be millions of items descriptors with pre set category paths preset by the administrator while maintaining a concise category and sub category list that is easy to use for buyers and sellers minimizing excessive clicking scrolling and reading category line items.

To make the system even easier and more user friendly the administrator can be tasked with classifying each of the 7 044 descriptors in this example from the main category database with a Parts Components or Accessories identifier or any other categorization group name deemed important by the administrator . Components are defined as smaller more granular parts that are combined with other parts to make up one other part assembly referred to as a Part . For example when dealing with auto parts it is realized that starter brushes are components that are found in a starter so the starter would be the Part and the starter brushes would be a Component of the starter. One main purpose of classifying each descriptor as a part component or accessory is to make it easier for the user to choose a descriptor from the auto fill results . Turning to an example of an auto fill result generated by the auto fill tool is shown to illustrate that separating the descriptors into a more readable format is easier for the user. for example shows that typing Car into the auto fill tool would result in a large list of matching carburetor descriptors. If the descriptors were not organized into part component and accessory groups it would be difficult for the user to make their selection from such a large list without excessive reading and scrolling. B and C are shown as examples only and more or fewer descriptor results may be displayed . With the descriptors organized by the administrator the user could simply filter out descriptors by deciding whether they are looking for a part component or accessory thereby eliminating results that do not apply to their needs thus choosing from a smaller more refined list. For example most auto parts users in this example will be looking for a Carburetor displayed in the Parts list of the auto fill list result rather than an uncommon item such as a Carburetor Choke Tube Gasket displayed in the Components list .

As mentioned above the auto fill tool allows users to enter into a user interface UI exactly what they are looking for. For sellers that means they can specify exactly what they are selling rather than have them find a category and sub category to sell their item in. It also allows them to find and list very specific granular items easily and make it easier for buyers to find their items. It has been observed that in many instances sellers spend a great deal of time searching for the right category and sub category when trying to post an item to sell. The categorization database may host millions of descriptors with pre set categories and sub categories so that sellers can quickly choose an item from the auto fill results and let the system do the work to find the category and sub category to list the item in. The auto fill tool works by matching what users are looking for to all of the descriptors in the categorization database and conveniently organizes them into a parts list a components list and an accessories list . In this way it is easier for both the buyer and seller to find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently. In the example shown in by typing Car into an appropriate interface that is linked to the auto fill tool the system extracts the parts components and accessories from the main categorization database that begins with car . The system can be configured to auto fill what the user is typing with most commonly searched parts components or accessories that match what is typed into the auto fill tool. For example shows Carburetor by auto completing car with buretor highlighted portion to allow the user to quickly choose carburetor instead of having them select it from the parts list components list and accessories list . In this example the system recognized carburetor to be the most commonly used match for car therefore it auto filled carburetor . The user can continue typing or press the enter key or other input mechanism to accept the selection. As the user types the results displayed change based on what descriptors the system matches. The parts components and accessories list may be organized in any suitable fashion and the single column of lists shown in are only for illustrative purposes. Another example result is shown in which utilizes a side by side arrangement and like elements are given like numerals with the suffix for clarity. In other embodiments the auto fill tool may classify the auto fill results into other lists such as a Performance list .

The system would be able to preset the categories and sub categories because the parent IDs shown in provide the relationship between the categories and sub categories . Each tier has a unique identification number ID which can be used to link categories in the tree i.e. in a child parent grandparent etc. relationship. By linking the categories and sub categories in this way as also shown in each descriptor can be stored in the database in any location with a tier ID a tier name and a parent ID . A relationship between a descriptor and a category can also be created manually without having to reverse the path using the parent ID .

Turning back to the first three tiers represent the categories and sub categories and tier on represents data pertaining to descriptors. For example Tier contains position details that pertain to the Tier descriptors. For example there can be a right inner right outer left inner and left outer bumper bracket details that further describe the tier item. Tier can therefore add valuable information allowing the seller to provide more details about the item they are selling while providing buyers with more search filter options. Tier n represents infinite tiers of additional information that can be attached to a descriptor.

The system administrator can monitor what sellers are listing and what buyers are searching for and if these items are not found within the main category database the administrator can add them to keep the main category database updated and constantly evolving. For example when sellers are creating a listing for an item that is not found within the auto fill results as will be described in further detail in subsequent sections they can continue typing their item in the What are you selling field. Since the item did not match a descriptor in the main category database the system could not automatically associate the category and sub category to the descriptor. In this case the seller would be forced to manually select a category and sub category to sell their item in. Once they finish listing their item the administrator could review the custom item and decide whether or not to add it to the main category database . If it is added the administrator would review the category and sub category assigned to it by the seller and either keep them assigned or modify them. Finally the new descriptor would need be classified with a Part Component or Accessory identifier. Once it is added the next time a buyer or seller typed that item name in the auto fill tool the main category database would recognize the descriptor and display it in the auto fill results . For example a seller lists a B Switch and since it is not found in the main category database they choose the following category and sub category Auto Parts Modules Sensors Electrical Switches . The administrator then decides to add B Switch to the main category database reviews the category and sub category associated with it and does not change them and finally classifies it with a component identifier. The next time a seller types B Switch in the auto fill it would appear in the auto fill results under Components allowing the user to select it and have the system automatically choose the category path Auto Parts Modules Sensors Electrical Switches .

Each tier contains a group of tables that store other data not found in the ACES databases such as but not limited to a list of keywords alternate names spelling variations of the tier name and other information deemed important by the administrator to improve the overall functionality of the system . For example the administrator may change the name of an ACES category sub category or descriptor to better fit the main category database but will store the original ACES name in the keyword table. For example a descriptor from the ACES database called Air Mass Flow Sensor Meter is the correct name of this auto part but the administrator knows that the part is commonly referred to as a Mass Air Flow . In order to improve the searching buying and selling processes the descriptor name is changed to Mass Air Flow and the keyword phrase Air Mass Flow Sensor Meter is added to the keyword table. The next time users type Air Mass Flow Sensor Meter the system can understand it and display Mass Air Flow in the auto fill results . Furthermore the administrator can be tasked with adding spelling variations to categories sub categories descriptors vehicles etc and storing them in the questions help database . For example adding Senser as a spelling variation to the descriptor Sensor will allow the system to understand that when users type in senser they mean sensor . Another example would be to add alternate names and spelling combinations for vehicles to greatly increase the usability of the system . For example if a user types Plimoth incorrect spelling the system could understand it as Plymouth the correct spelling if the administrator added Plimoth as an alternate name for Plymouth.

The administrator is able to rename anything in the ACES database because no IDs are changed when doing this to preserve the integrity of the ACES database data. This makes updating the ACES databases simple because the IDs are used in update process. For example assume the ACES descriptor Engine Harmonic Balancer with the ID was renamed in the main category database as Harmonic Balancer . The ID remains . Even if the ACES database if updated the revised descriptor name does not change and if sellers or suppliers wanted to import their data using the ACES standards even though names would be different the data would be successfully imported into the system by using the IDs.

Since the ACES database is continually updated and the intermediary category database may also need to be updated the categorization database is in this example capable of receiving and processing updates for the individual databases for ACES and for the website intermediary . In this way the original sources of the categories can be updated per the usual while the main category database can be updated by simply creating a new amalgamation of the updated databases . For example the databases can be kept separate and the ACES database updated by downloading the latest update from a central ACES website and refreshing the data. The intermediary category database can be customized and updated at any time by the administrator or using batch updates or any other schedule. A script can then be used to merge the changes to both databases and the administrator can review the final update to validate the integrity of the main category database . Various tests can be employed if desired and then the main category database can be released to the website. In order to update the databases an admin tool can be provided that can be used by the administrator as needed. As can also be seen in a search tool and an auto fill tool are provided with access to the main category database . Currently ACES is updated monthly for those who subscribe and as such a script or a custom tool that runs automatically such as the admin tool can be used so the ACES and intermediary categories can be updated easily and seamlessly.

When updating and amalgamating the ACES and intermediary databases there may be some duplication with category sub category descriptor and vehicle names or other duplicate content. For example if the administrator added the descriptor Cylinder Head to the intermediary database and two months later when the ACES database was updated they too added Cylinder Head the administrator can be tasked with merging the data together.

Furthermore relationships between different tables in the ACES database that previously did not exist may be formed by the administrator thereby making the ACES database within the main category database more detailed than it originally was. For example the ACES Vehicle Configuration database VCdb tracks some of the year make and model information for vehicles marketed in North America and contains some common information about the engine size body structure 2 door 4 door etc. transmission type manual automatic etc. etc. However the ACES database does not form relationships between auto parts and vehicles so their database for example cannot distinguish that an airbag was not available in vehicles built in the 1940s. The administrator can setup these relationships to create a more comprehensive and detailed database within the categorization database than ACES originally provided. These relationships can be used to assist in filtering searches by eliminating parts from models for years when they did not exist etc. For other types of items any industry available equivalent to the ACES PCdb and VCdb can be used to provide a similar function.

The ACES category database is one most commonly used Industry Standard for the management and exchange of automotive catalogue and vehicle data in the United States. With ACES sellers and suppliers who are ACES compliant following the ACES industry standards can publish automotive data with standard coded designations for vehicle attributes parts classifications and qualifier statements. ACES provides a machine readable format XML for trading partners to use in exchanging vast amounts of information. The Electronic Commerce Committee of the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association develops standards and best practices to lower costs throughout the aftermarket and increase the efficiency of supply chain technology. The committee recognized that part availability inquiries and associated special order transactions occurred many thousands of times each day at all levels of the aftermarket. These transactions were conducted by phone fax and a growing number of negotiated electronic transaction formats. In the interest of providing an open industry guideline for this business process the AAIA committee identified the ACES standards and a workgroup was formed from interested parties. The Internet parts ordering standards in the document produced were developed with broad industry participation. It can therefore be seen that by leveraging off of one of the industry standards for categorization the main category database can be designed to be simpler to use but still utilize the vast amounts of data developed for ACES. Furthermore the administrator may integrate other database standards such as the Internet Parts Ordering standards developed from the AAIA the Hollander Interchange platform from Solera etc. and amalgamate them into the main category database using the same techniques as described in previous sections.

The intermediary enables buyers and sellers to transact with each other over the network by hosting a program application or website. illustrates a main screen for a website UI . In this example the website UI is accessed by entering a URL through a browser connected to the Internet the URL being associated with the intermediary . The website UI comprises various main navigation options in this example a home link which allows the user to return to the main screen shown in at any time a Buy link which when selected initiates a buying process for a buyer a Sell link which when selected initiates a selling process for a seller i.e. to post or list one or more items a My Account link which when selected accesses account information and enables a user to log in to their account or set up a new account etc. a Search entry box which enables a user to enter text for conducting a quick search at any time which is initiated by selecting a Search button Make Model and Year drop downs which enables users to search based on the make model and year of their vehicle initiated by clicking the search button not shown a Stores Link which when selected allows the user to browse and search through sellers items and item catalogues from sellers stores a Wanted Link which when selected allows the user to view items requested by other users and allows sellers to post requested items to the items database a Videos Link which when selected brings the user to pages that display Do It Yourself How To instructional educational and other videos related to the system an AlsoFits Link which when selected allows the user to access part compatibility information pertaining to items a Tool link which provides access to other tools and applications a Help Link that when selected allows the user to access help files pertaining to the use of the system a Register Link which when selected initiates a registration module and a Sign In Link which when selected provides access to the registration sign in page shown in . In other embodiments the navigation options may expand to include additional tabs not depicted here and may have different names than shown in these Figures. Other Figures may only display some tabs for illustrative purposes only. The main screen shown in can be used to provide banners for advertisements and messages and may comprise different portions or panes that provide links and featured items . Also the main screen may allocate a portion for assisting the user in getting started e.g. with preliminary instructions or helpful tips. Moreover illustrates extra links and features that are available throughout the system although they may not be depicted in other Figures.

Turning now to a registration sign in screen is shown which may be initiated upon selecting the account link or sell link or using any other feature that requires users to be signed into their account. For users that have already registered standard username and password entry boxes and a sign in button collectively referred to as a sign in tool by numeral can be filled in by typing the appropriate username and password and selecting the sign in button. If a user has not yet registered they can select the register button which then initiates a registration module not shown e.g. run by the admin tool to gather the appropriate user information. Messages may also be displayed to provide an advertisement or system message encouraging users to register if they haven t done so or to upgrade to premium services etc.

Other tabs in this example such as Replacement Parts Accessories Performance Parts Accessories Vintage Parts not shown Racing Parts not shown etc. can perform the same type of search as the View All Parts Accessories tab however the results return only items that match the specific attributes the tab is assigned. An attribute is a particular characteristic of the item assigned by the seller during the selling process. When a seller tags their item with an attribute the system then adds that item to a special group of items based on the attribute to give buyers more searching options. For example clicking the Blower Motors sub category link on the Performance Parts Accessories tab would display all Performance blower motors posted in the items database that are available that is all blower motors with the performance attribute. It may be noted that an attribute in this example is not a new category but simply a flag given to an item that can be searched and filtered. This will be explained in more detail when describing the single item selling tools. Other tabs may perform similar functions but search different items. For example the Parts Vehicles tab is an example of a search page dedicated to searching multi items . Buyers can also post items they are looking for on the Wanted Board to allow sellers to view items requested by other users and use the Parts Alert tool not shown to post a requested item to the items database and notify the buyer that a matching part is available. The Browse by Vehicle Make Model tab offers users an alternative way to search for items by vehicle make and model. Buyers can use the advanced search tools by clicking the Use the Advanced Search Tools link which loads the advanced search page shown in .

The advanced search page shown in presents more search filters and auto fill search tools so that users can further refine their search. For example a user may want to search for items only in a particular country and or search for items priced under 50. The buyers can also use the click boxes with the first click box containing the first tier of categories and when a user selects that category the next pane displays a more detailed breakdown of it. Users can simply click on the contents in the left pane to get a more detailed list in the right pane. The further to the right you go the more detailed your search will be. Stay to the left and the more general your search will be. These click boxes display only up to three tiers in this example. The top row in the click boxes contain the categories and sub categories while the bottom boxes contain in this example vehicles or other related information. The users can mix and match their search criteria to perform broad or very detailed searches. For example one user may want to search for a fender for their 1987 Honda Civic by selecting the sub category fender from the top third click box and choosing a 1987 Honda Civic from the bottom click boxes . Another user may want to search all Body Exterior items listed for their Civic by only choosing the Body Exterior category from the above boxes and selecting Honda Civic from the first two bottom boxes . Notice that no year was selected so the search will pull up all Body Exterior results for all years of Honda Civics. The search is activated by clicking the search button not shown . The user can also click the Use the Quick Finder link to load the vehicle quick finder tool as will be explained later.

The user may want to use the What are you looking for search box to use the auto fill tool and access a detail descriptor list explained earlier. After the user selects a descriptor from the auto fill result they can add more search criteria or execute the search by clicking the search button not shown . For example if a user typed in Starter and selected Starter Brushes from the auto fill result and clicked the search button the system searches for all starter brushes. If additional search criteria such as the item price must be less than 50 was added clicking the search button would search for all Starter Brushes with a price less than 50. Users can also use the links on the side menu not shown to quickly search for items. The Match Exact Vehicle Only and Include Compatible Vehicles in Search options allow the user to search for items that fit their exact vehicle or search for items that are from different vehicles but still compatible with the vehicle the user selected. In other words the second search filter will search for items from other vehicles that Also Fit their vehicle. Users can still use the search bar and the vehicle drop downs at the top of the page to find items as explained earlier. Other search filters include description in search keywords year range condition price range currency location payment method and shipping options are available to the user at the bottom of the page to refine their search. Other search filters will offer similar functionality. The user can return to the simple search page by clicking the Use the Simple Search Tools link

If the user is registered the screen shown in may be displayed by clicking the Account Link . The user s account page can be divided into an information pane and a message pane . The information pane is broken up into different sections. The Dashboard displays summary information from various account pages The Mailbox is where they can send and receive messages from other users My Account allows the users to manage their account information and add the vehicles they drive in this example to their profile so that the system can automatically search for and present the user with all items related to their vehicle without the user having to manually search for them Sales and Orders allows sellers to manage their sales and orders similar to the features shown in Manage Inventory allows sellers to manage their inventory as shown in Buying allows buyers to review their purchases view their saved searches and review items they posted to the Wanted Board and the My Seller Account allows sellers to manage their seller account setup their selling preferences setup their PayPal Google Checkout and other payment processors accounts and make payments to the system for charges related to their account. The message pane provides a UI for the user to view messages from buyers and create their own messages which provides a convenient communication tool within the system . The message pane displays the appropriate details from the information pane . For example if the user chooses to edit their account information by selecting the link in the My Account information pane they would make the change in the message pane on the right. If users are not registered they can access a similar account page not shown dedicated to Guest users with certain options restricted. For example an unregistered user or a user not signed in may be able to add vehicles to their Guest account view messages sent from sellers save their custom searches add items to their Watch List etc. The system uses a combination of programming and cookies to allow this functionality.

Once users activate their seller account a list of options may then be provided such as to allow the seller to setup their selling preferences defaults as shown in . Referring also to the selling preferences can be listed under My Seller Account or can be presented to the user automatically during the registration setup or the seller account setup. As can be seen in the selling preferences can comprise any suitable details that the user may use more than once thus a default. In this example the following default types are shown a condition such as used very good used excellent etc. b payment details which may be selected from a standard list and may allow the user to select all along with payment instructions which enables the user to add a textual set of instructions to assist the buyer c currency to enable the user to select a default currency in which to transact d shipping details including handling time shipping notes and insurance which allows the user to preset the type of insurance they wish to add such as required optional etc. e a warranty and return policy which allows the user to specify if and how to return items and if a warranty or particular period applies and other details pertaining to the returns.

The shipping details include drop down boxes in this example in which the seller can preset how they will ship items to buyers in the United States Canada and Internationally . The seller has various options to choose from as will be explained later in the selling process. shows a similar selling preferences page only accessible to Non Canadian and Non US sellers. An extra shipping location Seller s Country is available that matches the country the seller is located in. For example if the seller is from Australia the drop down will display Australia to allow the Australian seller to specify how they will ship the item to buyers in their country. Seller s Country appears in as an illustration only and will be replaced by the actual name of the country the Non US Non Canadian seller is located in.

A Back button allows the user to return to their account page and a Save button enables the user to save the selected preferences in whatever the current state of the defaults page happens to be. By setting defaults the user s choices can be automatically populated during the selling process when creating a new listing allowing the user to save additional time.

At any later time the user should be able to click on My Selling Preferences in their My Seller Account to be taken to the selling preferences setup page shown in and or B to allow the user to modify and or update their default preferences. The selling preferences screen can use radio buttons drop down boxes and text boxes and any other input mechanism to allow the user to select or specify a default preference. Users should be able to setup all of the default options if they wish setup some of the default options or not setup anything if they do not wish to utilize any defaults. If they do not wish to add any selling preferences they would choose the Back button . Once they enter a selling preference they would choose the Save button to save their changes and return to their account page e.g. that shown in . Similarly the seller can save their preferences when selling an item as discussed below.

As noted above the selling preferences can be used during the listing process to allow the user to save time by utilizing common options and preferences. When sellers are listing an item whatever preferences have been previously setup will automatically appear in a users listing. For example User A has setup his Payment Details to accept Payment Method A B and E. A few days later User A begins to list an item and the Payment Method A B and E are automatically pre selected for convenience.

The sellers should be able to view and modify their selling details during the sell process at any time by clicking on an option to view and modify the selling details. If the user selects such an option they would then see the UI display their selling details to view and or modify similar to what is shown in . When a user is listing an item and the system populates the fields with the user s default settings the user should still be able to change any of the options. For example if User A had previously set his preferred shipping method to Canada as Contact Seller and has listed a new item that should be configured to offer Free Shipping User A can simply change the shipping method for Canada to Free Shipping. This will not change his selling preferences unless the user decides to update their preferences during the listing process. For example presetting the shipping method to the United States with Free Shipping was an error so User A changes that to Calculated Shipping. To change it for all future listings that is to change their preference an option should be available to update the selling preferences within the sell page using the currently selected selling details rather than having User A return to their account page and select the selling preferences link.

It may be noted that other options and restrictions can be incorporated e.g. where multiple sellers are introduced. In such a case a restriction can be set such that only the account administrator i.e. a selected one of the sellers can set selling preferences. This can be done to minimize concurrency issues e.g. when there are multiple users acting for the same entity. When having multiple users the account should allow multiple items to be listed at the same time using the same preferences.

When a user selects the Sell link through the main navigation portion of the UI a main sell menu page may be initiated as shown in . The main sell menu page allows the user to select from various selling formats. In this example a single item may be listed by selecting the List an Item option and a multi item may be listed by selecting the List a Multi Item option . As can also be seen in and which will be described later the user may also select the Create a Bin option to start the bin selling process. The Bulk Upload Items option allows sellers to post a large volume of items at one time from a spreadsheet or other resource. A Parts Catalogue option can also be selected which allows a seller to create a digital catalogue for their items and multi items etc. import their entire product inventory into the items database and allow sellers and suppliers to utilize the Part a Log features as will be described later. The system can also be configured to connect to the seller s product catalogue through an API application programming interface provided by the system and or the seller to keep the seller s product inventory updated in real time. The Build Your Store option allows the seller to create and configure their virtual store within the intermediary and set up parameters and promotional materials e.g. for users who wish to utilize the system for posting selling and buying items on behalf of an organization such as a store or other business.

A Product Advertising option can be selected to allow sellers or administrators of other websites or systems to integrate and or promote their item listings from their website into the items database and the system . For example ABC Company may have their own website but may want to use the intermediary to promote their items and generate more sales by listing all of their items in the intermediary s items database . The system can be configured to generate revenue from sending referrals from the intermediary to the seller s own website or store and or charge a commission fee for sales generated from buyers who found the seller s item on the items database but purchased the item from the seller on the seller s own website. Various help pages and instructions can assist the seller with choosing an option. A test drive link allows a user to try out the selling tools without posting anything to the items database . A Continue Selling Your Saved Listing link allows the seller to continue a saved listing. The system can be configured to include more or less options than illustrated in .

The main sell menu page can be configured to show all options available to a particular seller . For example if a seller does not have a particular account type or membership required to use one of the features that feature can be omitted or greyed out with a message telling them they must upgrade their account to use the feature. This provides an avenue to create awareness for the different products and always encourage users to upgrade their accounts.

An example of the single items selling process is now described which enables the user to quickly and efficiently list or post items in much less time than previous listing processes. The process comprises specifying the item being sold which the system can automatically preselect the best category and sub category the item should be sold in as explained earlier adding records details uploading pictures and or video and sending the item to the system . The selling page is organized into different sections to ensure the user enters all important information about their item in one area minimizing time effort and scrolling operations. In this way the user is given a certain amount of control over the selling process while keeping the process consistent and in a logical work flow.

In the following example once the user selects the List an Item selling option they are directed to the sell page shown in . Everything the seller needs has been arranged onto one page to minimize scrolling and clicking and organized into different sections for convenience. The page is broken up into two main areas The required details pane and the optional details pane . The required details pane contains details the seller must complete in order to post the item to the items database . The optional details pane is where the user can add extra optional details to better describe the item for sale. It is also where the system can add different applications and utilize third party applications. For example the Vehicle Details tab will utilize the AlsoFits application explained later to provide part compatibility data data about other vehicles the item is compatible with . The user can save the listing by selecting the Save button so they can complete it at another time. Saved listings appear in the main sell menu page under the Continue Selling Your Saved Listing link shown in . During the selling process the seller may at any time preview their listing by selecting the Preview Finish button and can proceed to list or post the item or can abort the current listing by selecting the Cancel button .

The administrator can modify the details in the required and optional detail panes by making global changes that it for all types of items or can modify the requirements for different descriptors. For example some electronics such as relays or switches may require the seller to add a part number to their listing whereas a fender would not require this.

The optional details pane comprises one or more tabs that can be configured e.g. using AJAX Asynchronous Javascript and XML to prevent page refreshes when the appropriate tab is selected in the optional details pane . Examples of suitable tabs for auto parts includes without limitation Item Details Vehicle Details Shipping Payment and Photos . The required details pane may also comprise a tabbed configuration not shown .

When the user first arrives at the sell page as shown in they may be given the opportunity to upload one or more pictures immediately by clicking either the Click here to upload link in the photo preview box or by clicking the Photos tab to direct the user to the upload photos tools. If any photos have been uploaded the first photo will be contained in the photo preview box with the ability to edit the photos at any time. Allowing the seller to upload their photos at any time in the selling process adds to the uniqueness of the selling tool. It has been found that by having a photo available to the user for referencing during the selling process makes it easier for the user to describe what it is they are selling. In this way the seller can upload the photos of the item before beginning to create the listing. This also allows the user to continually refer back to the photos as they are attempting to describe it for the listing. If the seller has uploaded more than one photo the system may be configured to display Next and Previous buttons not shown to allow the seller to browse through the different photos without leaving the required details pane.

It has been recognized that the categorization of parts components and accessories described above can be used to assist the user in finding and selecting categories and sub categories in particular when selling an item. As described earlier traditional selling processes often require that sellers have to manually choose a category and sub category that best matches the item they are selling which can take time and may require many page refreshes. These traditional listing processes have been found to not be particularly intuitive and may be considerably slow especially when a seller does not know what category their item falls under. The auto fill tool allows the seller to type in the exact item they are selling and if that item matches a descriptor in the main category database the system can automatically choose the category and sub category that best fits their item in one simple step. When the sell page loads the user can immediately begin typing what they are selling in the What are you selling auto fill box . shows one use of the auto fill result in the inline orientation. As explained earlier the system will automatically provide a list of descriptor items that best match what they are typing and organizes them into a Parts Components Accessories and Performance list. The user may continue typing what it is they are selling e.g. carburetor engine assembly etc. and the auto fill result will automatically update displaying the closest matching descriptor results as the typing continues.

Using the cursor keys or any other appropriate input or selection mechanism the user would be able to select an item. For example shows a seller typing Car and the auto fill tool automatically highlights Carburetor in the What are you selling field . The user can hit the Enter key to accept carburetor. If they wanted to choose Carburetor Float they could continue typing the phrase until it matches the descriptor or use the arrow down key to select it from the drop down list. The descriptor lists and can shrink or expand depending on what the user types and how many matches are found. It may be noted that various parameters may be used such as requiring the user to type at least a certain number of characters before creating the auto fill result .

For scenarios where the user types an item into the What are you selling field that is not found in the categorization database no auto fill results are shown and the user can continue typing. When an auto generated category and sub category cannot be pre selected the seller must manually choose them using any suitable search tools such as a series of click boxes as shown in . The click boxes automatically appear so the user can choose where to list their item. Once the user has chosen their category and sub category they can either click the Hide Categories link or navigate to one of the other fields such as condition to automatically hide the click boxes . If the user wants to view the click boxes again they could click the Browse Categories link shown in to load the click boxes . Once the user chooses their category and sub category the category path is displayed above the Browse Categories link not shown to show the user which category their item will be placed in. This information can then be tracked and stored so that the administrator can determine whether to update the main category database by adding a new category sub category descriptor or other maintenance task. For example if the user typed in Zender plug nothing would appear in the auto fill results list because in this example Zender plug is not found in the main category database and therefore the category and sub category cannot be pre selected by the system . The user would need to choose them e.g. Auto Parts Accessories Module Switches Wiring Other or another suitable category . If the administrator adds this information to the main category database the next time a user types in Zen Zender plug would appear in the auto fill results and the system would be able to pre select the category and sub category for the user.

Additional embodiments may present the seller with pictures of parts and or vehicles either from the system s custom database or by a third party data provider not shown . For example the user may view a picture of a vehicle and click the headlight in the picture to automatically fill in the What are you selling field with headlight and its associated category and sub category . The auto fill tool also utilizes the incorrect spelling database . This can be particularly helpful to a user that has misspelt their item name. For example if the seller typed in O2 Sensir the system can still display O2 Sensor in the auto fill result by utilizing the incorrect spelling database . Although they spelt it incorrectly they can choose the correct spelling from auto fill result . The system can also be configured to automatically correct the misspelled word phrase after the seller types it.

Once the user specifies what they are selling and chooses a category if the system did not do it automatically for them they are brought to the condition field. The condition drop down list would display the condition the user preset in their selling preferences if the seller previously set it up. In this case the user does not have to select anything further. If they did not save their condition in their selling preferences the user would use a mouse arrow keys or other input mechanism to make their selection from the drop down list. Some examples of conditions that can be selected may include without limitation Used Excellent Used Very Good Used Good Used Fair Used Poor New OEM Original Equipment Manufacturer New Aftermarket etc.

Referring back to the user may be required to add a headline for their listing. The headline is one of the first details users see when the item appears in the results page shown in . Other required details in the required details pane include but are not limited to the item price the quantity of items for sale the quantity type in which the seller can specify if they are selling a case a lot a palette of items etc. and a description of the item. The user must also specify how they wish to be paid from buyers . If the user preset the methods of payment during their selling preferences then the methods of payment shown in the sell page would be preselected. If not the user would be required to choose one or more methods of payment from the click boxes . Finally in this example the user is required to specify shipping information. If the seller preset their shipping preferences then they could disregard this requirement unless they wanted to modify their shipping options. If they did not preset their shipping preferences the system would automatically configure the listing with Contact Seller as the shipping method for all locations and . The Contact Seller method as will be explained in more detail later requires buyers to contact the seller for shipping quotes to their location. This is done to make the listing process very quick and easy. If the seller wants to add shipping details for this listing they would click the Add Shipping Details link to bring them to the Shipping Payment tab . This is explained below.

Referring to the quantity field if the user wants to sell more than one identical item in the same listing they could enter a quantity greater than one. Depending on how many items the user enters into the quantity field and what price they entered in the price field a message may be displayed to ensure their listing is correct. For example assuming that User A entered a quantity of 4 with a price of 65 the message may be I am selling 4 items for 65 each that would total 260 if all items are purchased . This prevents the scenario of a user that enters a quantity of 4 with a price of 65 who wants to sell all 4 rims for 65 not 260.

The item details tab contains extra details in the item details pane the user may want to add to their listing. Item Details A B C Private Notes and Other Details Options and Information illustrate examples of fields where the seller may enter more details. The optional details pane may include the following details but is not limited to brand part numbers sku numbers and private notes. They can be added selected etc. using various tools or entry mechanisms known in the art as exemplified above e.g. auto fill lists entry boxes click boxes drop down lists etc.

One particular unique option allows the user to tag the item s Attributes . As explained earlier an attribute is a particular characteristic of the item and is not a new category but a flag given to items for searching purposes. When a seller tags their item with an attribute identifier the item is automatically added to a tab in the Buy page once the item is posted. For example User A chooses the Performance Parts attribute. Once their item is posted the item becomes searchable on the Performance Parts tab in the Buy page. The administrator can dynamically add edit or remove attributes from the item details pane which in turn automatically changes the Buy pages tabs . For example if the administrator adds a Vintage Parts athibute not shown in a Vintage Parts tab would appear on the Buy page and all items flagged with that identifier would be listed therein. The seller can add more than one attribute to their item. For example User A may choose to add Performance Racing and Custom Built attributes to their listing so their item would appear in three different tabs in the Buy page. This makes it easy for buyers to find parts. If they are looking for racing items they could look under Racing Parts etc. Some examples of attributes appropriate for auto parts may include without limitation performance parts vintage parts racing parts classic parts custom built etc.

If the user wants to navigate to the next tab in the optional details pane in this example Vehicle Details they could either click the tab or click the Next button . shows Vehicle Details tab which allows the user to add vehicle part compatibility data to their listing and associate the item they are posting to a particular vehicle or group of vehicles so that when a buyer searches for their item the system will search through the item s part compatibility data that the seller has provided to find a match. If there is a match the listing would appear in the search results. One of the main benefits of adding this information is to make it easier for buyers to find sellers items. For example if User A specified that their fender will fit a 1990 1994 Ford Tempo and 1990 1994 Ford Topaz buyers would have eight ways in this example to find the fender because there are four model years for two vehicles that the buyer can choose from. If the seller specified that their fender only fit a 1992 Ford Tempo for the buyer to find the fender they would have to search specifically for a 1992 Ford Tempo. Searching for a 1991 1993 or 1994 Tempo or a 1990 1994 Topaz would not match the seller s item and therefore not appear in the search results. It can be seen that the more part compatibility data that sellers add to their listing the greater the probability of their listings appearing in buyers search results.

This tool allows the user to quickly and efficiently add vehicle fitment data by simply copying it from another source e.g. their catalogue website etc. and pasting it into the AlsoFits box located in the Vehicle Details pane . This also allows the user to add large amounts of data into their listing quickly without them having to add it individually one at a one time. The compatibility data is stored in the AlsoFits database . illustrates that the seller has added 12 different compatibility data rows for their item. For example the first two rows indicate that their item will fit a 1994 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva with a 3.1 L engine as well as a 1990 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier. The AlsoFits database allows the seller to add their data in different formats i.e. make model year range notes model year notes etc. and then parses the data and stores it in the AlsoFits database and in the seller s listing so that it is searchable to all buyers using all the search tools available to them i.e. click boxes text searches make model and year drop downs etc. . Data that is not readable either because the vehicle is not found in the main category database or because it is not in a format accepted by the system is added to the item description so that it can remain searchable using text searches . The system administrator can review all the non readable data and analyze it to determine if another format should be acceptable. The administrator can then add the different format logic to the AlsoFits database so the next time a seller adds data in that format it will be understandable by the system .

The advanced vehicle details page shown in is accessible by clicking the Advanced link shown in . This allows the seller to add vehicle part compatibility data one by one into the individual make model year range sub model and note fields. Each field except for the notes utilizes the auto fill tool that in this scenario is directly connected to the vehicle portion of the main category database that is the auto fill searches vehicle related data not descriptors. This page also utilizes the auto fill in the Quick Finder tool which provides advanced searching capabilities for both simple matching and advanced queries. In particular the Quick Finder can search and cross reference years makes models sub models and types car truck van etc. from the main category database with one another and display the matching results quickly. For example the seller may type 08 Honda in the Quick Finder and it would display all models and sub models available for 2008 Honda s. Another example would be typing in d elegance would display Cadillac Brougham D Elegance where Cadillac is the make Brougham is the model and D Elegance is the sub model. This is very useful when sellers may not know the actual model name of their vehicle but know the sub model as exemplified in the D Elegance example. Each time the seller arrives to the Advanced Vehicle Details page the cursor flashes in the Quick Finder allowing the seller to immediately begin adding their data. In the example in the seller typed Acc and the auto fill result displayed a matching list of results for Acc . The seller selected Honda Accord using the arrow and enter keys or other input mechanism. shows that after the seller chooses a result from the quick finder results list the available data pre fills in the appropriate fields in the data rows . In this example the make and model are pre filled. If the seller added the year to their search criteria the year would have been pre filled as well. For example if the seller typed 98 Acc the quick finder would have displayed 1998 Honda Accord in the results list and if the seller selected this the year field would have pre filled with 1998. If the seller searches for and selects another vehicle from Quick Finder results list the results would pre fill in the next empty data row in the data fields . The quick finder results can be configured to add more or less details than illustrated in these examples.

The seller does not have to use the quick finder to enter their data they can enter it individually field by field. For example to enter a make the seller would type into the make field to enter a model they would type it into the model field etc. shows the sequential work flow of the seller adding the data field by field. In this example the seller begins to type a year in the from year field and since the make and model are found within the main category database the auto fill displays a list of years that match the make and model. The user could arrow down and use the enter key to make their selection as explained in earlier sections. If the seller wants to add a year range they can enter a second year in the to year field and display another results list . This allows the seller to add a year range such as 2007 2009 to their listing. The AlsoFits database will therefore understand that the item in this example will fit a 2007 2008 and 2009 Honda Accord. If the seller wants to add a sub model they could begin typing in the sub model field or as shown in the Figure not type anything and use the arrow down key to see all the corresponding sub models available for that make model and year range . The system is intuitive to know not display sub models that were not available for the specified criteria make model and year range .

If the seller wants to add data not found in the auto fill results they may type it in and disregard the auto fill results . This is illustrated in the model field. Notice that the seller chose Chevrolet from the make results list in the second data row but no auto fill results appeared for the model name Cruisinmobile . This is because the model name Cruisinmobile did not match a Chevrolet model name in the main category database however the seller was still able to enter their custom name. This is very useful in the event that a make model year etc. is not found within the main category database . The seller can navigate between fields by using the tab key or other method.

Similar to the process for determining what the user is selling the system may record the compatibility data so that the administrator could decide whether to add the vehicle data to the main category database so that the next time a user types in for example Cruisin in the model field associated with Chevrolet Cruisinmobile would be displayed in the auto fill result list not shown . The user could continuously use the Quick Finder tool to add vehicle data to the fields in the next empty row. For example in if the user searched for and selected a vehicle from the Quick Finder the vehicle data would be added to the third data row because it is empty. If the user wants to add more vehicle rows they could click the Add more vehicles link to add more rows. The system may be configured to include a delete button not shown to remove data rows.

Referring now to the user could also click the Browse Vehicles link shown in to display the click boxes allowing the seller to browse through the list of vehicles stored in the main category database as explained in the Buy page. To hide the click boxes the seller would click the Hide Vehicles link. In this example the seller has selected Honda from the make click box Accord from the model click box 2009 from the year click box and LX from the sub model click box . Once the seller has made their choices they may be required to click the Add link to add the data from the click boxes into their appropriate places in the data fields . It can be seen that sellers have a wide variety of unique tools at their disposal.

Other AlsoFits tools discussed later herein can also be used to allow the seller to specify compatibility data suggested by other users. For example a compatibility list accumulated from multiple sellers data may be presented to the seller in the vehicle details tab so they could quickly attach the other sellers suggested compatibility data without them having to re enter it. For example once a seller specifies that a fender fits a 1987 1991 Ford F 150 F 250 and F 350 pick up truck when another seller creates a listing to sell a fender that matches this criteria the compatibility data the first seller added appears allowing the second seller to add this data to their listing quickly without them having to re enter the same data the first seller did.

The use of the auto fill tools and the Quick Finder can be particularly advantageous. For example assume User A types Ford in the make field or selects it from the Make click box when browsing vehicles then tries to find Topaz in the model field or model click box . They would not find Topaz because Topaz is manufactured by Mercury part of the parent company of Ford which may cause the confusion . This may cause frustration and reduce the user s experience. Using the quick finder the user could type in Topaz and find Mercury Topaz from the auto fill results list . The main category database knows this information from the ACES and intermediary databases . This method reduces the discrepancies with different manufactures that are part of the same corporation. For example Ford and Mercury or GMC and Chevrolet are different divisions of the same corporation.

The auto fill tool and the Quick Finder can be configured to recognize years in various ways. For example it can be configured such that the user can either type in the first two digits of the year e.g. 19 or simply the last two digits of the year to show the year results e.g. 90 . For example by typing 90 the system will recognize it as either 1990 and or 1890. Other considerations may be made such as the reoccurrence of short hands like 02 when a century changes. For auto parts the digits of the years 2000 and forward may appear as 00 01 02 etc. There should not be issues with confusing 02 between 1902 and 2002 since the make and model names available in 2002 would be different than those in 1902.

When implementing the system for auto parts a few considerations may be noted. For instance if the user skips the make and model fields and enters a year in the year field then returns to the make and model fields the system should be configured to only list makes and models that were available in that year. For example if a user typed 1987 in the year field and types Ford in the make field and C in the model field the results list will show Crown Victoria. If the year was entered as 1995 the model results list adds Ford Contour since the Ford Contour was first manufactured in that year. This feature is particularly advantageous as it prevents users from searching for parts for a vehicle that did not exist in the chosen year. Parameters can be set to control how results are displayed. For example users may be required to type at least one character before the auto fill result will display. It may also be noted that the placement of the fields can be made to guide the user through the listing process and avoid common pitfalls. In the auto parts example the make and model fields appear before the Year field . This is because it has been recognized that users often make more mistakes with the year than with the make or model. For example if a user chooses 1995 as the year of their vehicle Tempo the model will not appear in the results since it stopped being made in 1994. Information of this kind can be determined from the categorization database .

Referring to the headline field the system may be configured to automatically generate a sub headline to improve searching as shown in . For example if User A entered the following data What are you selling Fan Blade Make Mazda Model B2000 Year 1986 Condition Used Good the auto generated sub headline could be 1986 Mazda B2000 Fan Blade Used Good as shown in the second result in . The sub headline can therefore be used as a secondary title allowing the user to give more information about the item and thus improving searching. If the seller specified that their vehicle can fit more than one year the auto generated sub headline can be configured to show the year range as shown in the first result in 1980 85 Chevrolet Malibu . . . . Furthermore the auto generated sub headline can improve searching especially when a seller makes spelling mistakes in their headline or leaves out important information. For example the first listing in shows the seller spelt Malibu incorrectly. If a buyer searched for Malibu this result may not have appeared because the seller typed Malebu . As well the seller in this example typed Chv as a short form for Chevrolet . Most buyers will not search for the term Chv they would search Chevrolet . However because the auto generated sub headline included the full spelling for Chevrolet and spelt Malibu correctly the listing would appear in the search results. Another example can be seen at the last listing shown in . The seller in this example did not include any vehicle details so a buyer s search would likely not find this listing. The auto generated sub headline automatically included the vehicle data so the listing would be searchable. It can therefore be seen that as more detail is entered into the listing the system can intelligently assist the user by creating automatically generated details.

If the seller added part compatibility data to the listing as explained above an AlsoFits button would appear in the listing results allowing users to either mouse over or click the button to display the also fits information box showing the part compatibility details. This makes it easy for the buyer to determine if that item would fit their application.

Continuing with the auto parts example once vehicle data is added in the vehicle details tab the system may present the seller with additional vehicle and or item questions derived from the questions database giving the seller the option to add more details to describe their item. Questions regarding Engine size Body Style the type of Transmission are some general examples. It should be noted that the terms questions and questions database are general terms used to encapsulate questions features options etc. and does not necessarily mean that the seller will be asked a question . They may be presented with a list of options and asked to choose any of the options that pertain to their item. For example if the seller is creating a listing for a door the seller may be asked to specify if the door is from a two door or four door vehicle or they may be presented with a list of options such as power windows manual windows front door rear door etc. The seller could then choose which of those options pertain to their item. Further detail can be displayed that combine the vehicle data provided by the seller and the descriptor to form specific targeted questions for that exact item and vehicle. For example if a seller is selling an engine from a 1990 Ford F 150 the system may ask the seller if their engine size is 4.9 L 5.0 L or 5.8 L. Some questions and answers may be extracted from the ACES database while others can be extracted from the intermediary s custom questions database . The system can utilize drop downs click boxes text boxes and other entry tools for the seller to add their data. These questions appear in the vehicle details tab below the compatibility data not shown in the figures . The user can answer the additional questions or skip them as they are optional.

The system can also be configured to integrate other third party databases to pull in their questions. For example the system may integrate with the Hollander Interchange System provided by the Solera Company. Their interchange system can be integrated so that when a user lists an item from a vehicle that matches their database their questions can be asked allowing the seller to create very detailed compatibility rich listings. For example the Hollander System may ask the seller to choose which line applies to their 1990 Ford F 150 engine 

As mentioned earlier the questions and answers presented to sellers can assist users in searching particularly by allowing buyers to filter their searches with the answers sellers provided during their listing creation. For example assume Seller A was creating a listing for his door mirror and was presented with three questions 1 Which side are you selling The right The left Both sides 2 Which options if any does this mirror have and 3 What colour is the mirror shows how the answers to these questions can appear in the search filters . In this example a buyer has chosen to filter his search by displaying all Right Passenger Side Light Green Power Mirrors. The brackets beside each filter display the number of items available with that criteria. In there are 75 mirrors that are power two that are light green in colour and 1 from the right passenger side. When buyers filter their search using the search filters the listing results change to display the items that match the filter criteria. is an illustration only and the advanced filters may be presented in an alternate way.

Turning now to the Shipping Payment tab displays information similar to that shown in the selling preferences. It should be noted that in this figure for illustrative purposed only the required details pane is not shown. In this tab sellers can specify how they will ship their item to buyers . As mentioned earlier Canadian and US sellers may choose different shipping methods to buyers in Canada the United States and international buyers . If the seller is not from Canada or the US they would have a fourth option allowing them to specify their shipping method to buyers in their own country. For example if the user is from Australia they can specify a shipping method for shipping within Australia shipping to Canada the United States and shipping internationally. This unique tool allows the seller to be flexible and mix and match their shipping options to different geographic regions. For example the seller in Australia may want to offer free shipping to buyers within Australia offer a flat shipping rate to buyers in the United States use calculated shipping using UPS Fed Ex the United States Postal Service etc. to automatically calculate the shipping price based on the buyer s location and weight and dimensions of the packaged items and finally require that international buyers make individual shipping requests to the seller so that they could determine shipping on a per user basis.

The different shipping methods can include but are not limited to free shipping no shipping calculated shipping flat shipping and contact seller. The seller can choose the appropriate shipping method for each region using the drop down box for that region. For example shows the seller is selecting Shipping Method 3 from the Canada drop down list and has chosen shipping method 2 from the United States drop down list . Once the seller chooses their shipping method the page displays the corresponding required data fields to allow the seller to complete their shipping requirements. For example if the seller chooses Free Shipping they will be able to add up to three shipping services i.e. UPS Ground UPS Next Day Air FedEx Overnight etc. so that the buyer knows how the item will be shipped. If more than one service is added buyers will be able to choose their shipping method when purchasing the item. If the shipping method is Flat Fee as illustrated in for the United States the seller can specify the shipping services and the cost for each service . The seller can also add a different price for situations in which the buyer purchases more than one item. For example shows that the seller specified that shipping the item by UPS 3 Day Select will cost 15.50 for the first item and for each additional item it will cost 12.00. So if the buyer purchases three items shipping will cost 39.50 15.50 12.00 12.00 . Or the buyer could choose UPS Next Day Air and pay 25.50 for the first item and 20.00 for each additional item. If the seller chose calculated shipping not shown they could enter the dimensions of the packaged item choose whether the dimensions use the metric or imperial cm kgs or in lbs measurements and other related information. They could also choose up to three shipping services from a list of participating service providers provided by the administrator . For example UPS and the United States Postal Service may be configured so that the seller could use these services to automatically calculate the shipping price based on the packaged item dimensions and the buyers location.

The last shipping option in this example is Contact Seller. This is a unique shipping option available to sellers that allows them to leave out the shipping price so that they could quickly complete their listing. Buyers interested in their item would use the system s unique messaging tools to request the shipping price for the item. This is especially attractive to sellers who are listing a wide variety of items and do not have a flat shipping price for each item or do not know the dimensions of the packaged item needed for calculated shipping. For example assume User A is selling an engine. Because the engine is so large and requires special shipping and handling it would be very difficult to determine the shipping price to buyers when User A doesn t know where the buyers are located. With the Contact Seller shipping method when buyers view the detailed listing shown in in the Shipping price field buyers would see a Request Shipping Price From Seller link . Clicking this would bring the buyer to a shipping request page where they could request the shipping price from the seller . When a seller receives a shipping request they are shown the buyer s shipping location e.g. city state zip etc. so they can calculate the correct shipping price for that particular buyer . The seller may add up to three shipping services and prices similar to that of flat fee shipping shown in in the United States region . Once the seller responds to the buyer the buyer will have a Buy It button in their message not shown allowing them to purchase the item directly from the message and choose which shipping service they prefer. For example Seller A may respond to a quote and give the buyer two options UPS Overnight Service for 40.00 or UPS Ground for 18.00. The buyer chooses UPS Ground and is then directed to the purchase confirmation page where the shipping price 18 is added to the item price and insurance cost to give the buyer a final total price for the item. The buyer could then complete the transaction or send another shipping request to the seller and ask for a different quote.

If the seller had previously setup their selling preferences all fields that had default values set would be pre filled and the seller would have the opportunity to review them and make any necessary changes they wish to reflect their listing. If the seller does not make any changes to their details the seller could click the Next or Previous buttons to navigate to another tab or click any of the tab names to continue adding optional details to their listing. If the seller makes changes to their existing selling preferences they can click on the Save button not shown to save the preferences for future listings. In this way the user can update their preferences if they notice something that should be updated during a listing and would not have to remember to go back to the main preferences page to do so.

Turning now to which in this example shows the Photos tab. The seller can upload one or more photos at a time using the simple uploader or use the advanced uploader not shown by clicking the Advanced Uploader link . This allows the seller to browse their computer for pictures and video and choose multiple files to upload at the same time. The seller may also use the Damage Designer to mark up the images as will be discussed later by clicking the Use Damage Designer link . When the upload button has been selected the pictures are uploaded to their listing and displayed in the picture review area . Once the files are uploaded the seller can add more pictures remove pictures add a description to a picture and other options. When adding a description to a picture it appears under the picture when being viewed in the photo preview area in detailing listing . To change or remove a description the seller can use the Edit and Remove links under the description. The first picture in the picture review area will be the picture displayed in the photo area of the seller s item listing and displayed in the photo area of the detailed listing shown to buyers illustrated in and displayed as a thumbnail image in the results page . By clicking the Display in Results Page link not shown the seller can make any picture the one to be displayed first. Another option that can be included is an option to allow sellers to upload multiple pictures at the same time and store them under their My Account . For example another tab can be included called Tool Box from which the user is able to do a bulk upload of pictures to access the pictures at a later date. When creating a listing rather than browsing for files in their computer they could move them from their Account to their listing i.e. where no uploading is required. For users that will be listing many items this feature would further speed up the listing process.

It has been found that the incorporation of photos into an item listing can be an important part of the actual listing. It may be noted that the first picture uploaded by the seller can at any time be displayed in a full view in the photo review area when creating a listing to help the user to create that listing. This can be useful since the actual person making the listing is not always the person who took the picture of the item. They may not know the condition of the item or may not remember the brand. The user may also be able to scroll through their pictures from photo review area by using the Next and Previous button not shown .

Once the seller is satisfied with their listing they would click the Preview Finish button to bring the user to the page illustrated in . The system would in this example display a preview that includes all the details and photos for the user to peruse. The seller would then have the opportunity to add special enhancements to their listing for a fee. For example Listing Option A may offer front page exposure while Listing Option B will allow their listing to appear at the top of each results page. The listing options are optional and if the user does not want to add any listing enhancements they could click the No Thanks or Finish button to post the item. If they wish to make any changes to their listing they could click the Go Back button to return to the listing creation page. If the seller wants to add the enhancements they could review the enhancement review the cost and click the check box beside the enhancement of their choice and the listing price would update accordingly. The seller may also be shown a confirmation indicating what the fee will be when the seller sells the item . When the seller is ready to post the item they would click the Finish button to post the item with the enhancements. The charges will be added to their invoice in their account .

Referring again to as noted above a seller can select the List a Multi Item option from the main sell menu. The Multi Item option allows sellers to list their entire item e.g. an entire vehicle through the intermediary in one easy listing without having to enter each and every constituent item that makes up the multi item . The system can also be configured to automatically create individual item listings that resemble single items and that are searchable and appear in the results page for the seller based on the details from their Multi Item . Referring again to the auto parts example it has been recognized that sellers are interested in selling multiple items from a vehicle but do not necessarily have the time or the patience to enter the parts one at a time. Being able to post an entire vehicle in one listing as a multi item is particularly attractive for both simplicity and time savings. In this way the Multi Item option allows the seller to receive part requests from prospective buyers through a request and purchase interface which will be described below.

To illustrate the effectiveness of the Multi Item option an example will now be provided. A seller wants to sell the parts from a 1987 Chrysler New Yorker but does not know if and when they will sell the parts so spending too much time listing parts is unattractive to such a seller . Instead the seller can create one listing for the vehicle using the Multi Item option by accessing the main sell page as shown in and selecting List a Multi Item option which then initiates and displays the interface shown in . The seller in this example can create a vehicle profile and specify the engine size the colour body style 2 Door 4 Door Station Wagon etc power options power manual windows power manual locks and other vehicle details to give potential buyers a good understanding of the seller s vehicle. If the seller wants he can also choose which parts to sell from the vehicle to prevent potential buyers from contacting him about parts that are not available. This will be explained later.

A buyer then upon searching for a hood for a 1987 New Yorker finds that no hood listings are returned through a regular single item search. However since the seller has posted an entire vehicle as a multi item a 1987 Chrysler New Yorker multi item listing is available. The buyer can view the listing and see the detailed profile of the vehicle complete with pictures video a list of the available parts if the seller provided it and other information posted by the seller . A special request form allows the buyer to make part requests to the seller of the New Yorker. The request can be sent to the seller along with the city province state postal zip code of the buyer so the seller can determine the shipping costs for the requested item. The seller then responds to the buyer through a response form. When the buyer receives the response they can purchase the items directly from the response form if they choose. The seller has then sold parts from the multi item without having to individually list any of the parts.

It may be noted that the List a Multi Item option can be a particularly attractive option for entities such as automotive recyclers construction and heavy equipment used parts dealers and the like who have hundreds and many times thousands of vehicles e.g. cars machines tractors transport trucks etc. in their inventory but do not have the time or the desire to list the parts available on these vehicles individually. The Multi Item also does not deviate from the current business processes of the industry.

In the following example there are two stages performed in creating a Multi Item listing namely creating a vehicle profile and choosing the parts that are available for sale. shows the interface for creating a vehicle profile page which is similar to the interface for sell an item shown in with different fields and options provided that are suited to posting a multi item . In the following illustrations features that are similar to those used in the single item listings are given the same reference numeral with the suffix a for clarity.

A required details pane lists details required to complete the multi item listing and an optional details pane allows sellers to add optional details to further describe their listing. The optional details pane is also organized into tabs a Profile tab a Vehicle Details tab a Choose Parts tab a Shipping Payment tab and a Photos Video tab .

The required details pane can be used to begin specifying features and characteristics of the multi item being listed in this example an entire vehicle. Users can immediately begin typing the year and model of their vehicle into the Quick Finder tool explained earlier. The seller can use a number of different query combinations to find their vehicle including but not limited to year and make year and model make and model year and sub model etc. It has been found that users may not know the exact name of a vehicle and therefore the Quick Finder tool is very useful and it searches the categorization database for all vehicles that match the search criteria. For example a seller may want to post their 1987 Suburban but the exact name of the vehicle is actually Chevrolet R10 Suburban. The Quick Finder will find all the 1987 Suburban results and display them to the user. The system can be configured to extract as much or as little detail as deemed necessary by the administrator . For example the quick finder results may display the year make model and sub model that matches the seller s query. In the above Suburban example the sub models for a 1987 Suburban can be Custom Deluxe Scottsdale and Silverado which represent different vehicle options and packages thereby making them different. Another query may include the engine size etc. illustrates the seller typing Acc in the quick finder and choosing Honda Accord from the results list .

Turning now to once the seller selects the vehicle they are creating the listing for from the quick finder either by using the arrow keys or by other input method the chosen vehicle is shown to the seller by displaying their choice in the vehicle click boxes . This helps the user identify what they have chosen. Note that because the make and model of the vehicle were displayed in the results list the make click box and model click box are pre filled to match the selected make and model from the results list . Since the year and model was not entered into the quick finder the system does not know what they are. The seller could therefore choose the year and sub model from the year and sub model click boxes.

Similar to the single listing process described above if the Quick Finder cannot match the seller s entry to the main category database the seller can click the Browse Vehicles link shown in to display the click boxes and allows the users to browse through all the vehicles listed in the categorization database . The user can also click the Can t find your vehicle link also shown in which loads the custom vehicle entry tool explained earlier in the single listing process and shown in and . In these examples the Make Model Year and Sub Model fields are displayed individually. The user can begin to type the first detail e.g. Make and a results list appears to enable the selection of the appropriate details using drop down lists and auto fill features similar to those described above. According to the characters entered in the Make field a make filtered list is generated. Once the user chooses a make from the list the cursor focus changes to the model field with the same auto fill functionality as the make field but displays the models associated with the selected make. shows the sequential work flow of a seller entering data into the fields. The List an Item process described earlier explains this in greater detail. The system can be configured to add more or fewer auto fill boxes. In the event that the auto fill does not match anything in the categorization database as shown in the model field in the user can continue typing their custom vehicle. Notice that no auto fill result was available. The system administrator can then store this data and choose to add it to the categorization database as described earlier.

Next the seller may be prompted to create a headline for their listing by completing a headline field as shown in . An example of a headline is 1998 Ford F150 Pick Up Runs Great Box Damaged . The seller can then indicate the general or overall condition of the vehicle by choosing a condition from the condition drop down box . The system may be configured to create the headline for the seller . If the seller wants the system to generate the headline they may click the Generate Auto Headline link. The system can then generate a headline based on the vehicle condition and other details added by the seller . This is convenient if the seller is not sure what to include in their headline.

The seller can specify if they are willing to sell their multi item in this example a vehicle as a complete unit to a buyer by specifying purchase conditions in the required items pane . It has been recognized that often buyers that have the intention of buying one or two parts from a vehicle may end up purchasing the complete unit to have access to other parts at a later time. For example the seller may specify a price of 500 to sell the complete unit as shown in . The purchase conditions in this example are controlled by two radio buttons and . By selecting the second radio button buyers can purchase the complete vehicle and the seller may then enter a price in the price field indicating the cost of purchasing the entire vehicle. By selecting the first radio button which is also by default selected buyers cannot purchase complete vehicle.

Using the radio buttons the seller makes their choice. Indexed with the second radio button is the price field as shown in . The price field can be controlled such that it remains hidden until the seller chooses the second radio button . Once the second radio button is chosen the seller is then prompted to enter a price for their vehicle in the price field . If the seller later changes their decision by selecting the first radio button the price field clears and becomes hidden and thus unavailable as shown in .

When the second radio button is selected the seller is also able to enter their cost of the vehicle being listed by entering a value in a cost field as shown in . The cost field has been found to be particularly useful for a seller s reporting purposes. For example the system can be configured such that if a seller specifies the cost of the vehicle the profit is automatically calculated according to the difference between the cost of the vehicle and the sales resulting from it e.g. the net selling price not including the shipping price . Each time the seller makes a sale from the multi item a profitability report may then be recalculated. In various embodiments to protect privacy only the seller should be able to access the profit and cost data when viewing the listing and response fauns or when viewing the multi item through their account as will be discussed later.

Similar to a single listing the seller is then prompted to complete a description field as shown in . This enables a seller to enter a detailed description of the vehicle being listed e.g. the seller can specify details such as The vehicle is in good shape except for the box. It s damaged and rusted over the wheel wells. The engine has 200 000 km but still runs great. This provides more information to the buyer . The user can then select the method of payment they accept from buyers from the payment method click boxes . If the user has preset their selling preferences in particular their preferred methods of payment the appropriate click boxes would automatically be selected. If not the user would be required to choose at least one accepted method of payment.

The Save Preview Finish and Cancel buttons work the same as the single item listing process described earlier. As well the photo picture area can display pictures that have been uploaded to that listing to assist the seller in completing the multi item profile.

Turning now to the Profile tab in the optional details pane shown in . In this illustration the user can add the vehicle s VIN full or partial VIN number by completing a VIN field which may be useful to buyers since the VIN number provides detailed information about the vehicle. For security purposes the system can be configured to warn sellers not to enter the last 6 digits of the VIN as this may comprise the vehicle s unique identifier. This may be done to inhibit malicious activity such as recreating a VIN number on a stolen vehicle. The seller can also enter SKU or inventory numbers in the inventory fields to keep track of vehicles and or items being sold in particular when sold by a business. When a part is requested the SKU number can be included on the request faith so that the seller can quickly identify which vehicle the request is for. Other details can be added into Item Detail C fields and private notes as described earlier can be added into the private notes field .

The seller can also specify the damage condition of the multi item by choosing from a variety of conditions from the list of indicators to give a quick general overview of the damage condition of the vehicle. For example the seller can specify Collision Damage Roll Over Fire Damage Water Damage Rusted Vandalized Front End Damage Driver Side Damage Rear Damage No Damage etc from the damage condition click boxes . This makes it easy for buyers to limit their searches to these conditions when searching for a multi item . For example one buyer may not be interested in a multi item in this example a vehicle that has front end damage. Such a buyer would therefore filter out Front End Damage from their search. The photo preview area in the required items pane pane is particularly useful for reminding the seller of what the condition may be at least visually which can be helpful when listing many multi items .

Turning now to the Vehicle Details tab shown in which similar to the single item listing allows the seller to enter other specific details to more completely describe their multi item . As well the details here will be made visible to buyers as will be described later. The vehicle details tab displays information in two panes The Vehicle Information Pane and the Features Options pane . The vehicle information pane allows the seller to enter specific details about the vehicle specified in the Profile tab utilizing in this example drop down and text boxes. It also uses the ACES intermediary and questions databases to gather the details. For example if Seller A chose a 2008 Honda Accord in the Profile tab the body style drop down box in the vehicle information pane may display 2 Door Coupe and 4 Door Sedan as the choices derived from the ACES database . The seller can choose which body style detail pertains to their 2008 Accord. If the ACES database does not have the details answers can be derived from the intermediary database . For example if a seller from the United Kingdom was creating a listing for their vehicle the ACES database would likely not have the details since it is a European vehicle. In this case the intermediary database can provide the details in the drop down box. The questions database can also be used for more general details for example the colour. The questions database can produce a list of colours in the drop down boxes to allow the seller to quickly choose a colour from the list. In cases where neither the ACES the Intermediary nor the questions databases can provide details the system will change the drop down boxes into text boxes to allow the seller to manually enter their information. As this is optional information the seller can choose not to enter any details.

Details that may be listed in the vehicle information pane include but are not limited to Trim Package Body Style Engine Size Transmission Drive Train Fuel Type Mileage Exterior Color Exterior Paint Code Interior Color Interior Trim Code and Production Date. It should be noted that the vehicle specific details described above are for illustrative purposes only and various other features details and information can be requested depending on the configuration of the system . Use of the interfaces described herein may also minimize the number of repeat questions and requests from buyers for parts not specific to the vehicle that is actually listed. For example if the seller does not specify they have a 2 Door car they may receive continuous requests for parts specific to 4 Door cars such as the rear door.

If the seller has not chosen a vehicle from the Profile tab the Vehicle Information pane can be configured to be disabled with a notification instructing the user that they must first choose a vehicle before adding specific details about it.

The Features Options pane is further organized into tabs Exterior Interior and Engine Other. Each tab displays features and options related to each other. For example the Exterior tab displays vehicle features and options that pertain to the exterior of the vehicle. The seller would not be required to choose any of these options or answer any of the questions presented to the seller however the seller can be encouraged to take the time to do so to refine their listing and make it more attractive to buyers . and display examples of the type of details presented to the seller for each of the tabs . It should be noted that these are illustrations only and more or less details may included. The system may also provide a text box to allow the seller to add their own custom details in the event that the seller wants to include more details.

When sellers choose these options they are displayed to buyers in the multi item detailed listing shown in . The details from the Vehicle Information pane are displayed in the Vehicle Summary of the multi item detailed listing . The details from the Features Options tabs are displayed in the Vehicle Features Options section of the multi item detailed listing . This allows the buyers to quickly view what features and options the multi item has.

All details listed by the seller should be searchable and filterable. For example if a buyer wants to find a multi item with specific options such as red exterior colour leather seats power windows automatic transmission front wheel drive 4 door etc. they could use the advanced search filters to find them. The system then searches through the details provided by the seller to find a match.

Question mark hints can be provided to assist sellers in the event that they do not understand a question and or feature or option. For example a seller could click on the question mark beside the Windshield Options to show a picture of the difference between privacy glass and tinted glass. The use and function of the Question is described later herein.

It should be noted that the vehicle specific details described above are for illustrative purposes only and various other features details and information can be requested depending on the nature of the multi item being sold.

Once the seller is satisfied with their level of detail they could use the next button or click on the Choose Parts tab to proceed to the choose parts stage shown in . If they decide to finish the listing later their partial listing can be saved by clicking the save button so they can continue at a later date. It may be noted that a partial listing would not be available for other users to see as it is not yet listed. The choose parts tab can be configured by the system to be disabled if the seller has not chosen a vehicle from the Profile tab.

The choosing parts tab allows the seller to choose which parts they do and do not want to sell for whatever reason. As shown in the different areas of the vehicle can be broken down into tabs along the top of a parts selection portion allowing the seller to address different sections of the vehicle at different times for convenience to the seller . This also enables the seller to target specific sections in particular if only certain sections of the vehicle are saleable. For example if the vehicle has no useable parts except for the interior and driveline the seller may simply click on the Interior and Engine Driveline tabs to display the parts associated with the respective area of the vehicle and disregard the rest. The different sections of the vehicle will hereinafter be referred to as Groups . The groups shown by way of example in comprise without limitation Exterior Body Engine Driveline Suspension Steering Brakes ABS Interior and Custom user defined .

When the Choose Parts tab is loaded the first group Exterior Body in this example is shown by default and the corresponding tab highlighted as shown in . Each group contains smaller sections called sub groups to make it easy for the seller to select the parts. In this example each sub group contains a list of common parts with click boxes beside each which can be conveniently displayed in a tree structure as shown in . The seller can quickly skim through the different parts and select which ones they want to sell from the vehicle being listed.

As can also be seen in photo previews can be provided to again assist the seller in remembering which parts are available which vehicle is being listed etc. Also a Select All box can be provided to allow the seller to select all of the parts within the sub group and to deselect this option. If the seller wishes to select every part on their vehicle without navigating through the different sub groups they could choose the Select All Parts on Vehicle box located in the top right corner of the choose parts portion . It can be appreciated that various mechanisms can be used to allow the seller to select and deselect parts groups or even every available part to provide a representation of what is available for sale. To view the sub groups the seller can select the link in the tree structure which reveals a list of parts e.g. descriptors linked directly to the main category database . For example the seller may expand the Front End sub group to reveal a sub tree of parts which in this example includes parts descriptors such as door fender grille header panel and hood all of which are parts from the front end of their vehicle. An example of this is shown in .

It may be noted that some parts descriptors will have different positions or details attached to them such as front rear left or right. For example the descriptor Fender may have a position attached to it. In this way when a seller chooses Fender from the sub tree they can specify which side of the vehicle the item is from the left or the right. Vehicles have or should have a left and right fender and a left and right headlight however one may be good while the other may be damaged. As such the positions can be pulled from the ACES intermediary and or questions databases linked to a particular descriptor. By default if the part type descriptor such as fender is selected all positions can be pre selected for simplicity allowing the seller to deselect which ever item they are not selling i.e. opt out for that item. Examples of the use of the positions are shown in .

The system can also be configured such that the positions also take into account details entered in the vehicle details tab . For example if the seller specifies their vehicle is a 2 Door then when they are provided with the opportunity to select the door positions only the options left and right would appear whereas if they specified their vehicle to be a 4 Door the available positions would reflect this difference by displaying four options namely left front right front left rear and right rear.

Some descriptors that have multiple positions have the position inherent in the sub group they belong to. For example the category Bumper is listed in the both sub groups Front End and Rear Body . Under Front End there is only one front bumper so the need for the seller to specify that it is a front bumper is redundant. As such in these cases the position is selected by default automatically without requiring input from the seller . In the above example when the seller views the sub group Rear Body the bumper position would only show Rear since there is only one possible position for a bumper in the rear and this would be automatically selected.

It may also be noted that another benefit of using the main category database is that the system may refine the descriptor tree list based on the vehicle year make and model chosen. For example if a seller was creating a multi item listing for a 1957 Chevrolet car the main category database can ascertain that some parts descriptors were not available for that vehicle in that year e.g. air bags were not available.

Once the seller has finished selecting their parts the total number of parts they are listing can be tallied and may appear in brackets beside the group names not shown . For example Front End 45 Rear Body 1 Engine Mechanical All 75 Steering Suspension All 80 Interior 3 conveniently indicates how many parts are available in each group. In the example above there are 45 front end parts for sale and only 1 rear body part for sale. For sections where the seller has selected all of the parts an All indicator can be provided with the number assigned to the group to indicate that the seller has selected all the parts for sale. This makes it easy for the seller to conveniently recall when they have included every part from their parts vehicle. If All is not in the brackets this would imply that the seller is not selling some parts from their vehicle at least in that particular group.

Turning now to the seller can be provided with additional information by incorporating additional information into the database . In this example by selecting highlighting or clicking on the part name a dialogue box is launched alongside the particular part name and provides a description of the item and a picture of the part if available. In this way if the seller does not know the name of an item or does not know what an item is the dialogue box can be a quick and convenient way to familiarize the seller with what the part looks and what it is for. For example if Seller A does not know what a Fuse Box is Seller A can select the word Fuse Box from the parts list whereby a picture of a generic Fuse Box is displayed in a dialogue box with a short description of what it does.

The common list of parts displayed in each group should depend on the vehicle the seller is listing. For example trucks have parts that cars do not have and vice versa. For instance trucks have a pick up box and a cab whereas cars typically do not. Cars have a trunk or a hatch whereas trucks usually do not. The admin tool can be used to allow the selection of which parts are considered common and for what type of vehicle. For example vehicles can be categorized into the following types cars trucks vans SUV and station wagons. Of course the admin tool should be capable of handling anomalies. For example an El Camino is a two door car with a truck like box in the rear. If a seller were to create a multi item listing for their El Camino they would typically not see Car Box in the parts list. However in this scenario the seller may enter additional parts in the Other Parts field .

Turning now to use of the custom tab is exemplified. In this example the custom tab is used to display parts that a seller has added themselves. A separate entry box can also be provided to allow sellers to add parts to their custom tab through the Parts Car Preferences not shown in My Account . This can be particularly useful in the event that the system is missing a particular part or category.

The seller can then add their shipping and payment options similar to those in the single item listing process described above. One main difference is that the seller cannot use the calculated shipping or flat fee shipping option since they do not know what they are selling until a buyer requests an item. They could choose No Shipping and Contact Seller since they cannot provide details as to the cost of the parts. Furthermore the seller can add pictures and or video to their multi item listing as described in the single item listing process. illustrate the Shipping Payment and Photos Video tabs respectively. The number of photos a seller can upload free of charge can be controlled by enforcing limits according to a seller type .

Once the seller is satisfied with their multi item listing they can click the Preview Finish button to bring the seller to the preview page as described in the single item listing process. The multi item listing may offer the same listing enhancements or enhancements specifically for multi item listings. The page will resemble .

For buyers finding an individual item e.g. part from a multi item e.g. vehicle can be performed in a manner similar to finding individual items . When a buyer searches for an item the system can be configured to display all individual listings along with a list of multi items that may have the parts the buyer is looking for. Turning now to a search results page is shown which in this example is separated into three tabs or portions namely an all items list an items list and a multi items list referred to as Parts Vehicles in . As can be seen in separate panes can be provided for advanced search filters for performing advanced searching options as is known in the art.

It has been found that displaying a certain number of items followed by the multi items that have that item in the items list enables the system to generate a comprehensive list for the buyer . For example the page can be configured to display 15 items with the any multi items listed below up to a maximum of 6 multi items to minimize scrolling. If there are more items and multi items found in the search a See More link not shown can be displayed indicating to the buyer that more choices are available. Selecting such a link would then refresh the page to only display the multi items or can simply provide further scrolling capabilities. The multi items list can be provided in a separate tab to allow users to focus a search for just multi items . For example if the buyer only wishes to view the multi items they may select the tab for the multi items list to change views in the page . If at a later time the buyer wishes to display individual items they can select the items tab named Parts Accessories in . It should be noted that the page can be expanded to include additional tabs.

In the example shown in each item or multi item listed in the search page shows a thumbnail picture or other multi media link such as video typically the first picture of the item or multi item that was uploaded by the seller with other details such as the year make and model specified in the listing created by the seller . For multi items the groups in the multi item that contain individual items can also be shown with the number of items available in each group shown with an identifier for the group in parentheses not shown e.g. Exterior 6 Engine 48 etc. This can provide the buyer with a quick glimpse of the number and type of items available for that multi item which facilitates quick browsing and more user friendly searching for the buyer .

It has also been found that for some multi items similar models or other multi items that share common items can also be provided to the buyer . Returning to the vehicle parts example if a buyer searches for a Chrysler New Yorker a Chrysler Dynasty may also appear with following a list of all available New Yorkers since the Dynasty is a similar model that uses many of the same parts as the New Yorker. The main category database can thus be further configured to indicate relationships between multi items and the admin tool can be configured to modify and update such relationships. Also the advanced search pane can provide the buyer with tools to modify their search e.g. whether or not to show similar models.

The system can also be configured such that a search uncovers similar vehicles multi items within a window of time e.g. 5 year span on each side of the specified year . For example if a buyer searches for a 2005 Ford Focus vehicles from 2000 2010 can be displayed. However this window can be modified through the advanced search pane .

As discussed above in the choosing parts tab of the listing process the seller chooses which parts are available and which are not. This makes it very convenient for a buyer when searching for parts using the category descriptor auto fill tools also described above which uses the auto fill tool . In this way the system can match the multi item and then perform a check to see if the seller indicated that they have the specific items available. If so the multi item can be selected to appear in the results page .

In the vehicle parts example consider a case where Seller A lists a 2000 Dodge Neon as a multi item and in doing so lists the left driver side fender as being available and omitted the right side since it was damaged. After some time elapses a buyer enters the keyword string right fender neon into the main search entry box . Seller A s multi item listing may appear in the results page since keyword matches for fender and neon were successful. However if the buyer instead uses the advanced search pane and selects the right fender from descriptor auto fill tool or otherwise specified such a part the search tool can use the database to perform a filtered query and determine that Seller A is not selling the right fender on the Neon being listed and as such the vehicle would not be included in the results.

The system can be configured such that parts that are not selected by the seller in the Choose Parts tab representing those parts that the seller chooses not to sell when listing the multi item are not searchable within the system . For example if Seller A does not select hood and fender from the Choose Parts tab for a listing of a 1995 Ford Probe a buyer searching for a hood or fender for a 1995 Probe would not find Seller A s listing since Seller A has indicated that his hood and fender is not for sale.

Turning now to a multi item listing page is shown which is initiated and displayed upon sensing the selection of a multi item from the search results page . The listing page provides the details of the selected multi item that were specified by the seller e.g. as described and exemplified above. The layout of the listing page for a multi item is in this example similar to the layout of a listing for an item e.g. as shown in . The buyer can browse through the vehicle details view the seller s shipping details view the payment return policy view the vehicle s multi media such as pictures and video view the history etc. using listing navigation tabs . Specifically the history tab contains all questions and part requests that the seller chooses to make public testimonials from other users as well as listings of the parts the seller indicated as available from the choose parts tab allowing buyers to avoid sending requests for items that the seller isn t selling or that have already been sold. For example a buyer is going to make a part request for a headlight but upon looking at the history tab the buyer sees that the item is marked sold. Buyers could browse the parts with an interface similar to the choose parts tree view in the choose parts tab .

From the detailed listing page shown in the buyer is able to send the seller an item part request by selecting a Request a Part button . The purpose of the request is to ask the seller if their vehicle multi item has the parts items the buyer is looking for how much it costs and how much shipping would be etc. If the seller has chosen to sell the complete vehicle at once a Purchase Vehicle button can be provided to the buyer . When a buyer clicks the Buy Vehicle button a purchase process would then continue similar to that for purchasing a single part. If the buyer has any questions or concerns regarding the listing the buyer can select an Ask the Seller a Question button or click the Contact Seller tab and post a question to the seller not shown .

Upon selecting the Request a Part button a Buyer Request page such as that shown in is displayed. The Request page comprises a request list auto fill fill form which enables the user to begin typing the name of the part item that they are interested in a first field which may utilize the auto fill tool to display an auto fill result list to assist in selecting the desired part or item . The form also comprises a second field for entering comments pertaining to the part or item being requested. A third field is also provided to enable the buyer to upload a photo or video related to the request. An Other Comments field is provided for other general comments requests etc. and a Send Request button is used to submit the request to the seller . The Request page also provides a shipping address portion which can be configured to load the buyer s shipping address as saved in their profile or alternatively allow them to specify a different address by selecting a Change My Shipping Address link . A shipping preferences box can also be provided to allow the buyer to specify their preferred shipping method s . If the buyer wants to add more items than the form provides they may click the request more items link not shown to provide the buyer with more rows in the form.

It has been found that immediately placing focus of the cursor or input mechanism to the first field upon loading the Request page is particularly advantageous as it allows the buyer to immediately begin typing what they are looking for which then loads the auto fill results as discussed above. In this way where many requests are filled out by a buyer time savings can be realized. If the item the buyer is looking for is not in the auto fill list the buyer may continue typing characters identifying the desired item . They buyer may choose a category and sub category to give the seller at least some identifying information about the desired item . For example if a buyer requests a buster the seller may not know what the buyer is looking for if there is no such part called a buster. However if the buyer instead specifies the item to be listed under the Brakes ABS Brake Boosters the seller may be more likely to interpret the buster as a brake booster . This helps both the buyer and seller . In another embodiment if the item the buyer is looking for is not in the auto fill list the buyer may type the characters identifying the desired item and their input is accepted by the system . This entry is also sent to the administrator for review. If the entry is approved by the administrator then the item is added to the main database and appears when the auto fill tool is used. For example if a buyer enters a request for an ebm box although this entry is not a descriptor in the main database the system accepts the entry and the request is sent to the seller . If the seller does not know what the buyer is asking for they can contact the buyer directly. The buyer s entry is also sent to the administrator to determine whether the new entry should be added to the main database .

It may be noted that depending on which part item the buyer has specified the system can be configured to provide one or more suggested questions for the buyer to answer as shown in as will be explained in greater detail below. Such questions can be similar to the questions asked when listing a new item and are intended to help the buyer give important details they may have forgotten. For example in the example in the buyer can be prompted to specify if the headlights are Sealed Beam or Composite as they are two completely different lights. If the buyer does not know what the questions means they may then be provided with the option of selecting a question to load a help window similar to that explained above which provides helpful information along with a sample image or video if available. It will be appreciated that providing and answering such additional questions should not be required but can be encouraged to provide the seller with as much information about the buyer s desired item as possible and to minimize the risk of the seller quoting on the wrong parts in their response. As also explained earlier the questions database can integrate with third party databases to offer more questions.

The second field can then be used to fill in comments associated with the item in the correspondent first field to give more details about the request. In the example in above it can be seen that the buyer indicates that they require both the left and right fenders and headlights and specifies that the engine must be a 5.4 L. The other comments field at the bottom of the page allows the buyer to give additional non part specific details such as The parts must be in near perfect condition or Do you ship to Hawaii etc.

The admin tool can be configured to monitor the buyer s requests to inhibit the use of the system to set up an offline sale. For example the admin tool can determine if phone numbers email addresses or other information is being provided in the request that could enable the sale to be made outside of the system . In this way the system can maintain control over the transactions to properly reward loyal account holders that support the system . Similarly the system can be configured such that the buyer can browse the webpage prior to registering but then require registration before sending a parts request or before sending a request to a seller s user account. The third field allows the buyer to upload video or photos for the seller and link such multimedia to each individual parts request. For example in the buyer could upload a picture of the fender they have to show the seller the type of trim desired. This can be particularly useful for the hard to explain parts or the parts the buyer finds difficult in naming or explaining. A multimedia file can be uploaded by selecting the corresponding third field which loads the upload tool and described above.

The shipping address portion displays the buyer s shipping address and shows the buyer what the seller will see regarding a requested shipping location. The seller can use this address to calculate shipping costs. The buyer can also specify their shipping preferences so that the seller knows which freight company to quote with if more than one can be used.

Once the buyer has finished filling in their request page and wishes to send the request they may select the Send Request button . Before the buyer can send their request they can be prompted with a terms and conditions agreement of using the service not shown to be read and accepted.

Once the request is successfully processed the seller can be emailed a message not shown notifying them that they have received a parts request. It will be appreciated that the message can instead be posted to the seller s account both emailed and posted or any other form of communication such that the seller is notified. The message can be structured to indicate various data regarding the request such as the year make and model of the multi item the seller s private fields SKU Stock number the buyer s user ID etc. When the message is sent outside of the system a link can also be provided to direct the seller to their account where they can access the actual request.

The request can be provided to the seller along with the ability to respond to the request directly to further the transaction. Turning now to a request response page is shown. A first portion of the page can be used to show important information including that information private to the seller which was entered during the listing process. This information may include without limitation SKU Stock number year make and model. The buyer s shipping location city province state country and postal zip code is also shown in a shipping portion along with the buyer s user ID shipping preferences and general comments below. It may be noted that to avoid bypassing the system as discussed above the system can obfuscate the street address while still providing the city postal or zip code province state and country to allow the seller to at least estimate shipping costs. The system can then provide the buyer s full contact information to the seller once the transaction is complete. The shipping details or procedure is determined solely by the seller .

The response portion comprises a reply list providing the individual items that have been requested and the ability to respond to each individual request. It can be seen that copies of the information provided by the buyer may be included such as those referenced by similar numerals with a prime for clarity. An availability selector portion is also provided which allows the seller to quickly specify whether the item is available or not by using radio buttons click boxes or similar selection mechanisms. It may be noted that completion of the availability portion may be made mandatory to ensure that the response at least notifies the buyer of the availability.

A price field is also provided to enable the seller to specify the desired selling price of the item excluding shipping costs in this example . This may also be considered a mandatory field since the buyer is almost certainly interested in the price of the item . A shipping cost field is also provided which may be optional in particular where it is difficult to estimate the cost due to weight duties and other auxiliary costs. The seller can be prompted with reminders such as to remind them that the price field is only related to the particular line item and not the entire request. The seller can if desired specify the shipping price of the item by using the stripped down version of the address and if the seller does not add a shipping price in the field then the buyer would see an indicator such as Not Specified in the shipping field when viewing the response. A response comments field can also be provided to allow the seller to add comments or other details about the item . To provide further information and for the benefit of the buyer the seller may also choose to select an upload field to upload photos or video of the item which loads the upload tool or as explained earlier. This allows the buyer to see the item before they agree to purchase the item .

The response portion can also include a selection mechanism to allow the seller to indicate whether or not to include the response in the history tab in the listing page . Including the history of the responses can be useful not only for the seller to minimize the number duplicate questions and requests but also to provide the buyer with more time saving information. For example the seller in has selected Yes in the history selection mechanism to make their response public. If at a later time another buyer looking for the headlights views the multi item listing and views the history tab they would determine that a previous buyer has already requested the headlights and the seller indicated they were damaged. The buyer may then decide not to include the headlights with their request.

The seller may also enter other details information comments etc. in a general comments box provided in the response portion . Once the seller has completed the response portion the response can be submitted by selecting a Send Response button . Once the seller sends their response the buyer receives an email or other notification e.g. text message indicating they have received a response from the seller . The message can include information pertaining to the request to identify the response as such for example the year make and model of the vehicle the seller s user ID etc. A link can be included in the email that when selected takes the buyer directly to the response in their user account .

A response page as seen by the buyer is shown in . It can be seen that the response page includes the listing details with the response details below. The seller s comments are provided to alert the buyer to any particular information that could be pertinent or general comments that may affect their decision to go ahead with the transaction. Similar to the original request the buyer can edit their shipping information however this may affect the pricing given below. The items that are available are listed in an available parts section and the items that are not available are listed in the unavailable parts section which is a portion of the list generated by the buyer in the request. The price and shipping costs if specified by the seller are shown along with the seller s comments . The system can provide a mechanism to instantly proceed with a purchase by providing next to each individual item that is available a Buy It button that allows the buyer to purchase the item directly from the response page . To enable the buyer to quickly accept all items a total price can be listed below the items which represents the cost to buy all of the available parts. A Buy All button may then be selected to accept the price for all items . In another embodiment the buyer can select check boxes not shown to select only the items they want to purchase and the total price displayed represents the cost for only the selected items. When the buyer then selects the Buy All button they can purchase the items they selected from the list .

Selecting the Buy All button can cause the system to take the buyer through the normal purchase process except that the buyer would confirm the purchases of all the items listed in the available parts section at the same time on one page. For example in the fenders cost 170 120 50 and the engine costs 775 650 125 . When the buyer selects the Buy All button a purchase confirmation page not shown would list all of the items and display for the buyer the total price. The buyer may then be prompted to confirm that they agree to pay 945 for the fenders and engine including shipping.

As can be seen in below the available parts section is a collection of the pictures or videos the seller uploaded in thumbnail size when completing the request. To assist the user in identifying the multimedia in the collection a short description can be provided with each multimedia thumbnail to describe the picture or video. To view the full size picture or to start the video the buyer can select the desired image or video. If the seller uploaded video the word Video can be displayed under the thumbnail image to distinguish video from pictures.

The items that are not available are shown in an unavailable items section in this example below the collection of multimedia thumbnails. An Ask Another Question entry box can also be provided in the response page to allow the buyer to respond to the response by asking a further question or questions. If the buyer does ask additional questions and sends the message to the seller the seller can be given the opportunity to modify all of the previous entries as their previous entries have been saved in the system . For example if the buyer responds by saying The price is too high. I will purchase it for 20 less the price the seller originally sent is displayed so the seller can easily see what they previously sent. This is very useful since the seller may receive many messages from different buyers making it difficult for the seller to remember what they quoted to each buyer . The seller can then change their price directly in the response page and send it back to the buyer . The buyer can continue negotiating or make the purchase.

When a buyer purchases an item such purchased item is no longer available and thus should be removed from the available parts list . For example if the seller specified that the engine is available and a buyer purchases it from a parts response page the engine thereafter appears as sold an would no longer be searchable. If an item is sold the history tab s contents can be updated to reflect the sale. For example if the seller in sold the fenders i.e. in this example the buyer has selected the Buy It button from the response page and confirmed the purchase upon selecting the history tab this information would be reflected.

It can be appreciated from the above described process pertaining to listing searching and buying multi items that the multi item process is a quick and convenient way to list an entire multi item such as a vehicle without having to list each item individually or decide upon a price. The seller is not prompted to specify a price or enter a description for each item they choose in the choosing the parts stage they simply choose which items they want to be searched or not searched.

By selecting the history tab when viewing a listing all of the questions and parts requests the seller has chosen to include in the history tab is provided to potential buyers as exemplified in . The history tab can be selected to enable buyers to keep track of requests and purchases and questions pertaining to the vehicle. Buyers can browse through the questions and corresponding answers as well as browse through the list of available parts using the same tree structure interface as sellers use when choosing their parts etc. From the tree structure shown in the buyer can quickly and conveniently select parts that are currently available and select a Request Parts button to set up a new request.

An example of the contents displayed when selecting the Photos Video tab is shown in . In this example a collection of the pictures and videos that the seller has uploaded can be viewed. Also in this way the system can keep track of pictures videos for that particular multi item so that the seller does not have to upload these multiple times. Below each picture or video in the collection is a brief description which may be added by the seller to describe the respective photo or video.

Requests and responses for all items both from single item listings and multi item listings can be organized and tracked in both the buyer s and seller s account as shown in . shows one illustration of the mailbox that handles all of the messaging. The user could filter their messages to display all part requests for sellers or all part responses for buyers . Selecting anything listed in the mailbox would take the user into the detailed request or response not shown .

As discussed above the intermediary may comprise or have access to the store website database to provide a web domain or store front for a seller . The store front can be created for a user when they become a seller . The store front enables all of the seller s items that have been listed in the items database to be housed in one centrally accessible and organized place that may be considered a virtual store for that seller . By providing an individualized web domain or store front for the seller the seller has their own space within the system to enable them to connect with other sellers buyers and to promote their store or business if applicable. Once a user becomes a seller the system can be configured to provide a website address that is associated with the seller s user id. In this way the seller can provide a link between their identity personal or corporate with the system . For example Company X having a user id compX may be given a store address of http compX.intermediary.com . Any number of addressing schemes can be used and the choice of which to use may be dependent on an existing addressing structure for the system or any other application specific parameter. For example the address may be compX.intermediary.com as exemplified above or stores.intermediary.com compX . This can be considerably convenient for buyers to search through the seller s inventory and can be provided as a free value add feature for sellers . By providing a web address for each store entering a store s web address then directs the user to the seller s store an example of which is shown in .

When a user registers as a seller the system can provide an option for the newly registered seller to open a store through their account and allows the seller to build and promote their store by selecting the Build Your Store option from the main selling menu page shown in to initiate a process to build their store not shown advertise their products in optimal places build a brand image etc. The process can be implemented using a separate page with entry boxes etc. a set up wizard or any other suitable mechanism for obtaining information graphics video etc. The system can be configured to provide promotional capabilities at an extra cost to the seller or through a premium or upgrade membership to obtain further revenue. Promoting their business allows the seller to associate a corporate logo a business profile include video of their physical store or warehouse integrate parts catalogues and more. Essentially what the seller can do is plug in their existing website or business into the intermediary to create a virtual extension of their business and website. For example Company X has an existing website in which they sell auto parts. Company X wants to reach new markets and grow their business so they setup their store on the intermediary . This can be compared to Company X opening another bricks and mortar store in a shopping mall. The intermediary in this example would be the shopping mall that houses sellers stores through the network . Company X s store on the system may be connected to its website and or business using an API XML or other technology. The intermediary stores sellers data on the system and may organize it based on the categorization database e.g. descriptors categories sub categories etc. . Users can then access all of the search tools available on the system to find items in seller s stores.

When setting up their store the seller can setup detailed store profiles indicating details such as but not limited to what they specialize in makes of vehicles they deal with years in business location postal zip code awards company profile etc. Once sellers open and setup their store their store becomes listed in the store tab for buyers to see. Advanced search tools allow buyers to perform detailed queries. For example Buyer A may want to find a store that specializes in selling body parts for their old 1957 car while another buyer may want to find a store that specializes in transmission parts for their late model BMW. Once buyers find the store they can browse through the store s item catalogues contact the store purchase items etc. Buyers may also be redirected to the seller s own store not through the intermediary if the seller subscribed to the Product Advertising feature discussed later.

The intermediary also localizes the data matching buyers and sellers in the same town city etc. For example the seller Company X is based in Thunder Bay. Buyer s in Thunder Bay may be presented with Company X s store to search for items check their inventory stock etc. because they are within close proximity to each other. The buyers can then purchase Company X s items through the intermediary or go to Company X s bricks and mortar physical store to make their purchase.

The store feature is also used with service sellers that is sellers that can provide services related to the categorization database . For example Seller A specializes in manufacturing custom vehicle seats and custom vehicle rims. Buyer A browses stores on the system to find sellers that can manufacturer the rims they are looking for. The buyer finds Seller A on the system and arranges their services to create the custom rims to fit their car. The entire process from contacting the seller ordering the service paying for the service etc. can be completed through the system not shown .

It can be seen that the store front can be arranged similar to the other features exemplified above i.e. with the main navigation pane along the top and the store front page underneath. For the store front page only the seller s items are displayed. The system can be configured to automatically pull in all of the seller s existing listings from the items database and indicate the existing of these listings in the seller s store front page . The system can also organize the listings based on the categories and sub categories described above and may utilize menus and separate panes for convenience.

The store front page can be arranged in any suitable manner to provide an organized interface for displaying the seller s listings to potential buyers . In the example shown in a promotional area is provided which can be dedicated to the seller s business brand image etc. The seller s user id can also be associated with or included in the promotional area . A side menu of features can also be provided. For example a search tool can be provided which is configured to search only within the seller s store group of listings and or seller s item catalogues rather than the entire items database . A category tree can also be provided which can be configured by the system to automatically pull in and organize the listings into categories and sub categories e.g. driveline axles 4 WD actuator shown in . Adjacent to each category name can be a number in parentheses representing the number of items in that category that the seller has listed or available in their catalogue. The system can be configured to recognize empty categories and remove category names that do not have any current listings. The system can also be configured to display the seller s items catalogue in the store page to make it seem as if the buyer went directly to the seller s website not through the intermediary not shown . For example the store page may look identical to the seller s website however the buyer would be viewing the seller s store through the intermediary .

Similar to the tree structures described above upon selection of the category name a sub category can be displayed with the number of parts available within that sub category. The tree structure can be configured to limit the granularity to accommodate display constraints if desired. Upon selection of a category listing or by performing a search a results list can be generated and displayed for the buyer in a results pane . A banner may be displayed showing featured items as determined by the seller .

As can be seen in a sub menu comprising elements can also be provided which uses a tabular organization. The tabular organization can provide a convenient way for buyers to navigate through the seller s store. In one embodiment by default the items tab is shown which includes the seller s featured listings in the banner and the seller s other listings in the results pane e.g. sorted by newest to oldest. As noted above when a buyer searches the seller s items from the search tool or selects a category name from the category tree the listings returned from the search or those listings falling under the selected category are displayed in the results pane . The tabs can be configured to allow convenient navigation between them. For example if the buyer is viewing the seller s profile in the seller profile tab and decides to search for a listing they can enter a search string into the search tool and select the search button which will automatically bring focus to the Items tab to display the results.

The browse tab is configured to load a browse page e.g. by selecting the browse tab or by selecting a browse link in the category tree s space. An example of the browse page is shown in . As seen in the browse page can be divided into a search section containing click boxes to allow the buyer to use advanced search options similar to the boxes on the main Buy page illustrated in and an expanded tree portion which shows the third tier categories applicable the seller s inventory of listings. In another embodiment a browse page may be displayed to blend both the intermediary s search tool layout and the layout of that seller s item catalogue in their own website. For example if the seller s catalogue requires that buyers specify the make model year and engine size of their vehicle the system may mimic those requirements on the store page in the intermediary . That way buyer s can have a choice search for items the sellers way or by using the standard search tools available on the intermediary e.g. the seller s store may not have tools such as the click boxes to search for items etc. .

Turning back to the seller profile tab can be configured to show upon selection thereof the seller s profile. The profile may include without limitation how long the seller has been in business total number of listings business profile photos and video about the seller and or their place of business etc. A location tab can also provide information regarding the location of the seller . Where privacy concerns are important the location can be shown in a map at a high level e.g. region city or neighbourhood rather than an exact address. This allows the geographic location to be clearly visible but does not provide enough detail to identity the actual business address. A video tab can be selected to enable the buyer to view video content that has been uploaded by the seller . The video content can provide clips of the seller s physical place of business promotional videos testimonials etc. As discussed above buyers can provide feedback to the seller . This feedback can be viewed by potential buyers by selecting a feedback tab . Any user viewing the store front page can also select a leave feedback link to post additional feedback and commentary about the seller and their store listings etc. A buyer can also select an Add to Favourite Sellers link which can add a link within their account to that particular seller to enable them to quickly access that seller s store at a later time.

Referring back to process of setting up a store in one embodiment the first step is to review and modify the store name if desired. For example the store name may be defaulted to the seller s user id. However the seller may wish to use another name or trademark and can then have the opportunity to change the store name to whatever they wish and this may be provided at an additional cost. Also as noted above the name of the store in this embodiment is used as the seller s own personal web address and thus the seller may wish to have this modified for that reason.

The seller may also be able to personalize their store front by choosing from a pre made selection of design templates provided by the system not shown . The templates offer a design skin to improve the appearance of their store and to differentiate it from others. Some templates can be offered at no charge while others can be offered for a fee. The seller can also upload a company logo or trademark to create a brand using the system . Also if the seller has appropriate video they could create a video of their facility and upload it to their store front. Sellers who have registered businesses can also have their business verified by a third party and be given a special distinction or a stamp of approval by the system . Similarly the seller can identify special distinctions or awards they received and indicate in which associations they are active etc. The seller may also choose extra features to include in their store. For example the seller could subscribe to the store manager a unique program that would make managing their inventory simple. In one embodiment the store manager program gives the user advanced features to manage items they are selling similar to the Modify Catalogue option illustrated in or they could subscribe to other supplier s parts catalogues from the Part a Log feature into their store as described later herein.

Sellers can also use their store front to attach advertising pages. In this way the system can restrict the amount of data that the sellers can add to a listing such as advertisements while still providing space to advertise and promote in any way they wish. For example if the seller is currently running a promotion on certain products they could upload their flyers or advertisement to the ad page not shown . As with other value added features the system can be configured to offer such a feature at an additional cost. It may be noted that the administrator can be used to monitor content that is being uploaded to the seller s store front for appropriateness and to inhibit the use of advertising space to circumvent use of the system i.e. to avoid low cost advertising at the expense of the system .

It may be noted that the system provides a virtual community for selling exchanging and promoting businesses and to allow buyers access to various vendors wholesalers recyclers individuals distributors etc. The system can use the categorization database to perform a filtered query to determine different types of users i.e. Recyclers distributors etc. This allows any user of the system to reach potential customers and partners in a convenient way. For example sellers can create and distribute flyers to certain groups or types of users for specific target marketing campaigns.

It can be seen that the store feature is not simply another shopping cart type system that assigns sellers a web domain with e commerce tools. It is a complete set of unique tools for a seller to integrate their stores within the intermediary to help them sell more items increase brand awareness etc. It also provides buyers with powerful focused search tools to find stores and sellers that sell supply manufacture etc. items and or related services they are looking for.

Turning again to the system can also provide a option for selling multiple unique parts consecutively without having to perform all steps in a regular listing. The seller can select the Create a Bin icon to create bins of items such that the items can be organized like shelves in a physical store. The organization of items into bins allows sellers to post items in much less time than a conventional listing while providing the ability to recreate an existing physical store shelf layout in their virtual store. The layout can provide one or more bins organized into different sections and each bin having a group of similar items . For example a number of belt tensioners can be arranged into bins grouped by engine size 3.1 3.4 L 3.8 L etc. .

It has been found that many items in an auto parts recyclers physical location are not necessarily inventoried i.e. not entered into their computer management systems mostly because there is no set part number or because the items are small and do not warrant the time to enter them into their computer system. For example often electrical components such as switches relays plugs and sensors may sell for less than 10.00 each and as such taking the time to enter them into the computer using their standard industry software print a tag out and tag each of these items is not considered feasible let alone desirable. The cost of labour in entering the items is often considered too high and such items are often grouped and stored in non computer inventoried bins on shelves. In this situation when a customer phones the physical store and requests an item the staff would require some knowledge of what is stored where and then would need to go to the appropriate shelf find the appropriate bin or section and sift through its contents to find the requested item.

To overcome these issues bin selling through the system can provide sellers with the unique tools they need to quickly and efficiently sell their inventory through the network . Sellers are then able to create virtual shelves arranged into bins that match the actual physical layout of their physical store. It has also been recognized that many parts recyclers are looking for ways to make more money on the vehicles they dismantle which can be accomplished by selling more parts from a single vehicle. Using the system to organize parts in a convenient and time efficient manner simplifies this task.

By selecting the Create a Bin icon from the main sell menu page a main bin selling page is loaded by the system as shown in . The bin selling page is very similar to the single and multi item selling pages with similar options denoted by the same numerals used in previous figures with a c attached to the end of the numerals which may include a photo preview pane an upload photo link to begin the photo upload process as shown earlier accepted payment methods click boxes a save button a cancel button and an add shipping details link . The required details pane is configured to allow entry of information pertinent to a bin and an optional details pane for adding optional details to the bin as they are added. The optional details pane also shares some similar options that are explained in previous sections attribute tagging click boxes a next button and a previous button not shown to name a few. The optional details pane in this example is organized into four tabular sections a bin details tab an inventory tab a shipping and payment tab and a photos video tab .

The bin required details pane displays the details the seller needs to add before creating their bin. In the example shown in an item type entry box enables the seller to choose a descriptor category and sub category utilizing the same auto fill features discussed above in the list an item listing process. For example as the seller begins to type an item name into the entry box the auto fill tool can access the main category database and display a list of descriptors that match and or are associated with what has been entered with such descriptors broken down into a parts list components lists etc. as exemplified in the above examples. If the seller wishes to browse the categories they can do so by selecting a browse categories link similar to the process explained above. Typically bins are used to organize items of the same sub category to not only simplify searching but also to make the listing process more efficient.

A title entry box is also provided which enables the seller to specify a title for the bin that will be visible to all users that browse their inventory. The title can be displayed on front of the visual representation of the bin see . The name may be limited to a maximum number of characters according to the size of the bin and or the number of bins that will be displayed. A sub title entry box can also be provided to allow the seller to further describe the contents. The sub title can also be made visible to all users and can be located underneath the main title on the front of the bin in smaller text. In the example in the sub title for the bin in the lower left corner of the page is 2005 UP . If the seller has organized items into groups of items in a similar condition a condition drop down box can be used to choose a default condition that will appear for all items in the bin . For example if the seller chooses OEM New as the default condition all items in the bin are presumed to have that condition unless the seller makes a change accordingly. If the items in the bin are used the seller can choose a condition that best matches a majority of the items such as Used Good . Alternatively the seller can create multiple similar bins with items in different conditions. In this way the seller can avoid having to assess and assign a condition to each and every item in the bin . A bin description entry box can be populated to give more details as to the bin s contents. For example a seller may specify that All tensioners were inspected for quality. We have year guarantees on all of our items . When the seller is ready to create their bin they click the create bin button to create the bin and give them access to the Inventory tab which is disabled until a bin is created. That is if the bin is not created the user cannot click the inventory tab since they cannot add inventory to a bin that does not yet exist.

As discussed above in connection with the item by item listing process the seller can review their shipping and payment details in the shipping and payment tab . If the seller has created selling preferences the preferences that were preset will be pre populated in this tab and if they want to modify them they can do so on a bin by bin basis. The system may also be configured to allow sellers to create selling preferences specifically for bin items. By selecting the photos video tab the seller can upload pictures and video to be displayed on the front of the bin . In this way when a buyer views the bin they can select cursor over or otherwise highlight or focus on a bin to view more details as shown in . The picture video can be displayed in a details box that may include the other information associated with the bin . In this way information regarding the bin can be easily accessed without cluttering the appearance. The use of photos and video allows the seller to educate the buyer if they do not know what the item looks like. The seller can select the photo video tab which loads the photo video uploading tools described earlier choose one or more pictures or videos and select upload as described above. The picture that is displayed on the front of the bin is a thumbnail image and if the seller uploads multiple images they can be requested to choose which photo is to be displayed on the bin . As also shown in the bins can be searched using a bin searching tool an advanced search filters option can also be provided for the buyer to target specific bins or items within such bins and the page may be also configured to utilize other searching tools and filters mentioned throughout this document.

The bin details pane allows sellers to include additional optional details. If the contents of the bin are all of the same brand the seller can specify a brand by entering one in a brand entry box . To provide even further details regarding the contents of the bin the seller can also specify the actual physical location of the bin in their physical store by entering a bin location in Location of Bin which can be made private. Bin location information can be recorded to assist the seller in finding the item once it is sold. For example if a buyer purchases a relay from a bin located in Warehouse 1 Rack 2A when the item is sold the bin location can be added to the email sent to the seller so they can quickly find it at their physical location for shipping to the buyer . A rack entry box can also be provided which allows a seller to assign a physical bin to a particular shelf or rack. For example any bins that the seller creates with 27 as the rack number can be automatically grouped and displayed by the system with other bins having the same rack number since they are located on the same rack. This rack number is private and related to the exact position of the bin in the physical store. A private notes entry box can also be provided to the seller to allow them to enter private information about their bin contents. For example the seller may specify Make sure you pack these parts properly because the last time we shipped one of these the courier dropped the box . This system can then access this information and add the private notes to the email sent to the seller notifying them that an item from their bin has been sold. In this way the seller can remind themselves of specific information that they do not necessarily want the buyer to see. Other details options and information may be displayed to further explain the contents of the bin. As mentioned above the seller can also assign attributes to the contents of the bin using the attribute click boxes

Once a bin has been created by a seller the seller then proceeds to the inventory tab to add items to the bin and can later remove items from the bin e.g. if they are sold offline etc. The inventory tab displays an entry form that resembles a spreadsheet. Various descriptive fields are identified and each data row has a corresponding cell to allow the seller to navigate through the form while adding details along the way e.g. by tabbing through the cells. The entry form can also be configured to allow short cut keys to be used such as the tab or enter keys. In one embodiment the enter key can be used to both tab through the entries for all cells except the description cell wherein a carriage return would instead occur.

For the auto parts example described herein the descriptive fields can be similar to those that would be entered in a regular item listing described above and in this example comprises item number make model year condition description part number SKU stock number price quantity private details more details and fees. As above the auto fill tool can be initiated to assist the seller in entering the details. It may be noted that the condition can be different than the representative condition given to the entire bin e.g. some items can be in a different condition. It may also be noted that as seen in for the entry of lengthier details such as for the description field a larger entry box can be initiated temporarily as shown in . Similar to the bin itself the seller can add private notes that are specific to the item which are private to them. The more details field can be used to change any of the selling preferences and other details not shown in this view for that individual item. By selecting the more details field a full listing would then be displayed as shown in . In this way the complete details do not need to be entered in the same way as for a regular listing but the process for modifying the details can be accessed at any time when accessing the inventory in the bin . The fee field can be used to notify the seller of the cost for the listing if there is a fee. A total bin fees tally can be displayed to enable the seller to quickly determine the cost associated with that bin . The system can be configured to hide the fee column and or other columns as well. This figure is used for illustrative purposes only so other columns and details may be included.

To provide further convenience the entry form can be converted and downloaded to a PDF format by selecting a Download PDF form link so the seller can populate the fields offline. Similar to database and spreadsheet interfaces tabbing through the end of an entry can cause the next data row to be created by assigning the next sequential item number. It can be seen that the entry form can allow the seller to quickly add items to a bin from one convenient page rather than having to individually list an item using the process described above. Before listing the bin the seller can select a Save button to save the information without posting it for later completion and once the bin is to be posted the seller can select a Post Items button . As can also be seen in helpful hints can be displayed to assist the seller as they are populating the entry form .

Once the bins are created and listed by the seller there are various ways that the bins can be viewed by potential buyers or browsers. For example the items in a bin can be viewed directly by performing a basic search and viewing the individual item s detailed listing i.e. does not have to be accessed through the bin by browsing through bins a bin tab can be provided as described below by browsing the contents of a bin using standard view by browsing the contents of a bin using a list view or by browsing using a Shelf View to name a few. Each of these examples will now be described.

Performing a basic search is one way of looking at all items or multi items that are posted and match the search criteria. When a buyer performs a search all of the items including bin items appear in the results page shown in . When the search returns bin items a bin tab can be included. The buyer may then select the bin tab to load the bin results and bin detailed listing as exemplified below and illustrated in . are other embodiments of the results page that do not show the bin tab .

When the detailed listing is loaded for a bin item as shown in all of the information for that listing is displayed in a tabular format similar to other listings with the addition of a bin reference portion and a bin picture portion . If the seller did not upload a picture with their bin listing then the picture displayed in the bin detailed listing may display the bin which notifies the buyers that the item is found in a bin as shown in . If the buyer selects the photo portion a new window may then be loaded which then shows the bins contents as will be explained later. If the seller did upload a picture for the listing then the picture portion can display that picture as shown in . The picture portion can be configured such that only selection of the representation of a bin would take the user to the bin listings. The bin reference is included in the listing summary and indicates the bin that the item is from. As shown in a bin link can be included which is associated with the bin name. By selecting the bin link the bin contents can then be loaded.

As noted above bin items can also be browsed by browsing through bins. From the main results page shown in the buyer can select the bin tab and can refine their search from the advanced search menu . For example the buyer could view all bins or view only bins from a particular seller . illustrates an example bin view page which illustrates one embodiment of how the bins can be arranged to make it easy for the buyer to browse through them. If the buyer wishes to see more information without actually clicking the bin they can place their mouse over the bin to bring up a details box as shown in . If the seller wishes to view the bin contents they can select the desired bin .

When a buyer selects a bin the contents may then be displayed in a Standard View by default. A standard view lists all of the bin s items in a manner similar to the way items are displayed in the results page shown in . As seen in when a bin is selected the top of the bin listing page can be configured to display the bin s information the picture of the bin the category sub category and descriptor for the items in the bin the brand the description and the seller s user id. Below is the bin search box that allows the buyer to search only the contents of the bin . The buyer may then select a desired item listed in the standard view to display the bin item s detailed listing . There may be more search tools than illustrated in these examples.

The contents of a bin can also be browsed using a List View . The list view is accessed by selecting a List View tab rather than a Standard View tab . An example list view is shown in wherein the information is organized in the same way as displayed to a seller when they enter items into their bin through the entry form . The list view is also a convenient way to browse through listings where the items do not have a corresponding picture and can provide more detail at the same time which reduces the need for clicking items to view more information. If the buyer wishes to view the bin item s detailed listing they can select any line item click more details or click the buy it link shown in .

The Shelf View allows buyers to view a representation of the actual shelf or rack at a seller s physical location. Shelf View can be used in various ways. For example if a seller has specified the location and rack number of their items the system can automatically group the items in the appropriate shelf based on their location . If the seller allows buyers to use Shelf View the buyers can browse through the items as if they were in the seller s actual physical store. Turning now to a photo of an actual shelf can be obtained and uploaded into a suitable interface. Each item in the photo can then be tagged by the seller so that a buyer can highlight an item using their mouse as seen in the photo and a summary box would then be displayed providing the key item details the buyer may want to know such as but not limited to price sku part numbers type of item etc. A full bin detailed listing may be displayed upon selecting a link in the box not shown or simply by selecting the summary box itself. In this way the virtual shopping experience can be enhanced by bringing the buyer into the seller s physical store to add a level of reality to their shopping experience.

Shelf View makes it easy for sellers because they can take one picture that includes multiple items reducing both the seller s time needed to take the pictures and the upload time required to send the pictures to the system . As shown in for example the photo includes different items .

The bin may also be auto numbered and assigned a unique Bin ID . For example if a user has two bins one can be labelled Bin 1 and the other can be labelled Bin 2 . This helps the seller keep track of how many bins they have. Sellers can also print their bin contents making it easy to reconcile inventory. As well an invoice tool not shown for sellers can be integrated into the system so that sellers could use the system as their inventory and sales management system. This allows the seller to generate invoices run end of day reports etc.

The bin tool can also be used with existing inventory catalogues and items to automatically organize the items into bins based on the type of items they are and other related details. For example a seller that has uploaded their items and or catalogues to the items database can allow the system to take that inventory and organize it into bins for display purposes. Buyers can then browse through the bins to find items to purchase.

Users may also be able to customize their item entry form . For example if a seller feels more comfortable entering the year of vehicle before the make model then the seller could move Year in front of Make Model . DHTML is one suitable technology that may be used for modifying the entry form . In another example if the seller does not enter private information they could hide the Private Field from the entry form .

The system can offer certain specialty tags or bin skins at an additional cost. The purpose of such specialty tags can be to make the seller s bin stand out and attract more buyers . For example the seller could purchase Hot Item Limited Edition or Great Deal tags to display in the top right corner of their bin. In another example a seller with a bin full of chrome racing wheels could purchase a skin to make their bin appear to be brilliant shiny chrome to reflect their chrome wheels.

The system incorporates a mechanism for suppliers sellers and buyers to effectively manage the sale and distribution of items herein referred to as the Part a Log . The Part a Log acts as a master catalogue for all parts contained within the system .

Suppliers upload their product catalogues to the system having the intermediary ensure that their data integrates seamlessly with inventory naming conventions used by both buyers and sellers . For example data conforming to ACES Internet Parts Ordering IPO Parts Information Exchange Standard PIES Shop Connectivity Standard i.Shop or a supplier s custom way of organizing data can be merged into the common standard utilized by the system . The supplier has the option of selling items through chosen sellers or directly to buyers . A supplier that chooses only to sell through approved sellers can have their inventory catalogue available for viewing to sellers but items can only be purchased through said sellers . A seller wanting to sell a supplier s items must apply to and be approved by the said supplier . Once approved a buyer can view and purchase supplier s items through the seller . This system eliminates the need for paper catalogues facilitates making changes to updated pricing and product information and maintains the integrity of the distribution network a critical requirement in the industry. Also the Part a Log provides buyers with a choice of sellers carrying the same supplier s inventory. Payment to the supplier depends on the relationship between the seller and a supplier . If the seller already has an account setup through their physical bricks and mortar store the supplier may charge the seller s bricks and mortar charge account. If the supplier and the seller have never done business before the supplier may require that the seller prepay the items. The choice is ultimately up to the supplier and seller not the administrator .

To become a supplier and setup their supplier account the user would click either the Part a Log link not shown found in the Account link or by selecting the Parts Catalogue option from the main sell menu page shown in to be brought to the main Part a Log Control Panel as shown in . The Part a Log application may also have its own web interface and allow the user to go through that interface over the network to also arrive at the Part a Log Control Panel. This web interface would be directly connected to the system and may share the categorization database .

The left menu shown in displays the general Part a Log control panel tabs that both the supplier and seller have access to. Once the user makes the decision to become a supplier and is approved by the administrator more tabs will be available specifically for suppliers as discussed below. The user sees two links within the Part a Log Control Panel workspace the first time they arrive there a Become a Supplier link and a Become a Seller link . If user wishes to learn more about the different account types they could click the more info links to open a new window displaying information on each not shown . At the bottom of the Control Panel workspace is a Part a Log information area which explains what the Part a Log is how it works and what it can do for the user etc.

To become a supplier the user would click on the Become a Supplier link and be brought to a window featuring a supplier information box containing details about becoming a supplier such as what is a supplier how it works what is required to become a supplier etc as shown in . When the user is satisfied and wants to continue they would click the Apply Now button to take them to the supplier application page as illustrated in .

The supplier application page displays the application form that the user is required to fill out. Before the user becomes an active supplier the system and or the administrator conducts a review to ensure that the supplier is a valid business and follows other security measures to check the user. In some cases if the supplier wishes to be distinguished as being a Verified Supplier the system will work with key third party companies to review the supplier . Some parts of this review are automated while others require the administrator .

The supplier application page requires general business information . This does not include their contact information telephone number email address etc. as this information is obtained through the registration for the system user account as previously outlined. The user describes the nature of their business in the Business Description box and selects a Business descriptor most relevant to their business. The supplier application page also requests that the user completes a primary markets field and indicate whether their business has a physical store . The user can also include any additional comments pertaining to their business deemed important to the administrator . Once the form is complete they would click the Send Application button to send it to the administrator for review.

As demonstrated in once the application is sent the date and time they sent the application is displayed as well as the status of their application. The different stages are but not limited to Received Waiting for Review In Review and either Unsuccessful or Approved . These appear in the main workspace for the users who have applied to become suppliers . Once the administrator approves the supplier the user s status changes and they are sent an email welcoming them and giving them instructions on how to upload their inventory not shown . A copy of the email is also sent to their Inbox in their Message Centre as discussed below. The supplier also gains full access to supplier Part a Log control panel tabs displayed along the left hand side of the Part a Log Control panel workspace as shown in .

Once the user is a registered supplier they can upload their product data to the system . The two most common ways of doing so include uploading their inventory file in an accepted file format such as but not limited to .cvs or .xls not shown and for larger suppliers or suppliers with advanced integrated systems such as EDI the system can link to their data network to receive constant updates on products by API s provided by the administrator and or supplier or by using another technology. No uploading is required in this example.

As discussed earlier each supplier may store their data differently. The system and the administrator will work with each supplier to ensure their data integrates seamlessly into the system platform and categorization database . If the supplier chooses to upload their inventory by a single file they would do so through the My Inventory Catalog tab on the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs .

Referring to along the left hand side of the screen is the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs which the user can select to navigate through the various supplier s functions. This includes the Dashboard Sales Orders Distributor Requests Message Centre My Distributors My Inventory Catalog My Account My Selling Preferences and Help tabs. The Distributor Requests and My Distributors tabs are specific to suppliers and are added to the general Part a Log control panel tabs once the user becomes a registered supplier . Each of the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs will be discussed herein.

The user has the ability to customize the display of the Dashboard tab Part a Log control panel workspace by clicking the Customize Dashboard link in the top right corner of the page.

The Sales Orders tab is where all of the sales and order information are located and organized. When a seller sells an item to a buyer through the system an order is automatically placed by the seller to the supplier for that sold item. The best way to illustrate this is by the following example. The seller had applied to a supplier to sell their products and was approved by the supplier . The next day a buyer searches the system and finds an air filter they wish to purchase from the seller . The air filter is a product from the supplier that the seller doesn t actually physically have in stock. They have it in their virtual inventory meaning that if the seller sells it they will need to buy it from the supplier before sending it to the buyer . So the buyer decides to purchase the air filter and pays the seller . The seller then receives confirmation of the payment from the buyer and an order is then automatically sent to the supplier for the air filter by the seller . Depending on what arrangement the seller and the supplier have the seller may or may not have prepaid the item. Some suppliers offer credit to their sellers meaning that the sellers don t have to pay for every item individually before ordering it. For the purposes of this example we will assume that the seller had to prepay the air cleaner. Once the seller pays the supplier for the air cleaner the supplier either sends it to the seller or ships it directly to the buyer depending on the way the seller and supplier have setup their account .

As shown in there are four separate sections in the Sales Orders tab Summary New Orders Open Orders and Completed Orders .

When the user selects the Summary tab a snapshot of the supplier s performance is displayed in the Part a Log control panel workspace . The top of the page as shown in features an order summary section which displays the number of new orders open orders and completed orders the supplier has received from sellers . Also the page features a sales summary section that translates their orders into dollar figures so the supplier could see hard dollar values of their performance. The sales summary also shows the supplier their sales by current day week current month and current year. The Top 3 Sellers section features the supplier s top three sellers . The seller s business names are displayed along with their dollar sales figures and their location. If the supplier wants to view the seller s account they would click the business name to view the seller s profile in greater detail.

When user selects the New Orders tab listed under the Sales Orders tab the order details for when the supplier receives orders for their products are displayed illustrated by . The new orders list are displayed in order of when they were received with the newest order at the top. The supplier can change the way the orders are sorted to oldest to newest if they wish by clicking the Date Received title . The orders shown on this page are in summary farm showing only the buyer s user ID business name item descriptor SKU Stock number shipping location of the buyer and the date the order was received. To view the full order details the supplier would click the View link beside the order to bring up the full order details.

The full order details depicted in provide all the information for a particular order. For example in one embodiment the Part a Log control panel workspace displays information for the Order Details Item Details and Seller Details . Additional information may be added for display.

The Order Details section states the Order ID number generated by the system . This number cannot be changed and is used for tracking and reporting within the system . Also the Order Date Time in the format of day of week month day year time EST and the category path the item was listed in i.e. Auto Parts Body Parts Hood is shown. Under the Status heading within the Order Details section the status is set to Ordered when the item is ordered and the method of payment is also indicated. If the supplier requires that the seller prepays all items the status will show Payment Received indicating when the seller has paid the supplier . If the supplier allows the seller to charge items then the status will indicate Charged on Account once the supplier has filled the order. This is explained in greater detail below.

The Items Details section provides information relating specifically to the item order by the seller such as the headline stock numbers and condition of item. The listing ID is generated when the supplier listed the item in their inventory and is used for tracking the listing. This is different than the order ID as there can only be one unique order ID every order is considered unique but there can be multiple orders with the same listing ID different orders with the same items sold . For example a fuel tank for a 90 Chev Blazer is listing ID 123456. Six different sellers order the same fuel tank so although the listing ID 123456 is the same for all six orders they ordered the same item each order is different so they will have different order IDs . The item cost is an optional field that displays the cost of the item for the supplier. Due to constantly changing prices the item cost is displayed for convenience for the supplier in reviewing their selling prices. For example let s assume that the cost of the supplier s item increased to 50. If the supplier sees that the selling price is 49.00 they will know immediately that a 1.00 gross profit is impractical. This is very helpful with items whose cost changes frequently. The system also uses this field to calculate the mark up for the item based on the price charged to sellers .

The Seller Details section displays business information regarding the seller of the item. The account terms determined by the supplier at the time they approved the seller are also displayed. Some suppliers deal with sellers that already have accounts setup through their bricks and mortar stores. In these cases most of the time the suppliers don t require the seller to prepay each item individually since they will charge their brick and mortar store charge account. If the supplier and seller have never done business before then the supplier will likely require the seller to prepay all items before they are shipped. Whichever option the supplier chooses they must specify it in the terms . The example in shows that under the terms heading the supplier requires the seller to prepay all items. This is later explained in more detail. Seller comments allow the seller to enter comments that appear on every order form. The example in shows that the seller s comments were If you re shipping Fed Ex my account number is 58555555. Please send it collect. This makes it easy for the seller to communicate special information pertaining to their orders. The seller can update this any time and the changes will appear on all new orders immediately. Also displayed within the Part a Log control panel workspace is an item picture . The item picture shows the default picture displayed in the item s detailed listing . If no photos are available the outline of the photo will remain in place with the words No Photo Available . Clicking this item picture area will load up the actual detailed listing in a new window allowing the supplier to view the full listing as the buyer and seller see it.

The supplier can click the Print Order link in the top right corner of the page to print out a copy of the order details. Another embodiment of the order details incorporates an Email Order link that will allow the supplier to email the order not shown . This is useful for larger companies.

Once the item is packaged and ready to be shipped the supplier can click the Complete Order button . This will bring the supplier to a new page that allows them to enter in the tracking information if they wish not shown . Some suppliers will not do this if they are shipping multiple items to the seller . For example assume the seller has had an account with a supplier for over 20 years. The seller subscribed to the supplier s inventory to make it easier to sell. The seller places regular stock orders through their bricks and mortar store with the supplier on a weekly basis thus forcing the supplier to enter in detailed tracking information every time they sell an item through the system would be too time consuming and unnecessary. In this instance simply by clicking the Complete Order button the seller will know that the order has been processed that is the supplier has charged the item to the seller s account and the item has been packaged and shipped or will be shipped once their regular stock order is shipped. Clicking the Complete Order button will also move the order from the Open Orders section to the Completed Orders .

Once the supplier views the new order as shown in the order is moved to the Open Orders section as they are no longer considered new and not yet completed. To close out an order the supplier must click the Complete Order button to move it into the Completed Orders section . The Open Orders view is similar to the new orders view showing a new order list . This is illustrated in where like elements to those shown in are given like numerals with the suffix a for clarity. The Completed Orders tab view not shown lists completed orders for the supplier s reference. Completed orders remain in the system for 6 months after which time they are cleared out. Suppliers are therefore encouraged to print out hard copies of their order details for their records.

As shown in distributor requests are sent to the supplier by sellers wanting to sell the supplier s products. The Distributor Requests section manages the supplier s distributor requests and is broken up into four sections. The summary tab gives the supplier a quick overview of how many distributor requests pending requests and declined requests the supplier has. When the Distributor Requests tab is clicked the summary page not shown is displayed by default. The New Requests tab displays all of the new requests sent to the supplier . When a seller applies to a supplier the seller is listed on this page for supplier to review. The page displays the seller s user ID business name only if they are a business the contact name location of the seller if they are a current customer of the supplier and the date the supplier received the request.

The Pending Requests tab displays all of the seller applications for which the supplier clicked the Decide Later button . This allows the supplier to review the applications at their convenience. The sellers are organized exactly as shown within the New Requests tab . Once the supplier is ready to make a decision they would click the View link beside the appropriate seller application. They would have the same three buttons available Approve Decide Later and Decline not shown .

The Declined Requests tab displays all of the applications that the supplier declined not shown . The sellers are organized exactly as shown within the New Requests and Pending Requests tabs. If the supplier changes their mind and decides they want to approve one of their declined sellers they would click the View link beside the appropriate seller application. An Approve button would be displayed on the page allowing the supplier to change their mind. If they click this a notification would be displayed telling the supplier that they are about to approve a declined seller . Once they confirm the seller information and application is moved into the My Distributors tab not shown .

Continuing with the Message Center tab is the central location where all correspondence from sellers potential sellers and the system is organized and where the supplier can create and send messages from. Three links appear on the side menu under messages Inbox Compose Message and Sent Messages . For convenience the same links are also organized into Message Centre headings in the message area of the Part a Log control panel workspace .

As soon as the supplier clicks on the Message Center tab they are defaulted into the Inbox to read messages immediately. When the supplier has new unread mail the words New Messages appear in the top right corner of their screen not shown . Clicking this also takes them into their inbox . The message list is organized by From Subject Type and Date . The From heading displays the user ID i.e. the seller name . If the message is from the administrator JustParts would appear in the From field. The subject line displays the subject specified by the message sender. The Type field displays the type of message it is. Examples of different message types are System Message Seller Inquiry Order Confirmation etc. This makes it easy and convenient for the supplier to sort the message list when there are many messages. For example the supplier may want to read only their Order Confirmations instead of filtering through all of their mail. The date shows the day of the week month day year and time in EST. To view the full message the supplier would click the subject of the message they wish to read. The page then refreshes and shows the message not shown .

Other embodiments of this feature include a notification system allowing the administrator to send automated system messages. For example if a supplier hasn t paid their system invoice the system can send an automated reminder message to the user.

The Compose Message tab or selecting Compose Message from the Message Centre headings will bring the supplier to the application where they could compose a message not shown . To compose a message the supplier would enter the name of the recipient. The name would automatically appear by the auto fill tool if the recipient is one of the supplier s sellers . For example the seller Tbauto is one of the supplier s sellers so by typing Tb in the To field Tbauto would appear in the results as a suggestion. The supplier could arrow down to select it. The auto fill tool works by user ID business name and contact name. Typing in any of those three in the auto fill would pull up a suggested match. This is convenient for the supplier as most messages they compose will be to users in their address book. When a message is sent a copy is placed under the Sent Messages tab . If the supplier wants to view the messages they sent they could view them by clicking the Sent Messages tab .

The My Distributors tab is where the supplier can view all of their seller s details and information. Under the My Distributors tab the user can select the Summary Distributor Details or Suspended tabs.

When a supplier clicks on the My Distributors tab the Summary tab is shown immediately as illustrated in . The summary tab displays a list of the supplier s sellers similar to the listing provided under the Distributor Requests tab illustrated in . For clarity like elements are given like numerals with the suffix . The list of the suppliers sellers are organized by user ID business name contact name location and seller since date . To view the details about individual sellers the supplier would click the View link beside the seller s user ID . This will show seller s details and the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs changes to the Distributor Details tab .

As demonstrated in under the Distributor Details tab a supplier can view the details of a seller all details from their application form are displayed in the form window . The top details section displays all the information that was available in the summary tab along with two links a View Seller s JustParts Store link which would direct the supplier to the seller s store and a Send Message to Seller link that when clicked would open the compose message page in the message center . Another embodiment of this feature can include a link Sales Info which would allow the supplier to click the link to view the sales activity of the seller not shown .

If the supplier does not wish the seller to sell their inventory the supplier would click the Suspend button . When a seller is suspended they no longer have access to the supplier s inventory and all listings containing their inventory are suspended that is not visible to buyers . When a seller is suspended an email is sent to both the supplier and seller confirming the suspension. At the bottom of the Part a Log control panel workspace a display box shows all of the details found on the seller s original application see subsequent . A search tool not shown would allow the supplier to search for a particular seller . Also clicking the seller name would open their seller profile on the system .

The Suspended tab provides a seller list of all the sellers the supplier has suspended as shown in . The sellers are listed in a similar format as the Distributor Requests tab and the My Distributors Summary tab therefore like elements are given like numerals with the suffix for clarity. Also the seller s suspended date is displayed. To view the seller s full details the supplier would click the View link beside the seller s user ID . Clicking the View link would open up the seller details page that is identical to the Distributor Details shown in with one difference the Suspend button is now a Reactivate Seller button not shown . Clicking this will re enable the seller to sell the supplier s inventory. They will be moved from the Suspended tab to the Summary and My Distributors tab . A notes field at the bottom of the Part a Log control panel workspace will allow the supplier to add comments about the seller adding convenience for suppliers that have many associated sellers . For example if a supplier reviews their suspended sellers after months they may not remember the reason why they suspended them in the first place. illustrates how a supplier can add a comment for a suspended seller because they did not pay their account for items they purchased. After months the suspended sellers are cleared out of the system automatically if they haven t been reactivated.

The My Inventory Catalog tab is where all of the supplier s items they are selling are located. There are three main sections within the Inventory Catalog tab . They are Summary Modify Catalog and Other Details .

When the user Clicks the My Inventory Catalog tab the system defaults to the summary section which gives the supplier a summary of their inventory. The summary section depicted in states the total number of items the supplier has in their catalogue at the top of the Part a Log control panel workspace . Below that the an item list breaks down the item total into major category headings such as AC Heating Cooling or Body Parts Exterior giving the supplier a good indication of the types of items they have listed on the system .

As explained earlier there are many different standards that are used in the auto industry to ensure that suppliers and sellers data are linked properly. Some of the more widely adopted standards known to one skilled in the industry include the ACES IPO PIES and i.Shop. The method that the supplier uses to sync their data into the system is stated under the Data Synchronization Type heading .

If the supplier manually uploads a file of their inventory to sync with the system the name of the file last uploaded is displayed under the File Name heading . If the method used for syncing data between the system and the supplier doesn t require manually uploading files the name of the method will be in place of the file name . For example some suppliers will sync their data automatically through different means such as EDI or through an API. In these instances either EDI or API would be displayed in the file name field . Also stated is the Catalog Available Since data showing the date when their catalog first became available to sellers on the system . Under the Last Updated heading the date of the last time the supplier synced their catalog with the system is stated. If the supplier uses automated data syncing such as EDI Automated Data Syncing Enabled would be shown under Last Updated . If there was a problem with the communication between the system and the supplier s data the date and time of the last full sync would be displayed. If the supplier uploads files to update their catalog they can upload a new inventory file by clicking the Sync Catalog button . This will open up an upload window not shown where they can choose their new file and upload it to the system to be synced.

If the supplier wants to modify an item in their catalog they can do so without having to re upload another file and sync it. The benefit of uploading a file and syncing is that it is easy and convenient especially when a supplier has many changes. However if there are minimal changes a supplier may choose to make those changes directly to their catalog on the system . To edit items within the system the supplier would click on the Modify Catalog tab from the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs . As shown in the top of the Part a Log control panel workspace features the same information found in top of the summary tab page. Underneath is the supplier s inventory organized exactly as it was uploaded and synced and displayed in a spreadsheet style called Edit View . The first column is a sequential list that matches the item line. For example the first line is row the tenth line is row and so on. This makes it easy for the supplier when referring back to their spreadsheet file such as excel if they need to change something on row in their excel spreadsheet file then they can quickly navigate to row in their inventory file on the system . This makes modifying data very convenient. Furthermore every second line is a different shade to make it easy for the supplier to read.

Editing listings in the Edit View is a fast and easy way as opposed to going through My Account to make the changes because the supplier can immediately change the contents of an individual cell. demonstrates a workflow example of the Edit View for changing inventory details for a supplier . In first section block it is assumed that the supplier wants to change the price of their 94 98 Chev Model air pump from 56.00 to 62.00. They would simply click the price cell in row 3 and type in 62 as shown in second section block . That cell would be highlighted in yellow indicating it was modified. The Supplier can do the same in all fields. For the make model and year fields in this example the same features explained earlier in the Vehicle Details tab would be available to the supplier . In those fields the Supplier may use the auto fill tool or type their own details not found in the categorization database .

Returning to if the Supplier wants to edit the return policy or other information that isn t displayed in this view for a particular item they would click the View link in column 2 beside the item to open the full edit view as shown in . It may be noted that when a supplier changes item details it affects every seller that has subscribed to the supplier s catalog as the changes will take effect immediately once the supplier saves their changes. It is the supplier s responsibility for maintaining their inventory and ensuring that it is correct. For example if the supplier removes an item from their catalogue buyers will no longer be able to purchase that item therefore the seller will not be able to sell that item from the supplier . Also the system may be configured to give the seller tools to automatically adjust their pricing based on the suppliers cost. For example if a supplier increases the price of an item the seller will likely not know about it and thus not change their selling price. Therefore the seller may use these tools to set their selling price to automatically adjust so the seller for example makes a minimum of 20 profit on each sale. If the supplier increases the cost of an item then the system can automatically increase the seller s selling price for that item to compensate for the higher cost.

If the Supplier wants to search for a particular item they can do so using the search tool at the top of their Edit View pane. The search returns matching results by highlighting the row or rows in yellow. For example shows the supplier searched for part number 25336 so row 11 688 is highlighted because it matched the search criteria. Other search tools explained earlier can also be used by the supplier but not shown in the Figure.

Business accounts will have special features that will allow the user who registered to be the account administrator that can give permissions to other users within their business to modify their system catalogue etc. For example the supplier s manager or owner may want to only be able to change their catalogue information. A further embodiment of this feature is to add the ability for the user to track changes to their catalog. For example if the user wants to see who changed the price of an item from 100 to 10 they could do so. When the supplier has finished making their changes and tries to navigate away from the Modify Catalogue page they are prompted to save the catalogue not shown . If the changes are saved they take effect immediately and the Last Updated field is updated to reflect the new date and time.

If the supplier wants to re upload a file instead of modifying it within the system they would click the Browse For New File link found under the Sync Catalog button . A file uploading tool not shown would appear allowing the supplier to search for their file. The supplier would then select the file and click the Upload File button to upload it to their Modify Catalog page in the system . Once it s uploaded the supplier could preview the file before syncing. The Last Updated field displays New File. Catalog Not Synced while the Sync Catalog button is red reminding the Supplier that they have not synced their file. Clicking the Sync Catalog button will sync the catalog. The changes take effect immediately and all sellers will have the updated version of their catalog.

Further embodiments of the Modify Catalog tab incorporate the option of adding and removing items from the Edit View so the Supplier can customize the columns. For example if the supplier only wants to see the make model year price and sku stock number columns in the Edit View they can hide all the other columns part numbers description etc . They can always unhide them later at any time. Another embodiment involves adding Enable Disable Quick Entry links not shown so the supplier can choose whether to modify their data by clicking in and changing the contents of a cell. Some suppliers would rather open the full listing before changing anything shown in . For example the supplier may find it too easy to change a cell accidentally by simply clicking in the cell so they may want to disable this feature making it impossible to change any cell unless they open the item in the full edit view shown in . This is similar to locking a worksheet in a Microsoft Excel application preventing unauthorized changes from happening accidentally.

The Other Details tab under the Inventory Catalog display other features related to the supplier s catalog not shown .

The My Account tab under the Supplier Part a Log control panel tabs lists all information pertaining to the Supplier such as contact information business information account type billing and invoice information and other information from their original supplier application form. Any changes the supplier wishes to make would be done through this tab .

The supplier s selling preferences are all listed in the My Selling Preferences tab . Selling preferences include information but is not limited to Ship To Locations Accepted Methods of Payment Return Policy Warranty Currency and other Shipping details. The supplier can make any global changes to these preferences directly from here. Selling preferences allow the supplier to preset all of their standard information that in most cases doesn t change from item to item like a supplier s warranty and return policy. Another embodiment includes a feature that will allow the supplier to create different selling preferences for different part types. For example the supplier may want separate warranty and return policies for engines and power window motors. This selling preferences page is similar to the page explained earlier in the item listing process.

The Help tab features videos and help documentation to assist suppliers with using the parts catalog application.

Sellers in the context of the part catalogue application are defined as any user who applies to a particular supplier to sell their products. For example if the company Tbauto applied to sell a supplier s inventory and was approved Tbauto would be considered a seller of that said supplier . Typically the supplier determines if a seller is approved or declined not the system or the administrator .

To become a seller the user would click either the Part a Log link found in their My Account or in the Sell menu to be brought to the main Part a Log Control Panel as shown in . In contrast to becoming a supplier as discussed previously the user would click on the Become a Seller link and be brought to a page not shown which would feature more detailed information about becoming a seller what is a seller how it works what is required to become a seller etc . There will be a Don t Show Me This Again link that will allow the seller to bypass this information page the next time they return not shown . When the user is satisfied and wants to continue they would click the Search For Suppliers link not shown to take them to the main Search Suppliers page shown in .

Once the user has selected the Become a Seller link the seller Part a Log control panel tabs will appear. The seller Part a Log control panel tabs are similar to the Supplier Part a Log control panel tabs including a Dashboard tab a Sales Orders tab a Search Suppliers tab a Message Centre tab a My Suppliers tab a My Inventory Catalogs tab a My Account tab a My Selling Preferences tab and a Help tab .

The Search Suppliers tab illustrated in allows the user to find a desired supplier from all the available suppliers on the system . The top of the search page offers a sub menu that allows the user to search for suppliers by supplier name brand and category to name a few. By default the Supplier item is highlighted. The seller has four ways to find and view a supplier 

The user could click on any of the suppliers from the supplier list section shown on the page. They are listed in alphabetical order. For example shows a supplier list containing suppliers whose name starts with A and B. The user could click on any of the names displayed such as Acer Tire to bring up their Supplier profile. As well the user could select the See All Suppliers link to view a list of all suppliers in the system .

The user could search for a Supplier using the Search Suppliers tool at the top of the page. Other search tools explained earlier can be used as well although not shown in the Figure. For example using the click boxes the user can locate suppliers that sell Honda fenders by choosing Auto Parts Accessories Body Parts Exterior Accessories Fenders and Honda from the click boxes.

The user could click on a featured supplier which appears under the alphabetical list near the top of the Part a Log control panel workspace .

The user could click on a letter from the alphabet selector tool to display all suppliers whose business name starts with the letter they chose. If the supplier s business name starts with a number such as 1 Stop Auto the user would click the 0 9 link to show all suppliers whose business name starts with a number.

The Brand tab from the sub menu loads a page not shown that resembles the Supplier page to display suppliers by brand. If the user clicks on a letter such as M all suppliers that sell brands that begin with M are displayed. Similarly when the user clicks the Category tab a page not shown loads which allows the seller to browse different categories and sub categories and view all suppliers that sell products in that category sub category. For example the seller may want to find a supplier that sells Blower Motors so they would click the Blower Motor sub category.

When the seller finds a supplier they are interested in and clicks on them they are bought to a display of the supplier s profile as illustrated in . The top section of the Part a Log control panel workspace displays summary information about the supplier s business. An Add to Favourites link allows the user to add the supplier to their favourite sellers list not shown . A Contact Supplier link takes the seller to the message center where they can ask the supplier a question. The top section also displays a multimedia application such as picture or video showing the seller the supplier s facility location.

The lower section of the Part a Log control panel workspace is separated into heading tabs . The Company Profile tab shows the entire company profile including all public non private information listed on the supplier application form. The Markets tab displays information about the major markets the supplier targets and ships to. For example the markets tabs may show that a supplier s products cater to the European market. A North American seller who has no intention of shipping to Europe would disregard this supplier . The Photos Video tab displays uploaded videos and photos by the supplier . The Feedback tab allows the seller to view the feedback score and comments other sellers have given the supplier . An example of a comment is Auto Zone is a great company to deal with. Their products are great quality and their customer service is second to none The Catalogue tab displays the supplier s up to date catalog for the seller to browse through and see the items they have for sale.

At the bottom of the top section there is an Apply Now button that when selected loads the seller application page illustrated in . This is an example of an application form the seller needs to fill out and send to the supplier if they want to subscribe to a supplier s catalogue and order from the supplier .

The seller application page requires the seller to give their company information similar to that required in the Supplier Application page therefore like elements are given like numerals with the suffix a for clarity. The seller application page contains fields for general business information a business description box a business descriptor section a primary markets section a physical store inquiry and an area for the seller to add any additional comments for the supplier . The seller application page also requires the seller to complete a credit account field to verify the sellers payment method. As explained earlier some sellers may already have a business relationship with the supplier and therefore already have a charge account setup through their bricks and mortar store. Other sellers will be new to the supplier and therefore may need to pre pay all items before they are shipped. These are two examples of payment methods although there can be more. Once the seller application page is complete the seller would click the Send Application button to submit it to the Supplier they are applying to. Once the seller application is sent to the supplier the seller can track the status of the application through their Message Centre in the Account and in the seller Part a Log control panel tabs .

Similar to the submission of a supplier application page discussed previously the user is brought to a status page not shown similar to that illustrated in . The date and time the seller sent the application to the supplier is displayed as well as the status of their application. The different stages are but not limited to Received Waiting for Review In Review Approved and Not Approved . If the supplier approves the seller the status changes to Approved and if the supplier declines the seller s request Not Approved is displayed. Once the seller is approved they are sent an email welcoming them and giving them an overview of how being a seller works. A copy of the email is also sent to their Message Centre . The seller immediately gains full access to supplier s catalogue once they are approved by the supplier . If the seller applied to more than one supplier the page may be configured to show all of the suppliers the seller applied to with the status beside each of the suppliers not shown .

As stated above once a seller clicks on Become a Seller link they have access to the seller Part a Log control panel tabs . The seller Dashboard tab illustrated in provides the seller with a convenient overview of the important information and activity in their account. It is similar to the dashboard tab of the supplier except that the information displayed applies to sellers not suppliers. There are 6 windows displaying different information. The Account Details window shows the seller what seller package they are enrolled in their next billing date their current account balance and other account related details. The My Suppliers window gives the seller a summary of the suppliers they have subscribed to. The suppliers business names are shown. The New Suppliers Available window shows the seller new suppliers that are available on the system . The user can click the business name of a supplier from the New Suppliers Available window to display the supplier s profile. The Sales Snapshot window shows the seller the dollar value of their sales they generated through the Part a Log application. The sales are broken down by today week current month and current year. As well the seller s top 3 suppliers are displayed based on sales. The My Catalogs window may show the seller s top 5 selling items. The Where I m Selling window shows the seller a map of where they are selling their items. If the seller wishes to customize their Dashboard tab they can do so by clicking the Customize Dashboard link in the top right corner of the Part a Log control panel workspace . This arrangement is one example of the workspace panel layout and other embodiments can display other information in a variety of layouts.

The seller Sales Orders tab is similar to the Sales Orders tab described in the supplier section. The difference is that the seller is purchasing the item from the supplier then selling it to the buyer therefore the Sales Order information section is broken up into two parts a the buyer s orders and b the purchase orders from the supplier . The Sales Orders pages will house all of the information regarding the sale of the item as outlined in the supplier section. For example the New Orders page not shown will not only show the seller the buyer information e.g. what they sold who they sold to where the item will be shipped if the buyer paid for the item etc. but it will show purchase order details for the sale e.g. which supplier the item they sold is purchased from the purchase price if the supplier is shipping direct to the buyer if the item has been pre paid or charged etc. The Sales Orders pages for sellers will therefore contain all of the buyer and supplier details for each sale. All information in the new orders open orders and completed orders tabs not shown are similar to the supplier tabs described in earlier sections.

The seller Message Centre tab is the same as described for the supplier Message Centre in the prior sections however it is designed for the seller not the supplier .

The My Suppliers tab is similar to the My Distributors tab in the Supplier section however the seller s suppliers are listed rather than the supplier s sellers . This tab allows the seller to view their suppliers profiles contact the suppliers view their catalogues etc.

The My Inventory tab will load the seller s catalogs they have subscribed to and organize them based on supplier brand category sub category descriptor etc. The seller can view the catalogs similar to the process illustrated in the supplier section shown in however the seller cannot modify the catalogue items. They can send questions to the supplier about the catalog or about a certain product in the catalogue and they can set pricing rules that allows them to set min and max profit percentages etc. The rules can be added globally that is for all items or they can be set by category sub category or descriptor. For example a seller may set their minimum gross profit percentage for each item sold in the Electrical category at 20 and for the Engine category at 35 . Therefore all item prices will be set accordingly.

The My Account My Selling Preferences and Help tabs under the seller Part a Log control panel tabs are the same as those listed under the supplier Part a Log control panel tabs stated previously.

Another embodiment of the system described herein may incorporate an application that allows users to indicate what other items their products will fit or interchange with. For example a fender from a 1987 Ford F 150 Pick Up truck will also fit a 1988 1989 1990 and 1991 Ford F 150 Pick Up truck. This application is referred to herein as AlsoFits . The said AlsoFits application functions to facilitate the seller s entry of additional compatibility fitment information to their listing for the purpose of increasing the probability of a buyer finding their listing and thereby selling the item. It does this by offering the seller a variety of suggestions from other sellers to choose herein referred to as AlsoFits Suggestions. It includes ratings and comments by other users. To further enhance this feature and make it truly powerful AlsoFits is built to be user generated allowing users to help build the AlsoFits database within the system . This Web 2.0 functionality will make it easy for others to share their knowledge.

In one embodiment the AlsoFits application is integrated into the system defined herein. In another embodiment the said AlsoFits application could be its own free standing website www.alsofits.com . Users can use AlsoFits.com as a reference to determine what other applications their items fit or are compatible with and or add their own knowledge to the platform. In turn the information is shared on the system so that when a seller lists an item AlsoFits suggests other uses compatibility that the seller may want to add to their listing to make it easier for buyers to find the item.

It is noted that although the AlsoFits application can be used in numerous industries for the purposes of this disclosure all examples and explanations will involve the automotive industry.

For example a user of the AlsoFits application adds that a fender from a 1990 Pontiac Bonneville will also fit a 1991 1992 1993 and 1994 providing that it is from a 4 door model. The user may have done this through the system or through the free standing website www.AlsoFits.com . The next day a seller goes to the system to sell a fender from his 1994 Bonneville. The system asks the seller if he wants to include the information that AlsoFits user added the day before. The seller can choose to include it or not. The seller in this example adds the information since he didn t know his fender was compatible with the other model years and finishes the listing. The following day a buyer searches for a fender for his 1992 Bonneville and the seller s listing appears and so he purchases it. Although the seller previously did not know that his 1990 Bonneville fender was the same as a 1990 1993 Pontiac Bonneville the seller sold his item because of the data that the AlsoFits user provided.

The AlsoFits application is available through the Sell tab as illustrated in . When a user lists an item using the Sell feature as previously explained through the system takes a unique approach by giving the seller the opportunity to add general or specific information about their item. The AlsoFits application is integrated into the vehicle details tab in the single item selling process as described in therefore like elements are given like numerals with the suffix for clarity. illustrates an example of a seller creating a listing for 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt engine. The category path for the descriptor engine is shown below the what are you selling field . In this example the system automatically selected the Auto Parts Engine Parts Engine Assemblies category and sub category . As well the seller in this example preset their shipping methods in their selling preferences to free shipping so they system shows the seller their current shipping method . To change the shipping method the seller would click the change link beside free shipping to bring the seller to the shipping and payment tab where they can modify their details.

The AlsoFits feature plugs into vehicle details tab below the data fields . As depicted in an AlsoFits indicator notifies the seller that there is compatibility data that matches information entered into their data fields and the what are you selling field . When there are AlsoFits suggestions from other users an X AlsoFits Entries Matching note appears in the AlsoFits window with the X representing the total number of suggestions available. The example shown in indicates that there are three alsofits entries that match the 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt engine . The system uses the information added by the seller e.g. descriptor make model and year etc. and cross references the alsofits database to determine the suggestions. If the seller wants to see the matching alsofits suggestions they would click the View link to display them as shown in . An AlsoFits suggestion pane appears. If the seller wishes to hide the AlsoFits suggestion pane they would select the Hide link to hide the alsofits pane as shown in or select the Close AlsoFits Window link .

The AlsoFits suggestions from other users are displayed in a list divided into different columns. The list is organized in this example according to Rating Make Model Year Range and Notes and Conditions .

The rating is a number or value based on set criteria. One example would be for users to rate the suggestions based on their level of confidence that the information is correct. For example if an AlsoFits entry has a rating of 10 with 10 being the highest possible rating that would mean that all users who rated the information believe that the information is accurate. If the rating received a lower value it would indicate to the seller that some users do not agree with this information or think differently. For the purposes of this document rating is shown only as another embodiment of the system described herein.

If the seller wants to view more information about a particular AlsoFits suggestion or its rating they would click the individual suggestion from the AlsoFits suggestion list to display supplementary details that lists all of the threads or comments attached to the AlsoFits suggestion for the seller to review. For example in the seller would see that thread states that user Jackson21 added that a 2006 to 2007 Chevrolet Cobolt with specific conditions shown in the Figure would also fit the seller s 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt meaning that the item he is selling is considered the same as one found on a 2006 07 Chevrolet Cobalt providing the conditions specified in the Notes and Conditions are the same . He would also see in thread that user racer55 agreed with Jackson21 and added his own comments.

This is a very powerful way for users to interact and share information about their items parts while allowing these users to apply the information to an item listing. If the seller wants to close the supplementary details they would click the Close link beside the suggestion. If the seller decides to add the AlsoFits suggestion to their listing they would simply click the Add link beside the entry shown in . Once added the information found in the suggestion is added to the data fields as shown in . Once the listing is posted the alsofits compatibility data becomes searchable. shows that the seller s listing will be searchable by the 2007 08 Saturn Aura and 2006 07 Chevrolet Cobalt information. Note that the first two suggestions added to the seller s listing. appear in the data fields . Notice that the add link beside the alsofits suggestions changes from an add link to a remove link indicating to the seller that the suggestion has been added to their listing. If the seller wants to remove a suggestion from their listing they can click the remove link beside the suggestion they wish to remove in the alsofits list or they can click the remove link beside the suggestion they want to remove in the data fields .

In another embodiment the AlsoFits information and tool will also be accessible as a standalone application through the Tool Box link in the main navigation tabs. This allows users to add information into the system without having to sell an item or go through the sell process as described.

The administrator has a tool not shown to review all AlsoFits suggestions to ensure that users abide by the system policies i.e. no profanity information is relevant and not caused by a spam server etc. The AlsoFits.com website owned by the system will utilize the same functionality as described herein for the system .

Further to the alsofits details described above and described in the single item selling process the following will provide more details and examples regarding the ability for a user to add compatibility details to a listing.

The tools in the vehicle details pane allows the seller to enter compatibility details that will match the item they are selling. For example a user may be selling an item that fits all Honda vehicles. In that case the seller can easily type in Honda in the make field . If the seller does not enter any other information such as model year sub model etc. in the data fields the system will know the item will fit all Honda s. For example if the seller only entered Chevrolet in the Make field the seller is specifying that their item will fit all Chevrolet vehicles regardless of model sub model and year range. If the seller adds a make model and sub model but no year then the system will assume that the item will fit all years of the specified make model and sub model.

As mentioned earlier if the seller types in a make that is not found in main category database the entry is still accepted but flagged and sent to the administrator . The administrator can then review the entry and determine if it should be added to the main category database . This adds user generated Web 2.0 functionality to the platform allowing users to help populate the main category database . For example if the seller types Holden in the make field the make will not appear in the Make list since the system does not have the Australian made vehicle in its main category database . The seller is allowed to finish their listing. The administrator is then notified of the new make and conducts a review of the Holden make to ensure it is legitimate and not made up by the seller . The administrator then adds it to the main category database so the next time a user types in Hol in the make field Holden will be available by auto fill tool for selecting in the Make list generated.

Furthermore once a user has entered compatibility data such as a make in this example it becomes searchable. In the example in the seller chose Chevrolet as the make. If a buyer searches for Chevrolet using top search menu the seller s listing would appear in the search results because the word Chevrolet appears in the listing. If the buyers uses the advanced search filters and selects a particular model and year of Chevrolet the listing would again appear in the search results because the seller has specified that their item would fit all Chevrolet vehicles for all years.

The user can enter data for the item model within the model field similar to the function of the make field explained above. It is important to note that the model field can be used independently of the make field . For example if the seller chooses a model from the Model list without entering a make in the Make field first the system may be configured to automatically fill in the make field using the auto fill tool if it found a match in the main category database . For example if the seller entered Cobalt in the model field without entering the make the system would automatically know that the Cobalt make is Chevrolet.

It is important to note that the administrator can change the display of the model and sub model fields by combining them into a single model field for convenience and searching. Some vehicles only use a model name while others have a model and sub model name. For example Saturn Aura is a make and model while Chevrolet C15 Suburban is another make and model Chevrolet C15 with the sub model Suburban attached to it. Most people in the industry would refer to this vehicle as a Suburban not a C15. Combining the two together makes searching better for both the buyer and seller .

The Year Range field allows the seller to further refine their compatibility data by allowing the seller to add a year or year range to their criteria. For example in if the seller added 2008 in the to year field it would mean that the seller is indicating the item will also fit a 2007 to 2008 Chevrolet Cobalt with a 2.4 L engine. If a buyer searches for items for either a 2007 or a 2008 Cobalt the seller s listings would appear because it matches the buyer s search criteria. However if the buyer searched for items for a 2009 Cobalt the listing would not appear because the seller indicated that the item would not fit.

As noted earlier if the make and model names specified by the seller match a vehicle in the main category database the auto fill tool would be able to display the year lists shown in for that make and model. However if the make and model do not match a vehicle in the main category database the years will be unknown and so the from year and to year results lists would not be displayed and the user could enter their own year in the fields . In that case the system would accept the custom year and send it to the administrator to determine if they should be added to the main category database .

There are a variety of other unique features that are part of the system . Although these features can be used in numerous industries for the purposes of this document all examples and explanations will involve the automotive industry.

When a user is selling both an item and or multi item the system provides a question window displaying a list of recommended questions to better describe the item. This is done to help the seller provide all of the important item details to ultimately increase the chances of selling the item by helping the buyer with their purchase decision. The system includes a questions help database with custom question option libraries for auto and truck parts. A question option library is a list of options users can quickly add to their listing usually by using click boxes . illustrate the system providing a list of possible item options the user can select a click box or select from a question option list to add to their listing instead of manually typing them into the description.

Consider the following example. A user is selling an outside rear view mirror for their car. Without the assistance from the system the user posts the item describing it as in great shape since they didn t know what else they should say about the item. A buyer finds the item but is looking for the model with the power option and heated glass. The buyer realizes that the listing says nothing about those options so the buyer does not purchase the item or is forced to contact the seller and wait for a reply. Contacting the seller slows the purchase process as human intervention is required. These questions are designed to reduce the human intervention required to make the sale and works especially well for helping sellers record answers to commonly asked questions. These questions relate to the item the user is selling and have been designed by the administrator . Answering the questions is completely optional. show two examples of questions that the seller can use to post additional details about the item they are selling one for a door mirror and one for a steering column respectively.

Once the seller answers the questions the answers are then made searchable so the buyer can refine their search based on the questions as illustrated in . displays the search results page previously described in . For example a buyer searches in the search results page for a mirror for their vehicle and the system returns over 100 results. To refine their search the buyer uses an advanced search feature as described previously herein. This feature shows the buyer the same questions the sellers were asked when listing the items and allows the buyer to filter their search based on those questions . For example as illustrated in the buyer selects Right Passenger Side from options in the Advanced Search Filters and immediately the results filter to show only listings that contain right mirrors based on the seller s answers. The search is dynamic meaning that the list is automatically updated to reflect the options selected by the user in the advanced search feature pane . If the user clicks Heated Glass option the list refines further to show only heated right side mirrors.

The system has a custom list not shown of keywords for both categories items and vehicles that includes different names for each of them. It is very common in the auto industry to have many different names or short forms that refer to the same part. For example a transmission is commonly referred to as a tranny or an ECM is commonly referred to as a brain box or computer and a Catalytic Converter is called a cat . The system may obtain this name database from research and input from those in the industry. Another example is a Heater Motor which is commonly referred to as a Blower Motor Blower Fan or Heater Fan and the plastic Wheel that pushes the air is known as the Squirrel Cage . Although these examples are very simple the database not shown is used for more than simple name replacements. For example if a user sells an engine wiring harness connector a descriptor for their vehicle the system knows that buyers may search for a pigtail or more specifically an engine pigtail . If a buyer searches for these terms the seller s item engine wiring harness connector would appear in the search results because an engine pigtail is a slang term that relates to a wiring connector.

The same applies to vehicle names. For example a Ford F 150 Pickup Truck is commonly referred to as a Ford Half ton or an F150 notice it does not have a after the F . Another example is a Ford Thunderbird which is usually called a T Bird or TBird . Without this custom database a buyer that searches F150 rims in the top search bar would find no results unless the seller purposely typed in F150 in their listing . With the custom database included in the system when the buyer types F150 in the search bar the system would automatically know to look for all listings with items relating to an F 150 Pickup Truck . Although these are very simple examples this custom list is much more complex. Briefly users commonly look for or sell items that fit multiple vehicles of the same class or series . For example a Mercedes Benz E300 E320 E420 E430 E500 and E550 are all considered to be in the E Class series. Because the system s custom intermediary database knows this a seller using the AlsoFits feature described previously herein can type E Class or EClass or E Class in the model field . This way when a buyer searches for a particular model in any E Class series say an E320 CDI the seller s listing will appear in the search results even though the seller did not specifically choose that particular model.

The third part of this feature is the custom incorrect spelling database see . The system currently has more than 163 000 spelling variations for both categories sub categories descriptors vehicle names etc. This makes it easy for both the buyer and seller because they can make a spelling mistake and the system would still know what they meant. For example if a user types fodr or hiunday the system will know the user actually means Ford or Hyundai .

Everything typed in by users is tracked and monitored by the administrator so that the incorrect spelling database can be constantly updated. If the administrator notices a term not found in their database it can be added. This can be performed manually or through an automated process.

The system has and continuously adds preset pictures for categories items so that when a user sells an item without a picture the user will have the opportunity to use the standard generic picture that resembles their item. For example if a user is selling a fender but does not have a picture of it the seller can use the preset picture prepared by the system . This helps the buyer to identify the item if they don t recognize the name of it. For example many buyers will not know what an EGR is so a picture would help them identify it as the correct item they are looking for. Although items will vary across years and models the pictures will serve a reference point only. The picture database will be custom to the system for categories sub categories descriptors and vehicles. This would also be very useful for sellers that use the bin feature described previously herein to sell their items. Since most sellers creating a bin will not take individual pictures of each item within the bin using a standard picture to display on the front of their bin would be very convenient.

Similar functionality applies to vehicles. The system stores pictures when vehicles are posted to build a detailed picture library see of vehicles that can be filtered down to but not limited to the year make model submodel and trim package. This is subsequently described below. The system may also use some vehicle pictures from the ACES database or third party database so if a seller list a vehicle and does not have a picture of the vehicle they could use a standard photo that resembles the vehicle. For example a seller lists a 1995 Ford Mustang GT but does not have a picture of it. The seller could use a picture from the main category database or the system picture database instead.

An advanced look up tool not shown will utilize the database to create a unique search tool for users allowing them to look up an item and or vehicle from a particular year make and model submodel for reference purposes. For example a buyer is told by his mechanic that he needs an EGR for his 1990 Volkswagen Jetta. The buyer has no idea what it looks like or what it is so he can use this tool on the system to search for the item. The system will search its library for both current and past listings for a 1990 Volkswagen Jetta EGR . Once found the buyer could review the different pictures from current and past sellers to show the buyer what the EGR looks like. As well the system can add a short description beside the pictures explaining what the item is and what it does. This is an extremely powerful tool for anyone in the automotive industry. In yet another example if a user does not know what a 1985 Ford Mustang GT looks like they can use this tool in the system to view the car. The system would search pictures and video files from all current and previous listings to find a match.

If a seller chooses the Contact Seller shipping method not shown he receives shipping requests from buyers for the item he is selling. For example choosing Contact Seller for the Canada region the item would appear in the listing with no shipping price as shown in . illustrates one example of what buyers would see when they view an item s details. In another embodiment the message center can allow the buyer to request a shipping quote from the seller . Once the seller receives the shipping quote from the buyer he could enter the shipping information into a request form not shown similar to that shown in for the flat fee shipping method shown by numerals and . The seller can see the country city province state and postal zip code to calculate the shipping price. Once the seller finishes and sends the quote to the buyer the buyer will then have total item price shipping and item price combined . A Buy This Item link not shown will be found in the message so the buyer could purchase the item from that message. When the buyer clicks it the purchase confirmation page not shown is updated to show the total price and the buyer is then able to complete the purchase. The message centre therefore allows buyers and sellers to purchase and sell parts through messages. It may be noted that the messages can be configured to keep the buying and selling process within the system to make sure that users do not circumvent the system . In this case emails can be sent to the user but they are brought back to the system such that responses are made within the system .

Sellers can use these features with all messages. For example a buyer contacts the seller and asks an item related question along with a shipping question such as Do you still have this item available Can you ship overnight Regardless of whether the seller had shipping details attached to the listing or not they can respond with another shipping quotation similar to the Contact Shipping example explained above. In this example the seller had posted the item with a flat shipping price of 5.00 via UPS Ground. The seller can respond to the buyers message and click the Add Shipping Quote link in the message not shown to send a custom quotation to the buyer for overnight shipping. The seller can then add another shipping option UPS Next Day Air for 25.00 and send it to the buyer . When the buyer receives the message they can purchase the item from the message with either the UPS Ground 5.00 shipping or choose the UPS Next Day Air 25.00 option. It can be seen that sellers have many options when communicating with sellers . The system is designed to be flexible and allow the seller to operate as they would in their bricks and mortar business.

Another embodiment of this feature allows a seller to find an item he is selling and create a manual shipping quote to send to a buyer . For example Seller A receives a phone call from a buyer asking if he has Product A available. The seller does have it and although the seller did not receive a shipping quote or message through the system from the buyer the seller is able to view his Product A listing and a Send Quote link not shown would appear only visible to the seller as that is his listing. Clicking that link would allow the seller to enter details about a shipping price review the item price and send it to a buyer s email. When the buyer receives this email they are able to purchase the item from the quote message through the system . In this way seller s can send buyer s quotations directly attached to their listings on the system without waiting for buyer s to contact them. This is very convenient when seller s receive phone calls or email messages from outside the system for items the seller is selling on the system . Sellers can quickly send a quote and let the buyer purchase the item through the system . Another embodiment of this feature allows the seller to create a quote for an item they do not have listed on the system by allowing them to quickly list it. For example Seller A is contacted by a buyer who is looking for Product B. Although the seller has the item available in his bricks and mortar store it is not listed on the system . The seller can then can quickly create a listing on the system for Product B and send the buyer a quote with the item price and shipping to the buyer s email. They buyer can them purchase the item through the system .

Although the system uses the ACES vehicle database for vehicle information the system has their own custom intermediary database not shown . To reiterate the ACES database provides vehicle information such as make model and sub model names and years for vehicles marketed in North America. However ACES may not include vehicle information from other markets such as Australia China and the United Kingdom. The system is building a master vehicle database not shown that includes vehicles from all over the world. Using the AlsoFits tool as described previously herein if sellers add vehicles to their listing that are not found in the main category database the system accepts the vehicles and reviews them. The administrator will then research each vehicle to determine that it is a legitimate vehicle and then adds it to the custom database so other users can find it later in the auto fill tool . For example a seller lists an item for a 2008 Holden Barina an Australian vehicle not found in the ACES database . The system allows the seller to complete the listing and the administrator is informed of the new model. The administrator then reviews the 2008 Holden Barina and decides to add it to the main category database . The next time a buyer or seller uses the auto fill tool to lookup a vehicle the 2008 Holden Barina would be appear. This allows the system to let the users help populate the main database .

The Damage Designer feature allows the seller to highlight specific areas of an item within a picture and assign a damage type and or comment to the buyer . For example a user lists a fender with a few dents in it however due to the glossy paint finish and the camera flash the dents do not appear in the picture. This is a common problem in the auto industry. The Damage Designer was created to allow the seller to clearly indicate where a part has been damaged.

Currently a standard has been developed by the Automotive Recyclers Association ARA which lists 14 different damage types to describe items including burn dent bent hail rip or crack buckle lip parking lot dings etc and developing damage codes. The ARA Damage Description Codes are three characters long representing the location damage and units of damage to the part. For example 2D1 represents a one unit dent in location 2. There may be a primary and secondary code for each part as in 2D1 4S2. If there is no damage on a part the code is 000. Although this method is supposed to be the standard in the used auto parts industry converting an item s damage and or condition into codes makes it very difficult for a buyer to understand where it is damaged. The buyer would have to spend time looking at a legend as illustrated in to understand what the codes mean. Furthermore the codes only give general areas of damage and do not give the buyer the exact location on the part. For example look at the first Front Clip item in the legend the damage area 2 is for the entire hood. The buyer would not know where the damage on the hood is using the ARA Damage Codes.

Therefore the Damage Designer feature allows users to quickly highlight damaged or imperfect referred to herein as damaged areas by allowing the user to outline the exact damaged area proportional to the image. For example shows an embodiment of the Damage Designer page after the seller clicked the Use Damage Designer link from the photos tab pane displayed in . A picture of a red glossy fender a seller is posting has been uploaded. The picture clearly illustrates where the damage is on the fender because of the dark black marks and on the picture and how extensive the damage is by the size of the outline proportional to the picture. The smaller circles reflect smaller damaged areas. The user has many drawing tools available such as but not limited to a rectangle tool to draw a rectangular box a circle tool to draw a circle and a free form tool to draw a custom outline around the exact damaged areas. The user can change the colour and thickness of the lines so they stand out against different coloured pictures .

The Damage Designer feature is integrated into all of the selling and photo upload features. Once the photo is uploaded the seller only has to click the Use Damage Designer button not shown to open the tool. This tool can also be used to highlight anything in a picture the seller wants to show buyers . For example one user selling a performance engine may want to emphasize and point out a special feature of the item. The user could highlight this special feature in the picture choose a special option from the damage types menu and add a comment such as This is the performance distributor that will increase your performance by 15 . This is a great way for sellers to emphasize special items in their pictures. The example given herein is specific to the use of auto parts however the use of this tool can extend to a variety of other applications.

The repair quote and service tendering system allows buyers to request repair quotes and or quotes for any type of service related to the system from sellers service providers who registered to receive these quotes. Service providers include but are not limited to body shops mechanical repair shops tire shops custom detailers fabrication shops etc. For example a buyer may wish to send out a request to determine the price to get his car repainted. Another user may want to send out a request to all custom designers to create a head rest.

The method of the feature is that the seller would register for an account on the system and configure their account by choosing which notifications from buyers they wish to receive. The seller service provider would be presented with a list of notifications based on the type of account they registered with. For example if a seller registers as a body shop the settings for the account would pertain to body shop services such as Receive requests for paint jobs Receive requests for body work etc. If the seller registered as a mechanic the notifications would pertain to mechanic services such as Receive requests for tune ups or Receive requests for engine installations . Other advanced settings allow the seller to filter their notifications. For example a seller service provider may only want to receive requests from buyers within 10 kilometres from their business. Once the service provider has configured their account they are ready to accept service quotes and tenders. These configuration settings are determined and created by the system .

Next a buyer could submit a service request to all sellers who have subscribed to receive the notifications requesting the price for service how long it would it take etc. The request appears in the seller s inbox see in their message centre and they receive an email notification not shown directing them to their inbox . The request lists information such as but not limited to user id of buyer date and time comments buyer vehicle information year make model sub model and any pictures and or video the buyer attached to the request. As example of a comment in a request may be How much would it cost to repaint my car 

The seller then reviews the requests and uses the pictures and or video to help them determine the quote. It is extremely difficult to price out a service through pictures as the buyer may not have included all of the pertinent information so the seller does not respond with a fixed price. Instead they send the buyer a price range. For example the seller would respond to the buyer by saying To repaint your car the price would be between 500.00 and 600.00 dollars for paint and labour. The seller would respond to the request in a standard response form similar to the parts car seller response form shown in . The seller could include more estimates for different services. For example the seller may say If you want to change the colour the price range would increase to 650.00 to 750.00. The seller responds directly from the request in their inbox .

Once the seller sends the quote to the buyer the request is organized into folders in the buyers My Account not shown making it easy to manage and keep track of all of their quotes. For example one folder may be named by the buyer as Quote to paint car while another may be named Quote to fix the squeaky brakes . Another example would be for the buyers to create folders based on the different vehicles they are sending the requests for e.g. Fix the 98 Caravan or Paint the Tahoe etc . The buyer could then review the request research the seller by viewing their system profile and feedback and then make the decision of who to use. Or at the very least the buyer could narrow down their choices to two or three sellers and then visit them in person outside the system .

The service will also be accessible from both the search results page not shown and through the Tool Box tab . When a buyer searches for an item that is related to a service the system provides the buyer with a list of sellers or service providers the buyer may be interested in located at the bottom of the search results. For example a buyer searches for a hood for his vehicle and finds one that they want to buy. The system gives the buyer a list of body shop sellers service providers close to the buyer s location. That way if the buyer is looking for someone to install the item they are about to purchase they can find both the item and service facility to install it through the system . The buyer can then click on a seller service provider to view their profile that includes video pictures and the description of their facility etc.

The buyer can also send requests directly from the Tool Box so they don t have to search for an item to find a list of service providers but rather search for one by service type. For example a buyer may search for all custom designers to make a special item for their car or search for a transmission repair shop located in the Toronto area that specializes in BMW transmissions. The page would be similar to the Search Suppliers page shown in . The buyer has access to advanced filters similar to that of the seller . In this case the buyer only wants to find sellers within 100 kilometres of his house. The buyer would then send his request to the service provider . The system matches the service providers to the main category database to associate their services with descriptors categories sub categories vehicle make models and years etc.

Similar to the tendering system a user may search specifically for a supplier using the sourcing tool. Suppliers as described in the Part a Log tool above can setup detailed profiles and allow sellers to subscribe to their item catalogues. The sourcing tool can be used to perform detailed searches and find suppliers for specific items. For example a seller may want to find a supplier that sells parts for automatic transmissions broad supplier search or they may want to find a supplier that specifically sells rubber body mounts for Ford Trucks. Having such a sourcing tool gives the seller the ability to locate suppliers they may want to do business with. Once they are interested in a supplier they can view the supplier s detailed profile company videos brochures background information etc. .

The Auto Part It tool is a further embodiment to the List a Multi Item option see as described herein and illustrated in . However when the seller reaches the Choose Parts tab they choose the items they wish to create individual listings for and then the Auto Part It tool creates individual listings for each of those items. To reiterate using an auto parts example the Multi Item listing makes one entry for the complete vehicle so that buyers can request parts from that single listing. In this embodiment the system would use its Auto Part It tool to create separate entries for every item the user selected in the Choose Parts tab in addition to creating a vehicle multi item listing.

The main difference between the Auto Part It tool and the List Multi Item tool is that the user may be required to add a price to each item. The system may be configured to allow the seller to add the items without adding a price and allowing buyers to request the shipping and item price for the items. The system can also auto generate the headline for each of the items so the seller doesn t have to manually type it for every one of their items thus reducing the time required to make an entry. The auto generated headline is very convenient as it takes the year make model and the selected item descriptor to create the headline a required field. If the seller wants to change the headline they can do so at any time. shows one example of the modified choose parts tab shown herein in and like elements are given like numerals with the suffix for clarity. Each item in the tree in this example has a listing for its price a description and an auto generated headline . If an item descriptor in the tree structure has questions from the questions database attached to it a Q will appear at the end of the listing beside the Add more details link . Selecting this link will open the questions window not shown to show questions similar to those illustrated in related to that item so the seller can add more details to the item listing.

When the seller is finished choosing their items they are presented with a summary page shown in . The summary page shows the seller the total number of part listings that will be generated from the multi item listing and shows the total fees if fees apply for the listing the potential sales revenue if they sold all of the items which represents the sum of all item prices and the total revenue if all parts sold . This is calculated by taking the vehicle cost as entered in the required details pane and subtracting it from the total revenues .

Clicking the Finish button would create individual listings for all of the items parts the seller chose to list from the choose parts tab . The individual listed parts would appear in the Parts tab shown in in the search results page and the multi item listing would appear in this example in the Parts Vehicles tab shown in . Buyers can still send parts request to the seller even if they used the Auto Part It feature. A link not shown to the part car listing would appear in every item listing from that vehicle. For example if a user viewed the individual hood listing created by the system they could click the View Parts Car button not shown to take them directly to the parts car multi item listing.

The benefit of using the Auto Part It tool would be to let the system generate individual listings from a single multi item . For example from one vehicle the system can generate in this example over 1 700 individual listings. The administrator has a database containing a list of items descriptors as they relate to multi items . For example the database contains a list of different parts found on cars trucks vans SUV s etc. so the system knows what to generate. Consider this example Seller A lists a truck and uses the Auto Part It feature. The system then creates individual part listings for all parts on that truck right fender left fender right headlight left headlight engine transmission truck box truck cab etc. using the main category database descriptors positions etc. explained earlier. If the seller wanted to create individual listings for all the parts on that vehicle it would take him days to create listings for the thousands of parts on that vehicle. The Auto Part It tool makes it quick and simple. The system would know that different parts are available on different vehicle types cars trucks etc. vehicle makes Ford Chevrolet etc. vehicle years e.g. air bags are not available on vehicles in the 1950 s etc.

The system can use and or integrate with third party databases to assist in creating the individual item listings. For example if a the system offers the Auto Part It tool for heavy equipment machine such as backhoes bull dozers etc. the system may integrate databases with known parts for those machines so that the system can properly create the individual listings.

As mentioned earlier the Auto Part It is an additional feature that can be added as a further embodiment to the List a Multi Item option to offer a different service based on the needs and wants of the seller .

When users list a Parts Vehicle and specify they are willing to sell the complete vehicle or its parts an option the seller chooses when listing their parts vehicle the vehicle listings become available on websites related to the system as a value added benefit of using the system . These other websites are similar to the system however they can include other applications such as forestry equipment mining equipment construction equipment cars and trucks and more. If the vehicle is sold through the system or any of the other system s sites the listing is taken down from all sites. All three sites will share similar functionality to the system as fully described herein.

The system includes a detailed knowledge based video and blogging platform not shown specific to the niche parts industry. This tool will allow users to share their knowledge on an international platform. For example users can watch how to videos on how to change their oil repair dents or remove and replace parts. The videos will feature both professional and non professional videos so users can watch how the experts do things. Organizations such as the Collision Repair Association of America can feature their own training videos for their registered members or a user can post a question about a car problem they cannot fix to receive advice from other users. Users can link these videos and or blogs to a category item and or make model and year for searching purposes. For example a buyer searches for a heater motor for their 2000 Dodge Neon. In the search results page there will be a link not shown to the knowledge base tool if there are entries related to that item. In this example the user clicks the link to read about problems other users encountered with the heater motor.

This is a unique search method that will appeal to users who cannot find their parts listed on the system and do not want to continuously check to see if they become available. A user will search for an item and if no item is found they will have the option of posting it to the wanted board not shown by clicking Post to Wanted Board not shown . The wanted board features a page dedicated to items that people are looking for accessible by clicking the Wanted Board tab not shown beside Tool Box in the main menu. The item is then stored in the buyer s My Account using the Parts Alert tool not shown so that if that item becomes available the user will receive an email notifying them that their item is now available with a link to the listing. The system will continue to search for that item until the user removes it from their settings under My Profile.

Sellers can review the Wanted Board to find items they have to sell. For example a buyer looks for a rare tail lamp for his 1948 Chevrolet Truck. The search does not return any results so the item is posted to the Wanted Board and is then stored in the buyer s account using Parts Alert. Later another user decides to sell a 1948 Chevrolet Truck tail lamp and lists it on the system. As soon as this listing becomes active the buyer receives an email from the system providing notification that someone is selling the tail lamp they requested. Three days later another seller reviews the Wanted Board and notices a request for a tail lamp that they have. Clicking on the listing will take the seller into the sell page and pre fills the item information based on the buyer s request. The seller lists his item and the buyer receives a message telling him that a seller responded to his request on the Wanted Board with a link to the listing. This makes it very convenient for buyers and sellers and prevents lost sales for sellers .

An extension of this feature is to allow users to add vehicle profiles to their My Account so that when the user needs to find parts for that vehicle they can go to it in My Account and the system would automatically pull in all parts and parts cars listed on the system including from the Part a Log as described previously herein for that vehicle and organize them into first tier categories similar to the way items are organized in a seller s Store Front as described previously herein. This allows for the buyer to find all items and parts cars available for their vehicle rather than having to search for items or parts cars.

Using the searching tools in the Buy and Sell tabs allows the users to find items or vehicles very easily by offering a wide array of lookup combinations. Users can type in these different combinations to find the vehicles dynamically in the auto fill list . For example if a user types de the list will display all makes models and sub models that begin with de . If the user types the list filters to show only vehicles available in 1984. If the user types in 84 Mustang the system will automatically choose a 1984 Ford Mustang even though the user only selected the partial year 84 and the model. This is one example of a user s search parameters however there are many more complex combinations that the system can use to find a user s desired vehicle and or items from a particular vehicle.

The year field accepts 1 2 and 4 characters. For example typing 84 pulls up all vehicles made in 1884 and 1984 and typing 1984 pulls up all vehicles made in the 1984.

Another feature that allows users from all over the world to race each other using satellite and GPS tracking is the Watch Us race tool. For example a user creates and posts his vehicle profile outlining the type of vehicle he has e.g. Honda Civic its engine size and other vehicle specific details etc. Then using his mobile phone with internet and GPS tracking enabled or using a GPS device or using his notebook computer with an available wireless signal to allow him to connect to the internet and a GPS unit he logs into the system s sister website. Once connected he races on any road or terrain and the satellite tracks his course and speed. Then his time and course layout gets posted on the system s sister website beside his vehicle profile. Other users from anywhere in the world can then create their own vehicle profile and race the user to beat his time on a similar course i.e. straight road . The user can choose to receive email notifications if other users beat his time. The user can setup the race again directly from that email. Further options will organize the racers into different groups and classes based on such criteria as vehicle type country province state etc. This can also be used with both motorized and non motorized vehicles or methods of transportation.

As described above A Product Advertising option can be selected from the main sell menu as shown in to allow sellers or administrators of other websites or systems to integrate and or promote their item listings from their website into the items database and the system . For example ABC Company may have their own website but may want to use the intermediary to promote their items and generate more sales by listing all of their items in the intermediary s items database . The system can be configured to generate revenue from sending referrals from the intermediary to the seller s own website or store and or charge a commission fee for sales generated from buyers who found the seller s item on the items database and purchased the item from the seller on the seller s own website.

This tool allows other part sellers and websites to integrate with the system . What makes this tool very different is that the system organizes the all of the integrated data into the categorization database making the data searchable using the system s extensive search tools. The result is that the system becomes the one central portal to the items databases and item catalogues and integrates buyers sellers and supplier into an e commence platform. Furthermore the system allows sellers and suppliers to utilize the system s selling tools to list and sell their items within the system or sell their items on their own e commerce systems using the Product Advertising tool giving them unparalleled flexibility in how they want to do business.
