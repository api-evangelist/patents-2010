This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 154 572 filed Feb. 23 2009 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Certain portions of this invention were made under U.S. Department of the Air Force Contact No. FA8103 07 C 0008. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates in general to x ray diffraction XRD techniques and analyzers. More particularly this invention relates to an improved x ray diffraction technique and analyzer for analyzing grain orientation in multiple grain materials e.g. directionally solidified alloys used in turbine blades.

Directionally solidified DS nickel superalloys are commonly used in turbine blades for high temperature aircraft and space propulsion engines and land based high efficiency power generating plants. Casting of these parts does not always result in perfect crystal grain orientation which is critical for performance under high temperature conditions. Engine failures including aircraft mishaps have heightened the emphasis on efficient and direct measurement of grain orientation in turbine blades.

Conventional chemical etching visual inspection and or laboratory based x ray analysis techniques based on Laue Diffraction are unsuitable and or cost prohibitive for quality control of an entire turbine blade. As one example conventional X ray Laue Diffraction XRD can be used to determine single crystal grain orientation. The conventional approach uses an X ray area detector to collect an XRD Laue pattern produced by an X ray beam incident on a sample and determining the grain orientation by processing this collected Laue pattern. However certain problems exist when using the Laue method to determine grain orientation for DS blades. DS blades may consist of several single crystal grains. Therefore the diffraction pattern is usually generated from multiple grains and the images become complex and difficult to analyze.

What is required therefore are improved techniques for measurement of grain orientation of multiple grain samples.

The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided the present invention which in one aspect is an x ray diffraction apparatus for measuring crystal orientation of a multiple grain sample. An x ray excitation path is provided having a focusing optic for collecting x rays from an x ray source and redirecting the collected x rays into an x ray beam converging on a single grain of the multiple grain sample. A point detector and the sample are rotated relative to each other and the grain orientation is obtained based upon diffraction patterns collected from first and second grain crystal planes within the apparatus.

A second point detector may also be provided wherein the first point detector collects a diffraction pattern from the first crystal plane and the second point detector collects a diffraction pattern from the second crystal plane.

The sample may be placed upon a rotation stage to facilitate collection of diffraction patterns from the first and second crystal planes by the first point detector and or the detector s may be mounted on rotation stage s to facilitate collection of diffraction patterns from the first and second crystal planes by the detector s .

In one embodiment the focusing optic comprises a polycapillary optic having an output focused beam spot size of about 300 m or smaller which can effectively excite a single grain of multiple grain turbine blade sample.

Further additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.

Disclosed herein is a compact low power focusing beam x ray diffraction technique and associated analyzer that can directly and nondestructively measure each individual grain orientation in a sample having multiple grains in e.g. a DS turbine blade. The analyzer is especially suitable for use in factory production lines or in the field. The technique is enabled by proprietary focusing x ray optics and a highly stable and reliable low power X Beam system coupled with a novel approach to determine grain orientation by diffraction beam directions from selected crystal planes.

This exemplary analyzer includes for example a focusing optic for excitation and a point detector to rapidly determine grain orientation and e.g. whether the grain orientation is acceptable or not. The focusing optic s output focused beam spot size can be e.g. 300 m or smaller e.g. small enough to scan individual grains. The range of spot sizes contemplated by this invention is several mm to as small as 200 m. Such optics include for example curved crystal monochromating optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 285 506 6 317 483 and 7 035 374 and or multilayer optics and or polycapillary optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 192 869 5 175 755 5 497 008 5 745 547 5 570 408 and 5 604 353. Optic source combinations such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 110 506 7 209 545 and 7 257 193 are also useable which disclose lower cost electron bombardment tubes coupled to an optic. Each of the above noted patents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This new approach enables measurement of one single grain at a time on DS blades. Therefore the problems that plague the Laue technique when used for multiple grain samples do not occur.

In accordance with the present invention and with reference to the polyhedron schematic of an exemplary sample crystal structure in if for example both 002 and 022 plane orientations are determined then the grain growth orientation 100 can also be determined in accordance with the present invention. To effect these measurements a sample is rotated so that each grain can be measured in a way to meet the Bragg diffraction condition. For example the 002 plane and the 022 plane diffraction beam direction for the grain orientation determination can be measured. The angular alignment position for 002 plane and 022 plane diffraction combined with the diffraction beam direction comprise inputs for the grain orientation calculation.

In one exemplary system design the point detectors are mounted at the 2 angles of 81 and 133 . These are the angular 2 positions for 002 plane and 022 plane diffraction. A sample is mounted on a rotational scanning base for the diffraction peak search and the data collected for each individual grain.

Obtaining turbine grain orientation using one or more point detectors is discussed below using a NaI point detector. This detector has large capture area up to 2 inches in diameter high sensitivity high counting rate low energy resolution and low cost. Two diffraction spots for each of four blades were chosen and tested. show typical diffraction peak search rotation scan X and peak vertical position scan Y intensity curves. Table 1 shows the calculated values for mis oriented grains of four selected turbine blades. The spot is a location on the turbine blade near the physical transition from the exposed blade to the exposed platform surface. Blade is shown in the photograph of with a mis oriented crystal.

Table 1 shows that blade spot and blade spot have the largest mis orientation angles. This was also confirmed from a visual inspection i.e. both turbine blade number spot and turbine blade number spot had visible signs of mis orientation.

In practice DS turbine blades can have complicated crystal structure and grain orientation distributions. These blades may not have a high crystal quality the grain size is limited and there may be a large mosaic spread. Taken together these characteristics confirm what is described herein that turbine blade diffraction patterns are not similar to silicon wafer diffraction spots. As an example compare diffraction spots obtained from a turbine blade a and a silicon wafer b .

The XRD measurements disclosed herein can provide important crystal structure information about turbine blade samples. Two important conclusions were made. First it was concluded that the DS blades have Ni based cubic FCC structure instead of NiAl. Second it was concluded that the diffraction spots may originate only from 002 111 and 022 crystal planes using Cr K x ray excitation.

Simulation results can be compared to results obtained using the analyzer disclosed herein to validate this technique of measuring grain mis orientation in turbine blades. For example show two diffraction images shows a diffraction pattern obtained using the XRD system disclosed herein and shows a diffraction pattern obtained from simulation.

The residual difference between the real experimental data and the simulation pattern arises from the poor crystal quality of the DS turbine blade grain and the irregular grain shape. However because the primary objective is to determine the grain orientation this simulation pattern can provide enough information for this purpose.

Further analysis using such simulations are possible to validate the corresponding analyzer configurations all of which fall within the scope of the present invention. For example and with reference to a detector may be rotated along a perpendicular axis through the sample measurement point. Its height can also be adjusted. It was assumed the incident focusing spot hit right on the turbine blade measurement position.

The system can be defined by orthogonal X Y and Z axes and and rotation axes for angular alignment of the turbine blade crystal as shown in . The initial angular position for the crystal is 0 0.

A systematic simulation measurement validated XRD patterns for directionally solidified DS turbine blades according to the techniques disclosed herein. First a series of simulation patterns can be generated with sample crystal angular misalignments. Both the diffraction intensity and the diffraction spot angular position changes according to the crystal misalignment. However it is not a simple issue to directly use these changes to locate the crystal orientation. In this case was directly correspondent to the incident angle and was kept equal to 0 so the diffraction spot intensity and angular position would change to meet the Bragg conditions whenever the crystal angular position is changed. The angular offsets were 0 2 3 4 and 5 for the following simulation patterns and shows these simulation images.

Another important analysis involves analyzing diffraction angular position changes with the angle which can be used as an indicator of turbine blade grain mis orientation. From geometrical analysis it can be assumed that changes do not vary position on the detector for the 002 diffraction spot however it should have impact on both 022 and 111 diffraction spots. In simulation images are shown for the 002 plane with different angles.

As can be seen from there is no visible change in diffraction from the 002 diffraction plane by varying the angle.

In simulation patterns are shown for the 022 plane with different angles. The diffraction spot for the 022 plane changes its height by increasing the angle offset.

A new data collection and processing procedure is also disclosed in accordance with the present invention. One significant aspect of this approach is that only angular scans are performed for the turbine blade sample diffraction alignment as shown in . This is based on the analysis of a series of XRD diffraction patterns which show that for most turbine blade samples angular scans for searching diffraction spots can be avoided. Based on the analysis a new procedure has been developed for the orientation measurements 

As shown above 8 parameters are required for the orientation calculation. The mathematic formulas to calculate the grain orientation are as follows 

A series of experimental data was obtained from a turbine blade having grain mis orientations. The raw data and orientation calculations are shown in Table 2.

Based on this analysis a fixed point detector approach is disclosed. Two detectors may be set at fixed angular positions corresponding to the 002 and 022 diffraction angular positions. The X value of the diffraction spots will be deduced from Y values and other pre set parameters and the Y value of the diffraction spots can be obtained by a slit scanning apparatus.

In this approach an exemplary NaI detector can be set at either 002 2 81 position or 022 2 133 position adjusted through a rotational scanning mechanism. For the turbine blade initial scanning the detector will be set as close as possible to the sample with its full active area for the maximum capture solid angle. After the diffraction spots are located a detector cap with a 2 5 mm horizontal slit can be added to the detector head and the detector can be scanned vertically to locate the diffraction profile maximum Y positions which have the major impact to the grain orientation vector. The turbine blade sample will only have an a angular scan and only the and the Y positions for the two diffraction spots will be combined with other preset parameters or deduced values to calculate the grain orientation in the turbine based coordinate system. illustrates an embodiment of a fixed detector prototype system for turbine blade grain orientation measurement in accordance with this aspect of the present invention.
