This application is a U.S. 371 national phase entry of International Patent Application No. PCT US2010 050893 international filing date Sep. 30 2010 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 256 699 filed Oct. 30 2009 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with government support under contract number R01 CA119409 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to dendrimer synthesis. Specifically the present invention relates to triazine compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of click chemistry for use in one step synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of use of the same.

Cancer remains the number two cause of mortality in the United States resulting in over 500 000 deaths per year. Despite advances in detection and treatment cancer mortality remains high. New compositions and methods for the imaging and treatment e.g. therapeutic of cancer may help to reduce the rate of mortality associated with cancer.

Severe chronic pain is observed on a variety of subjects. For example there exist large numbers of individuals with severe pain associated with arthritis autoimmune disease injury cancer and a host of other conditions.

There exists a need for compositions methods and systems for delivering agents e.g. diagnostic and or therapeutic e.g. cancer therapeutics pain relief agents to subjects that provide effective therapy e.g. disease treatment symptom relief etc. with reduced or eliminated side effects even when administered in high doses. Functionalized dendrimers such as PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with functional ligands relevant to cancer therapy and or pain alleviation have been developed for such purposes. However multi step conjugation strategies used to attach different functional groups to the surfaces of nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers PAMAM dendrimer branches introduce higher polydispersity and require multiple processing steps thereby complicating synthesis. In addition increased polydispersity of functionalized dendrimer products can negatively affect properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting.

Improved methods of synthesis of dendrimers resulting in decreased polydispersity are needed. In particular compositions and methods that facilitate one step click chemistry for use in synthesis of functionalized dendrimers are needed.

The present invention relates to dendrimer synthesis. Specifically the present invention relates to triazine compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of click chemistry for use in one step synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of synthesizing and using the same.

Functionalized dendrimers such as PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with functional ligands e.g. therapeutic agents triggering agents imaging agents targeting agents have many therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However multi step conjugation strategies used to attach different functional ligands to the surfaces of nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers PAMAM dendrimer branches introduce higher polydispersity and require multiple processing steps thereby complicating synthesis and negatively affecting properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting.

For example multifunctional cancer therapeutics have been developed based on Generation 5 PAMAM dendrimers G5 see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 Zhang Y. H. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 2010 21 489 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The targeting molecule folic acid FA and the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate MTX were conjugated sequentially through amide and ester linkages respectively see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Although this device was shown to bind and selectively kill KB tumor cells that over express folate receptor FR in vitro and in vivo see e.g. Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 each herein incorporated by reference in its entireties the multi step conjugation strategy that was employed resulted in a mixture of dendrimer populations having varying distributions of the targeting ligands FA and MTX . The resulting polydispersity was more severe and problematic during large scale synthesis of the conjugate which hindered attempts to move into clinical trials. This was because for example the polydisperisty of the functionalized dendrimer based therapeutics likely negatively affected properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics and effectiveness for multivalent targeting see e.g. Gillies E. R. et al. Drug Discov Today 2005 10 35 herein incorporated by reference its entirety . Moreover multi step conjugations make batch to batch reproducibility extremely challenging as the characterization required after each step becomes progressively more difficult see e.g. Mullen D. G. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 2008 19 1748 Mullen D. G. Acs Nano 2010 4 657 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The present invention overcomes such issues and provides improved methods for the synthesis of well defined multifunctional dendrimers.

It has been previously shown that modifications to the side chains of the glutamic acid moiety on both FA and MTX can be made without loss of activity see e.g. Rosowsky A. et al. J Med Chem 1981 24 1450 Wang S. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 1996 7 56 each incorporated by reference in their entireties . The simplest approach for coupling FA or MTX to a PAMAM dendrimer is through non selective activation of the carboxyl groups of the glutamic acid moiety by carbodiimide see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Unfortunately this method leads to the formation of two structural isomers in which FA and MTX are linked through either the or carboxyl group. It has been reported that FA linked via carboxyl group retains a stronger affinity toward its receptor see e.g. Wang S. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 1996 7 56 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . It also has been shown that a free carboxyl group is essential for retaining MTX s binding to target enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase DHFR whereas chemical modifications of the carboxyl group are much better tolerated see e.g. Wells X. E. et al. Drug Develop Res 1999 46 302 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In addition the availability of multiple amino functional groups on the dendrimer surface allows for the nonspecific reaction with the and carboxyl groups of MTX and FA leading to the formation of inactive conjugates where both carboxyl groups have been coupled. Furthermore dendrimer dimers can form with MTX and or FA serving as a covalent bridge. Therefore precise control of these coupling reactions is necessary to preserve the therapeutic activity of the conjugate.

The present invention utilizes for example triazine scaffolds e.g. trivalent reagent 2 4 6 trichloro 1 3 5 triazines as a core scaffold to give access to multifunctional architectures thereby enabling replacing several chemical entities with a single molecule. Indeed experiments conducted during the course of developing some embodiments of the present invention determined that multivalent triazine compounds e.g. triazine scaffolds find use in one step e.g. click chemistry synthesis of functionalized dendrimers. Moreover experiments conducted during the course of developing some embodiments of the present invention demonstrated that such derivatives e.g. triazine derivatives incorporating the targeting moiety FA and therapeutic drug MTX conjugated to PAMAM dendrimers through click chemistry demonstrated an in vitro dose dependent cytotoxicity with higher cytotoxic potential vs. a similar conjugate synthesized by a multi step approach see e.g. and Example III .

The present invention is not limited to particular triazine compounds e.g. triazine scaffolds . In some embodiments the triazine scaffolds comprise a ring structure e.g. comprising three nitrogen atoms . The triazine scaffolds are not limited to a particular type or kind of triazine ring structure. In some embodiments the ring structure is six membered e.g. the molecular formula comprises CHN . In some embodiments the ring is a conjugated system. For example triazine moieties with six membered rings may have nitrogen atoms at any possible placement so long as three nitrogen atoms occur in the ring e.g. 1 2 3 triazine 1 2 4 triazine 1 3 5 triazine 1 2 5 triazine 1 2 6 triazine etc. . Examples of triazine scaffolds include but are not limited to 

In experiments conducted during the development of embodiments for the present invention trivalent triazine small molecules were used as a core scaffold on which two sites were used for binding e.g. conjugation to functional ligands and a third site was used for conjugation to an azide linker. It was determined that the linker itself can be functionalized e.g. 3 azido coumarine finds use as an imaging agent . The elaborated triazine scaffold was then used for one step click chemistry reaction with an alkyne modified PAMAM dendrimer resulting in a functionalized dendrimer e.g. nanodevice . It was determined that the azide containing linker e.g. 3 azido coumarine is fluorescence silent prior to the click chemistry reaction and fluoresces after conjugation to the alkyne modified PAMAM dendrimer thereby providing a means to monitor dendrimer modification. Moreover one step reaction of dendrimer e.g. modified dendrimers modified dendrimer terminal branches with a multivalent triazine scaffold resulted in decreased polydispersity of the final functionalized nanodevice product.

The present invention is not limited to utilizing a particular type or form of dendrimer. Indeed examples of dendrimers finding use in the present invention include but are not limited to PAMAM dendrimer a Baker Huang PAMAM dendrimer see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 251 244 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety a polypropylamine POPAM dendrimer and a PAMAM POPAM dendrimer. The type of dendrimer used is not limited by the generation number of the dendrimer. Dendrimer molecules may be generation 0 generation 1 generation 2 generation 3 generation 4 generation 5 generation 6 generation 7 or higher than generation 7. In some embodiments half generation dendrimers may be used. In certain embodiments a generation 5 amine terminated PAMAM dendrimer is used. In certain embodiments a generation 5 alkyne terminated PAMAM dendrimer is used. In some embodiments the dendrimer is at least partially acetylated.

Dendrimers are not limited by their method of synthesis. The dendrimer may be synthesized by divergent synthesis methods or convergent synthesis methods. In certain embodiments of the present invention dendrimer molecules may be modified. Modifications may include but are not limited to the addition of amine blocking groups e.g. acetyl groups ligands functional groups conjugates and or linkers not originally present on the dendrimer. Modification may be partial or complete. In some embodiments all of the termini of the dendrimer molecules are modified. In some embodiments not all of the dendrimer molecules are modified.

There may be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more different types of ligands attached to a dendrimer molecule.

In some embodiments conjugation between a ligand and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction click chemistry . Click chemistry involves for example the coupling of two different moieties e.g. a therapeutic agent and a functional group e.g. a first functional group and a second functional group via a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne moiety or equivalent thereof on the surface of the first moeity and an azide moiety or equivalent thereof or any active end group such as for example a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. on the second moiety. Click chemistry is an attractive coupling method because for example it can be performed with a wide variety of solvent conditions including aqueous environments. For example the stable triazole ring that results from coupling the alkyne with the azide is frequently achieved at quantitative yields and is considered to be biologically inert see e.g. Rostovtsev V. V. et al. Angewandte Chemie International Edition 2002 41 14 2596 Wu P. et al.

Sci. 86 762 764 Gillies et al. 2005 Drug Discovery Today 10 35 43 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . A multi step synthetic procedure is commonly employed to synthesize the multifunctional dendrimers Kukowska Latallo et al. 2005 Canc. Res. 65 5317 5324 Thomas et al. 2005 J. Med. Chem. 48 3729 3735 Quintana et al. 2002 Pharmaceu. Res. 19 1310 1316 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . However multi step procedures introduce higher polydispersity which has limited their application. Moreover it is extremely difficult to precisely characterize the attached components after each procedure. In some embodiments methods of the present invention provide conjugation of dendrimers with multifunctional small molecule architectures which are loaded with different bioactive molecules. These small molecule derivatives can be easily purified and characterized before attachment to the dendrimers.

In experiments conducted during the course of developing some embodiments of the present invention a unique structural class 6 and 11 was developed . Specifically in some embodiments a dendritic structure was developed which integrates bioactive molecules e.g. FA and MTX and a fluorophore for 11 . In these new multifunctional molecules the trifunctional triazine was chosen as a core scaffold on which two sites could be used for binding bioactive molecules while an azide linker could be linked to its third site. High efficiency click chemistry was employed for the one step conjugation to the alkyne terminal dendrimer which reduced the cross linking byproducts from typical coupling reactions Kolb et al. 2001 Angewandte Chemie Intl. Ed. 40 2004 2021 Kolb et al. 2003 Drug Disc. Today 8 1128 1137 Lewis et al. 2002 Angewandte Chemie Intl. Ed. 41 1053 1057 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The triazine derivatives were synthesized from cyanuric chloride by consecutive aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions under controlled conditions. Coumarine was chosen as the fluorophore due to its small size biocompatibility and ease of to synthetic manipulation Sivakumar et al. 2004 Organic Lett. 6 4603 4606 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Advantages of choosing triazines as substrates to build multivalent PAMAM dendrimers include but are not limited to 1 the fact that multifunctional dendrimers with targeting moiety drug and imaging reagent can be achieved by one step dendrimer modification leading to a narrow range of dendrimer molecular weights and 2 the fact that the sequential reactivity of the three chlorine atoms in the triazine backbone makes these molecules well suited to get high variability useful for combinatorial synthesis. Methods and compositions of some embodiments of the present invention provide access to a novel synthetic route to multifunctional dendrimers.

Moreover experiments conducted during the course of developing some embodiments of the present invention demonstrated that such derivatives e.g. triazine derivatives incorporating the targeting moiety FA and therapeutic drug MTX conjugated to PAMAM dendrimers through click chemistry demonstrated an in vitro dose dependent cytotoxicity with higher cytotoxic potential vs. a similar conjugate synthesized by a multi step approach see e.g. and Example III .

In some embodiments the present invention provides compositions facilitating one step e.g. click chemistry conjugation of functional groups to dendrimers e.g. terminal arms of dendrimers . In some embodiments such compositions comprise multifunctional small molecule architectures e.g. scaffolds which permit conjugation to functional groups e.g. therapeutic groups imaging groups targeting groups pro drugs complexes trigger groups . In some embodiments such functional group conjugated compositions are used for one step conjugation to dendrimers e.g. to terminal branches of dendrimers or modified dendrimers . In some embodiments compositions of the present invention comprise triazine compositions. In some embodiments a triazine composition is trifunctional such that two sites are used for conjugation or binding to functional groups e.g. bioactive molecules and an azide linker is conjugated e.g. linked to the third site. Compositions of the present invention are not limited by the numerical functionality e.g. bifunctional trifunctional quadfunctional or embodiments with higher degrees of are contemplated.

The present invention is not limited to the use of particular types and or kinds of dendrimers e.g. a dendrimer conjugated with at least one functional group . Indeed dendrimeric polymers have been described extensively See e.g. Tomalia Advanced Materials 6 529 1994 Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 138 1990 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Dendrimer polymers are synthesized as defined spherical structures typically ranging from 1 to 20 nanometers in diameter. Methods for manufacturing a G5 PAMAM dendrimer with a protected core are known U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 403 179 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In preferred embodiments the protected core diamine is NH CH CH NHPG. Molecular weight and the number of terminal groups increase exponentially as a function of generation the number of layers of the polymer. In some embodiments of the present invention half generation PAMAM dendrimers are used. For example when an ethylenediamine EDA core is used for dendrimer synthesis alkylation of this core through Michael addition results in a half generation molecule with ester terminal groups amidation of such ester groups with excess EDA results in creation of a full generation amine terminated dendrimer Majoros et al. Eds. 2008 Dendrimer based Nanomedicine Pan Stanford Publishing Pte. Ltd. Singapore p. 42 . Different types of dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates the polymerization process. In some embodiments the PAMAM dendrimers are Baker Huang dendrimers or Baker Huang PAMAM dendrimers see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 251 244 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The dendrimer core structures dictate several characteristics of the molecule such as the overall shape density and surface functionality See e.g. Tomalia et al. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 5305 1990 . Spherical dendrimers can have ammonia as a trivalent initiator core or ethylenediamine EDA as a tetravalent initiator core. Recently described rod shaped dendrimers See e.g. Yin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120 2678 1998 use polyethyleneimine linear cores of varying lengths the longer the core the longer the rod. Dendritic macromolecules are available commercially in kilogram quantities and are produced under current good manufacturing processes GMP for biotechnology applications.

Dendrimers may be characterized by a number of techniques including but not limited to electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light scattering ultraviolet spectrophotometry capillary electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis. These tests assure the uniformity of the polymer population and are important for monitoring quality control of dendrimer manufacture for GMP applications and in vivo usage.

This patent provides methods of introducing a polynucleotide into a eukaryotic cell in vitro comprising contacting the cell with a composition comprising a polynucleotide and a dendrimer polyeation non covalently coupled to the polynucleotide.

Dendrimer antibody conjugates for use in in vitro diagnostic applications have previously been demonstrated See e.g. Singh et al. Clin. Chem. 40 1845 1994 for the production of dendrimer chelant antibody constructs and for the development of boronated dendrimer antibody conjugates for neutron capture therapy each of these latter compounds may be used as a cancer therapeutic See e.g. Wu et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4 449 1994 Wiener et al. Magn. Reson. Med. 31 1 1994 Barth et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 5 58 1994 and Barth et al. .

Some of these conjugates have also been employed in the magnetic resonance imaging of tumors See e.g. Wu et al. 1994 and Wiener et al. 1994 supra . Results from this work have documented that when administered in vivo antibodies can direct dendrimer associated therapeutic agents to antigen bearing tumors. Dendrimers also have been shown to specifically enter cells and carry either chemotherapeutic agents or genetic therapeutics. In particular studies show that cisplatin encapsulated in dendrimer polymers has increased efficacy and is less toxic than cisplatin delivered by other means See e.g. Duncan and Malik Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 23 105 1996 .

Dendrimers have also been conjugated to fluorochromes or molecular beacons and shown to enter cells. They can then be detected within the cell in a manner compatible with sensing apparatus for evaluation of physiologic changes within cells See e.g. Baker et al. Anal. Chem. 69 990 1997 . Finally dendrimers have been constructed as differentiated block copolymers where the outer portions of the molecule may be digested with either enzyme or light induced catalysis See e.g. Urdea and Hom Science 261 534 1993 . This allows the controlled degradation of the polymer to release therapeutics at the disease site and provides a mechanism for an external trigger to release the therapeutic agents.

In experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention dendrimers containing functional components were developed having a therapeutic agent e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent conjugated with one or more functional groups e.g. an imaging agent and a targeting agent e.g. folic acid . The present invention is compatible with additional functional components e.g. trigger agents e.g. for release under hypoxic conditions . In some embodiments synthesis of the functionalized dendrimer is facilitated by use of triazine molecules that are linked to functional components and used for one step e.g. click chemistry addition to terminal arms of dendrimers.

Accordingly the present invention provides synthesis methods compositions and applications for efficient site specific drug delivery using functionalized dendrimers comprising therapeutic agents conjugated with one or more functional groups e.g. imaging agents targeting agents and trigger agents . In particular the present invention relates to dendrimers comprising one or more functional groups conjugated with a therapeutic agent e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent methods of synthesizing the same as well as systems and methods utilizing the therapeutic and diagnostic compositions e.g. in diagnostic and or therapeutic settings e.g. for the delivery of therapeutics imaging and or targeting agents e.g. in disease e.g. cancer diagnosis and or therapy etc. . For example in some embodiments the novel therapeutic and diagnostic compositions comprise a therapeutic agent e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent e.g. MTX conjugated with an imaging agent and a targeting agent e.g. FA . As described in more detail below examples of functional groups include but are not limited to targeting groups trigger groups and imaging groups.

The present invention is not limited to the use of particular therapeutic agents. In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are effective in treating autoimmune disorders and or inflammatory disorders e.g. arthritis . Examples of such therapeutic agents include but are not limited to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs e.g. leflunomide methotrexate sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine biologic agents e.g. rituximab infliximab etanercept adalimumab golimumab nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. ibuprofen celecoxib ketoprofen naproxen piroxicam diclofenac analgesics e.g. acetaminophen tramadol immunomodulators e.g. anakinra abatacept glucocorticoids e.g. prednisone methylprednisone TNF inhibitors e.g. adalimumab certolizumab pegol etanercept golimumab infliximab IL 1 inhibitors and metalloprotease inhibitors. In some embodiments the therapeutic agents include but are not limited to infliximab adalimumab etanercept parenteral gold or oral gold.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are effective in treating cancer see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 471 968 7 078 461 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09 940 243 10 431 682 11 503 742 11 661 465 11 523 509 12 403 179 12 106 876 and 11 827 637 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61 256 759 61 140 840 61 091 608 61 097 780 61 101 461 61 237 172 61 229 168 61 221 596 and 61 251 244 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In some embodiments the ligand e.g. therapeutic agent is conjugated with the dendrimer and or triazine compound via a trigger agent. The present invention is not limited to particular types or kinds of trigger agents.

In some embodiments sustained release e.g. slow release over a period of 24 48 hours of the ligand e.g. therapeutic agent is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent e.g. directly e.g. indirectly through one or more additional functional groups to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ester linkage ether linkage . In some embodiments constitutively active release of a therapeutic agent is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent to a trigger agent that renders the therapeutic agent constitutively active in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ether linkage .

In some embodiments release of a therapeutic agent under specific conditions is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent e.g. directly e.g. indirectly through one or more additional functional groups to a trigger agent that degrades under such specific conditions e.g. through activation of a trigger molecule under specific conditions that leads to release of the therapeutic agent . For example once a conjugate e.g. a therapeutic agent conjugated with a trigger agent and a targeting agent arrives at a target site in a subject e.g. a tumor or a site of inflammation components in the target site e.g. a tumor associated factor or an inflammatory or pain associated factor interact with the trigger agent thereby initiating cleavage of the therapeutic agent from the trigger agent. In some embodiments the trigger agent is configured to degrade e.g. release the therapeutic agent upon exposure to a tumor associated factor e.g. hypoxia and pH an enzyme e.g. glucuronidase and or plasmin a cathepsin a matrix metalloproteinase a hormone receptor e.g. integrin receptor hyaluronic acid receptor luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor etc. cancer and or tumor specific DNA sequence an inflammatory associated factor e.g. chemokine cytokine etc. or other moiety.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a therapeutic agent conjugated with a trigger agent that is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by hypoxia e.g. indolequinone . Hypoxia is a feature of several disease states including cancer inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis as well as an indicator of respiratory depression e.g. resulting from analgesic drugs .

Advances in the chemistry of bioreductive drug activation have led to the design of various hypoxia selective drug delivery systems in which the pharmacophores of drugs are masked by reductively cleaved groups. In some embodiments the trigger agent is utilizes a quinone N oxide and or hetero aromatic nitro groups. For example a quinone present in a conjugate is reduced to phenol under hypoxia conditions with spontaneous formation of lactone that serves as a driving force for drug release. In some embodiments a heteroaromatic nitro compound present in a conjugate e.g. a therapeutic agent conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly with a trigger agent is reduced to either an amine or a hydroxylamine thereby triggering the spontaneous release of a therapeutic agent. In some embodiments the trigger agent degrades upon detection of reduced pO2 concentrations e.g. through use of a redox linker .

The concept of pro drug systems in which the pharmacophores of drugs are masked by reductively cleavable groups has been widely explored by many research groups and pharmaceutical companies see e.g. Beall H. D. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1998. 41 24 p. 4755 4766 Ferrer S. D. P. Naughton and M. D. Threadgill Tetrahedron 2003. 59 19 p. 3445 3454 Naylor M. A. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1997. 40 15 p. 2335 2346 Phillips R. M. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1999. 42 20 p. 4071 4080 Zhang Z. et al. Organic Biomolecular Chemistry 2005. 3 10 p. 1905 1910 each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Several such hypoxia activated pro drugs have been advanced to clinical investigations and work in relevant oxygen concentrations to prevent cerebral damage. The present invention is not limited to particular hypoxia activated trigger agents. In some embodiments the hypoxia activated trigger agents include but are not limited to indolequinones nitroimidazoles and nitroheterocycles see e.g. Damen E. W. P. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 2002. 10 1 p. 71 77 Hay M. P. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2003. 46 25 p. 5533 5545 Hay M. P. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society Perkin Transactions 1 1999 19 p. 2759 2770 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a tumor associated enzyme. For example in some embodiments the trigger agent that is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a glucuronidase. Glucuronic acid can be attached to several anticancer drugs via various linkers. These anticancer drugs include but are not limited to doxorubicin paclitaxel docetaxel 5 fluorouracil 9 aminocamtothecin as well as other drugs under development. These pro drugs are generally stable at physiological pH and are significantly less toxic than the parent drugs.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with brain enzymes. For example trigger agents such as indolequinone are reduced by brain enzymes such as for example diaphorase DT diaphorase see e.g. Damen E. W. P. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 2002. 10 1 p. 71 77 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . For example in such embodiments the antagonist is only active when released during hypoxia to prevent respiratory failure.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a protease. The present invention is not limited to any particular protease. In some embodiments the protease is a cathepsin. In some embodiments a trigger comprises a Lys Phe PABC moiety e.g. that acts as a trigger . In some embodiments a Lys Phe PABC moiety linked to doxorubicin mitomycin C and paclitaxel are utilized as a trigger therapeutic conjugate in a dendrimer conjugate provided herein e.g. that serve as substrates for lysosomal cathepsin B or other proteases expressed e.g. overexpressed in tumor cells. In some embodiments utilization of a 1 6 elimination spacer linker is utilized e.g. to permit release of therapeutic drug post activation of trigger .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with plasmin. The serine protease plasmin is over expressed in many human tumor tissues. Tripeptide specifiers e.g. including but not limited to Val Leu Lys have been identified and linked to anticancer drugs through elimination or cyclization linkers.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a matrix metalloprotease MMP . In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or that associates with Lactamase e.g. a Lactamase activated cephalosporin based pro drug .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or activated by a receptor e.g. expressed on a target cell e.g. a tumor cell .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or activated by a nucleic acid. Nucleic acid triggered catalytic drug release can be utilized in the design of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus in some embodiments disease specific nucleic acid sequence is utilized as a drug releasing enzyme like catalyst e.g. via complex formation with a complimentary catalyst bearing nucleic acid and or analog . In some embodiments the release of a therapeutic agent is facilitated by the therapeutic component being attached to a labile protecting group such as for example cisplatin or methotrexate being attached to a photolabile protecting group that becomes released by laser light directed at cells emitting a color of fluorescence e.g. in addition to and or in place of target activated activation of a trigger component of a dendrimer conjugate . In some embodiments the therapeutic device also may have a component to monitor the response of the tumor to therapy. For example where a therapeutic agent of the dendrimer induces apoptosis of a target cell e.g. a cancer cell e.g. a prostate cancer cell the caspase activity of the cells may be used to activate a green fluorescence. This allows apoptotic cells to turn orange combination of red and green while residual cells remain red. Any normal cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis in collateral damage fluoresce green.

In some embodiments a dendrimer is conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly e.g. via a triazine compound with a targeting agent. The present invention is not limited to any particular targeting agent. In some embodiments targeting agents are conjugated to a dendrimer eg. directly or indirectly for delivery to desired body regions e.g. to the central nervous system CNS to a tumor . The targeting agents are not limited to targeting specific body regions.

In some embodiments the targeting agent is a moiety that has affinity for a tumor associated factor. For example a number of targeting agents are contemplated to be useful in the present invention including but not limited to RGD sequences low density lipoprotein sequences a NAALADase inhibitor epidermal growth factor and other agents that bind with specificity to a target cell e.g. a cancer cell .

The present invention is not limited to cancer and or tumor targeting agents. Indeed multifunctional dendrimers can be targeted e.g. via a linker conjugated to the dendrimer wherein the linker comprises a targeting agent to a variety of target cells or tissues e.g. to a biologically relevant environment via conjugation to an appropriate targeting agent. For example in some embodiments the targeting agent is a moiety that has affinity for an inflammatory factor e.g. a cytokine or a cytokine receptor moiety e.g. TNF receptor . In some embodiments the targeting agent is a sugar peptide antibody or antibody fragment hormone hormone receptor or the like.

In some embodiments of the present invention the targeting agent includes but is not limited to an antibody receptor ligand hormone vitamin and antigen however the present invention is not limited by the nature of the targeting agent. In some embodiments the antibody is specific for a disease specific antigen. In some embodiments the disease specific antigen comprises a tumor specific antigen. In some embodiments the receptor ligand includes but is not limited to a ligand for CFTR EGFR estrogen receptor FGR2 folate receptor IL 2 receptor glycoprotein and VEGFR. In some embodiments the receptor ligand is folic acid.

Antibodies can be generated to allow for the targeting of antigens or immunogens e.g. tumor tissue or pathogen specific antigens on various biological targets e.g. pathogens tumor cells normal tissue . Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain Fab fragments and an Fab expression library.

In some embodiments a dendrimer is conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly e.g. via a triazine compound to an imaging agent. A multiplicity of imaging agents find use in the present invention. In some embodiments a multifunctional dendrimer comprises at least one imaging agent that can be readily imaged. The present invention is not limited by the nature of the imaging component used. In some embodiments of the present invention imaging modules comprise surface modifications of quantum dots See e.g. Chan and Nie Science 281 2016 1998 such as zinc sulfide capped cadmium selenide coupled to biomolecules Sooklal Adv. Mater. 10 1083 1998 .

In some embodiments once a component s of a targeted multifunctional dendrimer has attached to or been internalized into a target cell e.g. tumor cell and or inflammatory cell one or more modules on serves to image its location. In some embodiments chelated paramagnetic ions such as Gd III diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid Gd III DTPA are conjugated to the multifunctional dendrimer. Other paramagnetic ions that may be useful in this context include but are not limited to gadolinium manganese copper chromium iron cobalt erbium nickel europium technetium indium samarium dysprosium ruthenium ytterbium yttrium and holmium ions and combinations thereof.

Dendrimeric gadolinium contrast agents have even been used to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors using dynamic MRI based on how the vasculature for the latter type of tumor images more densely Adam et al. Ivest. Rad. 31 26 1996 . Thus MRI provides a particularly useful imaging system of the present invention.

Multifunctional dendrimers allow functional microscopic imaging of tumors and provide improved methods for imaging. The methods find use in vivo in vitro and ex vivo. For example in one embodiment dendrimer functional groups are designed to emit light or other detectable signals upon exposure to light. Although the labeled functional groups may be physically smaller than the optical resolution limit of the microscopy technique they become self luminous objects when excited and are readily observable and measurable using optical techniques. In some embodiments of the present invention sensing fluorescent biosensors in a microscope involves the use of tunable excitation and emission filters and multiwavelength sources See e.g. Farkas et al. SPEI 2678 200 1997 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In embodiments where the imaging agents are present in deeper tissue longer wavelengths in the Near infrared NMR are used See e.g. Lester et al. Cell Mol. Biol. 44 29 1998 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Biosensors that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to fluorescent dyes and molecular beacons.

In some embodiments of the present invention in vivo imaging is accomplished using functional imaging techniques. Functional imaging is a complementary and potentially more powerful techniques as compared to static structural imaging. Functional imaging is best known for its application at the macroscopic scale with examples including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and Positron Emission Tomography PET . However functional microscopic imaging may also be conducted and find use in in vivo and ex vivo analysis of living tissue. Functional microscopic imaging is an efficient combination of 3 D imaging 3 D spatial multispectral volumetric assignment and temporal sampling in short a type of 3 D spectral microscopic movie loop. Interestingly cells and tissues autofluoresce when excited by several wavelengths providing much of the basic 3 D structure needed to characterize several cellular components e.g. the nucleus without specific labeling. Oblique light illumination is also useful to collect structural information and is used routinely. As opposed to structural spectral microimaging functional spectral microimaging may be used with biosensors which act to localize physiologic signals within the cell or tissue. For example in some embodiments biosensor comprising pro drug complexes are used to image upregulated receptor families such as the folate or EGF classes. In such embodiments functional biosensing therefore involves the detection of physiological abnormalities relevant to carcinogenesis or malignancy even at early stages. A number of physiological conditions may be imaged using the compositions and methods of the present invention including but not limited to detection of nanoscopic biosensors for pH oxygen concentration Ca concentration and other physiologically relevant analytes.

In some embodiments the present invention provides multifunctional dendrimers e.g. conjugated with a triazine compound having a biological monitoring component. The biological monitoring or sensing component of a multifunctional dendrimer is one that can monitor the particular response in a target cell e.g. tumor cell induced by an agent e.g. a therapeutic agent provided by a multifunctional dendrimer . While the present invention is not limited to any particular monitoring system the invention is illustrated by methods and compositions for monitoring cancer treatments. In preferred embodiments of the present invention the agent induces apoptosis in cells and monitoring involves the detection of apoptosis. In some embodiments the monitoring component is an agent that fluoresces at a particular wavelength when apoptosis occurs. For example in a preferred embodiment caspase activity activates green fluorescence in the monitoring component. Apoptotic cancer cells which have turned red as a result of being targeted by a particular signature with a red label turn orange while residual cancer cells remain red. Normal cells induced to undergo apoptosis e.g. through collateral damage if present will fluoresce green.

In these embodiments fluorescent groups such as fluorescein are employed in the imaging agent. Fluorescein is easily attached to the dendrimer surface via the isothiocyanate derivatives available from MOLECULAR PROBES Inc. This allows the multifunctional dendrimer or components thereof to be imaged with the cells via confocal microscopy. Sensing of the effectiveness of the multifunctional dendrimer or components thereof is preferably achieved by using fluorogenic peptide enzyme substrates. For example apoptosis caused by the therapeutic agent results in the production of the peptidase caspase 1 ICE . CALBIOCHEM sells a number of peptide substrates for this enzyme that release a fluorescent moiety. A particularly useful peptide for use in the present invention is MCA Tyr Glu Val Asp Gly Trp Lys DNP NH SEQ ID NO 1 where MCA is the 7 methoxycoumarin 4 yl acetyl and DNP is the 2 4 dinitrophenyl group See e.g. Talanian et al. J. Biol. Chem. 272 9677 1997 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In this peptide the MCA group has greatly attenuated fluorescence due to fluorogenic resonance energy transfer FRET to the DNP group. When the enzyme cleaves the peptide between the aspartic acid and glycine residues the MCA and DNP are separated and the MCA group strongly fluoresces green excitation maximum at 325 nm and emission maximum at 392 nm . In some embodiments the lysine end of the peptide is linked to pro drug complex so that the MCA group is released into the cytosol when it is cleaved. The lysine end of the peptide is a useful synthetic handle for conjugation because for example it can react with the activated ester group of a bifunctional linker such as Mal PEG OSu. Thus the appearance of green fluorescence in the target cells produced using these methods provides a clear indication that apoptosis has begun if the cell already has a red color from the presence of aggregated quantum dots the cell turns orange from the combined colors .

Additional fluorescent dyes that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to acridine orange reported as sensitive to DNA changes in apoptotic cells see e.g. Abrams et al. Development 117 29 1993 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and cis parinaric acid sensitive to the lipid peroxidation that accompanies apoptosis see e.g. Hockenbery et al. Cell 75 241 1993 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . It should be noted that the peptide and the fluorescent dyes are merely exemplary. It is contemplated that any peptide that effectively acts as a substrate for a caspase produced as a result of apoptosis finds use with the present invention.

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction click chemistry . Moreover in some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. terminal arm of a dendrimer and a triazine compound e.g. 

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. a terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional ligand is accomplished during a one pot reaction. The term one pot synthesis reaction or equivalents thereof e.g. 1 pot one pot etc. refers to a chemical synthesis method in which all reactants are present in a single vessel. Reactants may be added simultaneously or sequentially with no limitation as to the duration of time elapsing between introduction of sequentially added reactants. In some embodiments a one pot reaction occurs wherein a hydroxyl terminated dendrimer e.g. HO PAMAM dendrimer is reacted with one or more functional ligands e.g. a therapeutic agent a pro drug a trigger agent a targeting agent an imaging agent in one vessel such conjugation being facilitated by ester coupling agents e.g. 2 chloro 1 methylpyridinium iodide and 4 dimethylamino pyridine see e.g. International Patent Application No. PCT US2010 042556 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Functionalized nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers often contain moieties including but not limited to ligands functional ligands conjugates therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents fluorophores that are conjugated to the periphery. Such moieties may for example be conjugated to one or more dendrimer branch termini. Classical multi step conjugation strategies used during the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers generate a stochastic distribution of products with differing numbers of ligands attached per dendrimer molecule thereby creating a population of dendrimers with a wide distribution in the numbers of ligands attached. The low structural uniformity of such dendrimer populations negatively affects properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting. Difficulties in quantifying and resolving such populations to yield samples with sufficient structural uniformity can pose challenges. However in some embodiments use of separation methods e.g. reverse phase chromatography customized for optimal separation of dendrimer populations in conjunction with peak fitting analysis methods allows isolation and identification of subpopulations of functionalized dendrimers with high structural uniformity see e.g. U.S. Provisional Pat. App. No. 61 237 172 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In certain embodiments such methods and systems provide a dendrimer product made by the process comprising a conjugation of at least one ligand type to a dendrimer to yield a population of ligand conjugated dendrimers b separation of the population of ligand conjugated dendrimers with reverse phase HPLC to result in subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers indicated by a chromatographic trace and c application of peak fitting analysis to the chromatographic trace to identify subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers wherein the structural uniformity of ligand conjugates per molecule of dendrimer within said subpopulation is e.g. approximately 80 or more.

For example a therapeutic agent may be any agent selected from the group comprising but not limited to a pain relief agent a pain relief agent antagonist a chemotherapeutic agent an anti oncogenic agent an anti angiogenic agent a tumor suppressor agent an anti microbial agent or an expression construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a therapeutic protein.

In some embodiments the dendrimer is co administered with one or more pain relief agent antagonists see e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 570 977 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Where clinical applications are contemplated in some embodiments of the present invention the dendrimer conjugates are prepared as part of a pharmaceutical composition in a form appropriate for the intended application. Generally this entails preparing compositions that are essentially free of pyrogens as well as other impurities that could be harmful to humans or animals. However in some embodiments of the present invention a straight dendrimer formulation may be administered using one or more of the routes described herein.

In preferred embodiments the dendrimer conjugates are used in conjunction with appropriate salts and buffers to render delivery of the compositions in a stable manner to allow for uptake by target cells. Buffers also are employed when the dendrimer conjugates are introduced into a patient. Aqueous compositions comprise an effective amount of the dendrimer conjugates to cells dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or aqueous medium. Such compositions also are referred to as inocula. The phrase pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce adverse allergic or other untoward reactions when administered to an animal or a human. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with vectors cells or tissues its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients may also be incorporated into the compositions.

In some embodiments of the present invention the active compositions include classic pharmaceutical preparations. Administration of these compositions according to the present invention is via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. This includes oral nasal buccal rectal vaginal or topical. Alternatively administration may be by orthotopic intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.

The active dendrimer conjugates may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally or intratumorally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts are prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

In some embodiments a therapeutic agent is released from dendrimer conjugates within a target cell e.g. within an endosome . This type of intracellular release e.g. endosomal disruption of a linker therapeutic conjugate is contemplated to provide additional specificity for the compositions and methods of the present invention. The present invention provides dendrimers with multiple e.g. 100 150 reactive sites for the conjugation of linkers and or functional groups comprising but not limited to therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents and biological monitoring agents.

The compositions and methods of the present invention are contemplated to be equally effective whether or not the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention comprise a fluorescein e.g. FITC imaging agent. Thus each functional group present in a dendrimer composition is able to work independently of the other functional groups. Thus the present invention provides dendrimer conjugates that can comprise multiple combinations of targeting therapeutic imaging and biological monitoring functional groups.

The present invention also provides a very effective and specific method of delivering molecules e.g. therapeutic and imaging functional groups to the interior of target cells e.g. cancer cells . Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides methods of therapy that comprise or require delivery of molecules into a cell in order to function e.g. delivery of genetic material such as siRNAs .

The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it may be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

Upon formulation dendrimer conjugates are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as injectable solutions drug release capsules and the like. For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution for example the solution is suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. For example one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion see for example Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition pages 1035 1038 and 1570 1580 . In some embodiments of the present invention the active particles or agents are formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise about 0.0001 to 1.0 milligrams or about 0.001 to 0.1 milligrams or about 0.1 to 1.0 or even about 10 milligrams per dose or so. Multiple doses may be administered.

Additional formulations that are suitable for other modes of administration include vaginal suppositories and pessaries. A rectal pessary or suppository may also be used. Suppositories are solid dosage forms of various weights and shapes usually medicated for insertion into the rectum vagina or the urethra. After insertion suppositories soften melt or dissolve in the cavity fluids. In general for suppositories traditional binders and carriers may include for example polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 10 preferably 1 2 . Vaginal suppositories or pessaries are usually globular or oviform and weighing about 5 g each. Vaginal medications are available in a variety of physical forms e.g. creams gels or liquids which depart from the classical concept of suppositories. In addition suppositories may be used in connection with colon cancer. The dendrimer conjugates also may be formulated as inhalants for the treatment of lung cancer and such like.

In some embodiments the present invention also provides kits comprising one or more of the reagents and tools necessary to generate a dendrimer conjugated with one or more triazine compositions e.g. scaffolds e.g. triazine compositions capable of click chemistry for use in one step synthesis of functionalized dendrimers e.g. triazine compositions having one or more functional groups and methods of using such dendrimers.

The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspects of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.

Compound was synthesized according to the literature.G5 NHAc Alkyne14 White solid MALDI TOF mass 32774. The H NMR integration determined the mean number of Acetyl groups per dendrimer is 80.1. The mean number of Alkyne ligands per dendrimer is 12.3.

The number of ligands that attached to the dendrimer were determined by comparing the integration of the methyl protons of the terminal acetyl groups to the aromatic protons on the conjugated ligands see e.g. Mullen D. G. Acs Nano 2010 4 657 670 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The number of acetyl groups per dendrimer was independently determined by first computing the total number of end groups from the number average molecular weight GPC and potentiometric titration data for G5 NH 100 as previously described see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 5899 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The total number of end groups was applied to the ratio of primary amines to acetyl groups obtained from the H NMR of the partially acetylated dendrimer to compute the average number of acetyl groups per dendrimer.

This example describes the synthesis of triazine derivatives their conjugation to PAMAM dendrimers and in vitro cytotoxicity studies on FR expressing KB cells using these dendrimer conjugates.

Trifunctional triazine derivatives were synthesized from cyanuric chloride by consecutive aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions which were controlled by temperature to run in a stepwise manner . Folic acid FA was conjugated to the triazine through an amide bond. An ester bond was chosen for methodtrexate MTX conjugation with expectation for improved release of drug. The monosubstituted triazine Triazine N1 was synthesized by adding 3 azidopropan 1 amine to a solution of cyanuric chloride in acetone at 0 C. The second substitution was carried out in the same solvent at room temperature with 2 aminoethanol. The bisubstituted Triazine N OH 2 was treated with tert butyl 2 2 2 aminoethoxy ethoxy ethyl carbamate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine DIPEA in tetrahydrofuran THF at 70 C. to form Trazine N OH NHBoc 3 containing a primary amine in a protected form which was used for conjugation with FA. Reaction of 2 with unprotected 2 2 ethane 1 2 diylbis oxy diethanamine had a poor yield due to a major by product of the triazine dimer. After removal of the BOC protecting group FA was coupled to Triazine N OH NH4 by N N Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC in dimethylsulfoxide DMSO . This sample was purified on RP HPLC. Two isomers 5 and carboxyl 6 group linked products were separated and purified and relatively higher 60 carboxyl linked product was obtained vs. isomer 40 based on HPLC analysis. Both isomers were conjugated to PAMAM dendrimers. Resulting conjugates showed similar binding affinities to purified FR in a surface plasmon resonance SPR based binding study. This finding was consistent with other research group s results see e.g. Leamon C. P. et al. J Drug Target 1999 7 157 Bettio A. et al. each incorporated by reference in their entireties . The HPLC purified carboxyl group linked isomer 5 was used for further studies due to its relatively higher yield.

The strategy for the synthesis of trifunctional Triazine N MTX FA 8 was first approached by direct coupling MTX with Triazine N OH FA 5 using DCC 4 dimethylamino pyridine DMAP or DCC 4 pyrrolidinopyridine see e.g. Devineni D. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 1995 6 203 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . However both reactions were unsuccessful due to very low yield. To solve this problem an alternate synthetic route was chosen . The hydroxyl group of 5 was first activated with bis 4 nitrophenyl carbonate to provide carbonate 7. Then carbonate 7 was treated with MTX ethylamine 11 to form the target compound Triazine N MTX FA 8. Control sample Triazine N MTX NHBoc 13 was synthesized in a similar manner .

 MTX ethylamine 11 was synthesized following the literature see e.g. Nagy A. et al. P Natl Acad Sci USA 1993 90 6373 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In brief benzotriazol 1 yloxytris dimethylamino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate BOP activated 4 amino 4 deoxy N methyl pteroic acid APA in DMSO was reacted with the potassium salt of glutamic acid tert butyl ester to form the carboxyl protected MTX derivative. The selectively protected MTX derivative was then coupled to tert butyl 2 hydroxyethyl carbamate by 2 chloro 1 methyl pyridinium iodide CMPI DMAP. The t butyl and BOC protecting groups were then removed by trifluoroacetic acid TFA at the same time to afford the MTX ethylamine 11. Alkyne terminated generation 5 G5 PAMAM dendrimer G5 NHAc Alkyne 14 has been previously synthesized see e.g. Mullen D. G. et al. Acs Nano 2010 4 657 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Partially acetylated dendrimers was employed in this study because these materials have been shown to be most effective for targeted drug delivery applications see e.g. Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 

Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The parent amine terminated materials have been shown to non selectively cause cell membrane permeability and are not suited for in vivo targeted drug delivery applications.Target conjugate G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 control samples G5 Triazine OH FA 16 and G5 Triazine MTX NHBoc 17 were synthesized by one step click reaction to the G5 Ac Alkyne 14 with corresponding triazine derivatives . MALDI TOF and NMR analyses were performed to determine the degree of functionalization.

The cytotoxicity of the newly synthesized G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 was determined in vitro by the XTT assay in KB cells which express a high cell surface FR . The cytotoxicity with another batch of G5 FA MTX synthesized by Cambrex Inc. was also compared using the classic sequential conjugation synthetic pathway see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Previous studies have shown that this batch of Cambrex conjugates was cytotoxic in vitro and tumoricidal in vivo with potency similar to that of our previously published compound see e.g. Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The newly synthesized G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 inhibited the KB cell growth in a dose dependence fashion with increased cytotoxic potential vs. the Cambrex batch. The G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 and the Cambrex conjugate inhibited cells growth with IC50 of 5 and 20 nM respectively. The Cambrex conjugate has 4 5 FA and 7 8 MTX per dendrimer while 15 has 3.1 each of the FA and MTX per dendrimer. Despite the increased MTX content on the Cambrex conjugate 15 carried higher cytotoxic potential. As MTX has 1000 fold more affinity toward dihyrofolate reductase DHFR vs. FA it is possible that the close molecular proximity of the FA and MTX on 15 but not on the Cambrex conjugate may allow the preferential binding of MTX on 15 as it is being juxtaposed at the DHFR binding site. The control conjugate G5 Triazine MTX 17 without the targeting moiety FA also showed a dose dependent cytotoxicity though with a much higher IC50 75 nM vs. G5 Triazine MTX FA 15. As the G5 Triazine MTX conjugate is unlikely to be taken up through the reduced folate carrier RFC due to size constraints of this membrane channel it is possible that it is internalized into the cells through polyvalent binding through the FR.

In order to confirm that the observed cytotoxicity was not due to free MTX released from the conjugate during incubation in the cell culture medium the stability of the dendrimer conjugate was tested in the cell culture medium. For this analysis the G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 was incubated with cell culture medium for 1 4 24 and 72 h. During the 72 h incubation time periods both FA and MTX showed a slow release in a time dependent fashion . Amide linked FA was quite stable against hydrolytic cleavage whereas the ester linked MTX was more liable to hydrolysis 1.0 FA vs. 4.6 MTX for the 72 h period studied. This data shows that the major antiproliferative effect of the G5 Triazine MTX FA 15 was not the result of free MTX.
