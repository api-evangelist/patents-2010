Mobile devices such as cellular telephones are typically configured to automatically provide a missed call notification for unanswered incoming voice calls made to subscribers whose devices are in a responsive state i.e. turned on . For example a missed call notification to a mobile device which is in a responsive state may include a voicemail indicator or icon indicating that a calling party has left a voicemail to a called party associated with a mobile device. A missed call notification to a mobile device which is in a responsive state may also include a missed call message indicating that a calling party had initiated a call to the mobile device which was terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily prior to being routed to voicemail. Currently however mobile devices are unable to provide missed call notifications to users when the devices are in a non responsive state. For example missed call notifications are not generated for calls made to a mobile device which is turned off and where the calling party chooses not to leave a voicemail message. As another example missed call notifications are also not generated for calls made to mobile devices which are in a flight or airplane mode during which the mobile device s capacity to place or receive calls or text messages is disabled. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.

Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing notification of missed voice calls directed to non responsive called party devices in a communication network. An incoming call directed to a called party device when the called party device is in a non responsive state are received at a messaging platform. In accordance with an embodiment the incoming call may be received at the messaging platform immediately e.g. when a switch in the communication network determines that the called party device is in a non responsive state and subsequently diverts the incoming call to the messaging platform . In accordance with another embodiment the incoming call may be allowed to ring on the called party device and then disconnected prior to the call being received by the messaging platform e.g. an incoming call to the called party device is allowed to continue to ring by the calling party who then subsequently hangs up before the call is diverted to the messaging platform . Call data associated with the call is stored at the messaging platform. The stored call data is utilized to generate a notification of the call. The notification of the call is sent from the messaging platform to the called party device or another device associated with the called party. The notification may include an identification of the calling party and a date and time when the call was made.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below.
