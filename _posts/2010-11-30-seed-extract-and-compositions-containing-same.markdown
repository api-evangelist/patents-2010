The genus comprises a large number of ligneous species well adapted to hot and dry climates with very low precipitation. Certain species are widespread in the semi desertic tropical regions of West Africa Australia Pakistan etc. Many thus have an ecological role and some an important economic role source of gum Arabic source of tannins our mimosa horticultural with ornamental flowers. In comparison with these species well known in the West has remained quite marginal. It is above all the alimentary use of the seeds thereof that has led to some written works regarding it. Current data concerning it mainly stems from two or three Western works on African Sahelian plants and documents of international organisations written by authors who are for the most part from Burkina Faso. For instance this traditional use is perfectly set out in the reports of Mr. Ou tian Bognounou Officier and Chevalier de l Ordre National Chevalier des Palmes Acad miques floristics and ethnobotanics research officer of the INERA of Burkina Faso co authored with Mr. Marc Olivier ethnobotanics consultant.

This shrub the botanical name of which is Rchb. Ex DC. belongs to the order of Fabales and to the botanical family of Mimosaceae. The common names for the plant in Burkina Faso are zanmn karitiga zamenega kiese mamonguala the tree that catches in passing in Senegal 16 different names from 12 ethnic groups.

This sarmentous and thorny shrub of 2 to 5 meters height can occasionally become a tree reaching 8 m with a narrow and open crown. Its bark is often cracked fibrous grey with white streaks.

Several compositions for application by topical route are presented below.

The extracts may be advantageously integrated in oral compositions typically in compositions enabling the administration of 50 mg to 200 mg of extract a day.

The peptide and oside extract of which is an extract prepared by hydrolysis such as enzymatic hydrolysis is named hereafter in this example hydrolysate.

The biological activities of the hydrolysate were evaluated by a test of the modulation of expression of genes on reconstructed epidermis. Thus the expression of 64 genes of major interest in skin and cosmetic physiology was studied by PCR array on reconstructed epidermis during differentiation.

The hydrolysate 0.05 and 0.1 w v was added to a culture medium of reconstructed epidermis on J5. These were then incubated for 48 hours. The expression of the selected markers was evaluated by RT PCR quantitative PCR array .

The variation in expression of the studied markers with respect to the control was expressed in percentage Control 100 .

The most significant results are presented in the table below and tend to show that the hydrolysate by making the gene expression of certain markers vary has a particular interest especially in the following activities 

Thus at the end of this screening the activity of the hydrolysate was evaluated in two areas of interest in dermo cosmetics barrier and epidermal moisturising as well as the dermal matrix and oxidative stress.

The implementation of the barrier function is linked to epidermal differentiation that results in the formation of the SC . Different structures enable the SC to ensure its barrier function the intercellular lipids the cornified envelope corneodesmosomes.

This barrier is reinforced by a second line of defence situated in the and constituted of tight junctions.

Normal human keratinocytes were treated for 24 or 48 hours by 0.01 or 0.05 hydrolysate w v in parallel keratinocyte controls were cultivated under conditions favourable to differentiation High Ca calcium supplemented medium . The gene expression of the selected markers was analysed by quantitative RT PCR in real time.

The results were analysed statistically by a one way variance analysis ANOVA followed by a Dunnett test 

The level of gene expression was expressed in relative quantity RQ and the effect of the treatment in relation to the control cells in percentage increase.

The hydrolysate very strongly and significantly increased the gene expression of keratin 1 and keratin 10. Furthermore the hydrolysate significantly increased the gene expression of filaggrin involucrin loricrin and transglutaminase 1 TGase 1 .

The hydrolysate thus contributes to reinforcing the cornified envelope and thus to improving the resistance of the epidermal barrier.

In addition filaggrin as precursor of NMF natural moisturizing factor is involved in the moisturising of the epidermis. Thus through an action on the filaggrin hydrolysate contributes to improving the moisturising of the epidermis.

The hydrolysate significantly increased the gene expression of desmoglein 1 Dsg 1 and desmocolline 1 Dsc 1 constituent proteins of corneodesmosomes this effect is thus in favour of a reinforcement of the cohesion of the

The activity of hydrolysate was studied by quantitative RT PCR on the level of expression of 16 genes mainly coding for tight junction proteins as well as for the major proteins of the communicating junctions of the epidermis.

Normal human keratinocytes were treated or not control with 0.05 and 0.1 hydrolysate w v or the reference 1.5 mM calcium chloride CaCl for 24 hours. The expression of the markers was evaluated by quantitative RT PCR PCR array .

The variation in the expression of the markers studied compared to the control was expressed in percentage Control 100 .

The results presented below show that hydrolysate had a similar effect to the positive control on the expression of junction messengers in fact hydrolysate led to a significant increase in the expression of markers of Claudin 1 Occludin and Cingulin tight junctions. An inhibition in the expression of the Gap Junction Protein 2 was also observed. The communicating junction marker Gap Junction Protein 2 code for the protein connexin 26 which is more particularly expressed in the keratinocytes in proliferation.

Thus hydrolysate by stimulating the expression of tight junction markers and by inhibiting the expression of the communicating junction marker Gap Junction Protein 2 exhibited a pro differentiating effect as well as a positive effect with regard to the reinforcement of the cutaneous barrier making it possible to limit the losses in water and in solutes through the para cellular spaces.

Normal human keratinocytes were treated for 24 or 48 hours with 0.05 or 0.1 w v hydrolysate in parallel keratinocytes controls were cultivated in conditions favourable to differentiation High Ca calcium supplemented medium . The gene expression of the tight junction markers was analysed by quantitative RT PCR in real time.

The results were analysed statistically by a one way variance analysis ANOVA followed by a Dunnett test 

The level of gene expression was expressed in relative quantity RQ and the effect of the treatment compared to the control cells in percentage increase.

The hydrolysate significantly increased the gene expression of Claudin 1 and occludin thereby confirming the results obtained during the preceding PCR array study. Through this action and in addition to its action on filaggrin it thus helps in maintaining the moisturising of the epidermis while limiting water losses.

A positive effect of the extract according to the present invention on the different structures involved in the implementation of the barrier function has been highlighted in fact the extract is capable of positively regulating the expression of the markers of the cornified envelope corneodesmosomes and tight junctions. These properties enable the extract hydrolysate of to contribute to the solidity and sealing of the barrier function while at the same time participating in maintaining a good level of moisturising.

Modifications of the skin with age result from modifications of the cellular functions and progressive modifications of the composition and the structure of the extra cellular dermal matrix. In fact the dermis undergoes a gradual loss of its thickness with a reduction of essential macromolecules such as collagen and elastin. This diminution may be attributed to a reduction in the synthesis thereof and or to an increase in the degradation thereof by MMP matrix metalloproteinases for example.

The relation between oxidative stress and ageing is today well established. In fact there is an accumulation in the aged cells of damaged molecules leading to an alteration of cellular functions. To protect itself against this oxidative stress the

cell has different anti oxidant defence mechanisms of which the microsomal heme oxygenase enzyme forms part.

The effect of hydrolysate on the modulation of the extra cellular matrix of the dermis and on the stimulation of the anti oxidant defences was evaluated on a dermal fibroblasts model in which the gene expression of elastin MMP1 and heme oxygenase 1 was studied by quantitative RT PCR in real time.

Normal human fibroblasts were treated for 24h with 0.01 and 0.05 hydrolysate w v or with the reference TGF 1 at 5 ng ml. The gene expression of the selected markers was analysed by quantitative RT PCR in real time.

The results were analysed statistically by a one way variance analysis ANOVA followed by a Dunnett test 

The level of gene expression was expressed in relative quantity RQ and the effect of the treatment in relation to the control cells in percentage increase or inhibition.

The hydrolysate clearly and significantly stimulated the gene expression of the elastin and very strongly and significantly inhibited the gene expression of MMPI.

Furthermore the hydrolysate significantly stimulated the gene expression of heme oxygenase 1 thereby contributing to reinforcing the anti oxidant defence mechanisms of the cell.

In addition to this physiological mechanism other factors can contribute to accelerating the skin ageing process thus oxygenated free radicals produced under the influence of UV for example can alter the different components of the cell. To defend itself the skin has developed a complex anti oxidant defence system but the accumulation of free radicals can submerge this system of defence and lead to an imbalance having a tendency to result in a pro oxidant state which in the long term will result in the photo ageing of the skin.

Heme oxygenase 1 forms part of said defence system thus by stimulating its expression the extract hydrolysate of according to the invention contributes to reinforcing the defence and protection system of the cell vis vis oxidative stress.

In addition by activating the synthesis of elastin and by limiting the expression of MMPI the extract hydrolysate of according to the invention contributes to protecting the cell against alterations linked to ageing whether intrinsic or extrinsic.
