No. 11 685 173 entitled Systems and Methods for Providing Quality of Service Precedence in TCP Congestion Control filed Mar. 12 2007 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 760 642 on Jul. 20 2010 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to systems and methods for dynamically controlling bandwidth by a proxy of one or more connections.

In networking quality of service QoS systems may be used to specify the precedence of competing packet flows. In some cases these flows may be a simple connection between a sender and a receiver. In other cases these flows may be a connection between a sender and receiver that passes through one or more proxies some or all of which may be transparent to the sender and receiver. Standardized QoS signaling mechanisms exist such the TOS Type of Service RFC 1349 and later the DSCP Differentiated Services Codepoint RFC 2474 RFC 2475 bits in the IP header. However these may not be deployed across networks in a consistent way however and their presence or characteristics cannot be relied upon except when the same administrator controls the entire network. When data traverses networks owned by a third party which is may be the case in wide area networks and especially the Internet in some cases only the most basic IP functionality can be assumed and that the bottleneck gateway will ignore any QoS bits in the packets.

QoS is often implemented at a bandwidth bottlenecks. These bottlenecks sometimes occur at a fast to slow transitions in network speed for example at a device bridging a LAN and a WAN. If there is a backlog of packets from different flows at a device the device can make a decision using QoS about which flow should have a packet sent next. In traditional QoS equalizing bandwidth between connections may be accomplished with fair queuing provided that other circumstances such as excessive losses do not prevent a connection from achieving its fair bandwidth share. In some implementations of fair queuing each connection has its own queue. When the total amount of queuing becomes excessive a packet is dropped from the connection with the longest queue. Because of the nature of fair queuing which outputs packets on a round robin basis the connection with the longest queue is the that is exceeding its fair bandwidth share by the largest margin. Dropping packets from connections going too fast rather than randomly may reduce the unfairness between connections. Connections that are incapable of using their fair bandwidth share may never be targeted while those that continually exceed it may see a much higher loss rate.

However this QoS approach may be dependent on having a backlog of packets across a number of flows which may be inappropriate in cases where backlog is sought to be minimized due to other concerns. These QoS mechanisms also may not apply in cases involving a single flow. Thus there exists a need for systems and methods which allow QoS to be implemented in cases where minimal or no backlog of packets exists and with respect to single flows. These systems and methods should be applicable even in cases where parts of the network which a flow traverses are under the control of a third party.

Many network traffic uses the Transport Control Protocol TCP protocol which is a connection based layer on top of IP. TCP uses a mechanism of slowing down the sending rate when the loss of a packet is detected and speeding up when there is no such loss. Traditional implementations such as TCP Reno may use a sample time of one round trip over the network RTT the time between sending a packet and receiving an acknowledgement of its arrival from the receiving unit . In a round trip in which no packets were lost the amount of data in flight the congestion window may be increased by one full sized packet. Increasing the congestion window will increase the connection bandwidth the network queuing the packet loss rate or some combination of these depending on the state of the network. An alternative method of achieving congestion control in TCP is to use the round trip time as the basic control signal. This is used by TCP Vegas and FAST TCP. In FAST TCP for instance. In these implementations the congestion window may be increased or decreased based on a comparison of a recent packet round trip time against a fastest or average round trip time.

The use of random losses to control connection speed may lead to unfairness in bandwidth allocation between connections. Given two connections one may receive less bandwidth because it is simply unlucky it passes over a link with an inherently higher loss rate such as a wireless network or it may receive less bandwidth because it has a longer path length and hence a longer round trip time than its partner. Because connections speed up once per round trip the ramp up rate may be steeper with short haul connections with long haul ones. Further TCP may be indiscriminate with respect to connection priorities in its slowing down and ramping up of connection bandwidths in response to network events. There thus exists a need for systems and methods which can compensate for the potential unfairness of allocating bandwidth based on random losses and which allow for QoS priorities to be factored into response to packet losses and other congestion events.

The present invention is directed towards systems and methods for dynamically controlling bandwidth of connections. In some embodiments a proxy for one or more connections may allocate distribute or generate indications of network congestion via one or more connections in order to induce the senders of the connections to reduce their rates of transmission. The proxy may allocate distribute or generate these indications in such a way as to provide quality of service to one or more connections or to ensure that a number of connections transmit within an accepted bandwidth limit. In other embodiments a sender of a transport layer connection may have a method for determining a response to congestion indications which accounts for a priority of the connection. In these embodiments a sender may reduce or increase parameters related to transmission rate at different rates according to a priority of the connection.

In a first aspect the present invention relates to methods of distributing congestion events by a device among a plurality of transport layer connections to dynamically alter effective bandwidth available to one or more of the transport layer connections.

In other embodiments the device may allocate congestion events based on assigned bandwidths of the connections.

In a second aspect the present invention relates to systems for distributing congestion events by an intermediate appliance among a plurality of transport layer connections to dynamically alter effective bandwidth available to one or more of the transport layer connections.

The network appliance may comprise a packet processor which receives via a first transport layer connection of the plurality of transport layer connections a first indication of network congestion and a flow controller which selects according to the assigned priorities a second transport layer connection of the plurality of connections and transmits in response to receiving the first indication a second indication of a congestion event via the second transport layer connection. In other embodiments the device may allocate congestion events based on assigned bandwidths of the connections.

In a third aspect the present invention relates to methods for providing by an appliance quality of service levels to transport layer data communications using a transparent proxy to control connection bandwidth. In one embodiment a method comprises determining by an appliance serving as a transparent proxy for a transport layer connection between a sender and a receiver that the rate of transmission of the sender via the transport layer connection differs from a predetermined rate of transmission generating by the appliance in response to the determination an acknowledgement packet containing an indication to alter the rate of transmission and transmitting by the appliance to the sender the generated acknowledgement packet. In this embodiment the acknowledgement may be generated even if there was no acknowledgement received from the receiver. The acknowledgement may contain an indication either to increase or decrease the sender s rate of transmission as appropriate.

In a fourth aspect the present invention relates to computer implemented systems for providing provide quality of service levels to transport layer data communications using a transparent proxy to control connection bandwidth. In one embodiment a network appliance serves as a transparent proxy for a transport layer connection between one or more senders and one or more receivers.

The network appliance may also comprise a packet processing module which transmits to the sender the generated acknowledgement. The acknowledgement may contain an indication either to increase or decrease the sender s rate of transmission as appropriate.

In a fifth aspect the present invention relates to methods for dynamically controlling connection bandwidth by a sender of one or more transport layer connections according to a priority assigned to one or more of the transport layer connections. In one embodiment a method comprises transmitting by a sender data via a first transport layer connection wherein the first transport layer connection has a first congestion window size identifying an amount data to be transmitted by the sender in the absence of an acknowledgement from a receiver receiving by the sender via the first transport layer connection an indication of a packet loss via the first transport layer connection identifying a reduction factor the reduction factor corresponding to a priority assigned by the sender to the first transport layer connection determining a second congestion window size the second congestion window size comprising the first congestion window size reduced by the reduction factor and transmitting by the sender via the first transport layer connection data according to the second congestion window size. In other embodiments a similar method may be applied where a connection priority determines the rate in which congestion window is increased in response to a time interval passing without an indication of a packet loss being received.

In another embodiment the compression engine applies context sensitive compression. In this embodiment the compression engine utilizes knowledge of the data type to select a specific compression algorithm from a suite of suitable algorithms. In some embodiments knowledge of the specific protocol is used to perform context sensitive compression. In one embodiment the appliance or compression engine can use port numbers e.g. well known ports as well as data from the connection itself to determine the appropriate compression algorithm to use.

The compression engine may first use the cache based data to determine one or more data matches for compression and then may check the memory based data to determine one or more data matches for compression. In another case the compression engine may check disk storage for data matches for compression after checking either the cache based and or memory based data history.

In one embodiment multi protocol compression engine compresses bi directionally between clients and servers any TCP IP based protocol including Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI email File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Common Internet File System CIFS protocol file transfer Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol Remote Desktop Protocol RDP Wireless Application Protocol WAP Mobile IP protocol and Voice Over IP VoIP protocol.

The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not overutilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. A receiver side flow control module may control the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer. The flow controller may implement a plurality of data flow control techniques at the transport layer including but not limited to 1 pre acknowledgements 2 window virtualization 3 recongestion techniques 3 local retransmission techniques 4 wavefront detection and disambiguation 5 transport control protocol selective acknowledgements 6 transaction boundary detection techniques and 7 repacketization.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a packet indicating a window size of four packets. This may reduce the overhead by approximately a factor of four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. This window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In an embodiment including TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header may include a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of or B initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet throughput from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. 512 packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load the buffer with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or the TCP Stabilized Vegas algorithm. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit to a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller. In another embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine includes the QoS engine for example separately but in communication with the flow controller . The QoS Engine includes any logic business rules function or operations for performing one or more Quality of Service QoS techniques improving the performance operation or quality of service of any of the network connections. In some embodiments the QoS engine includes network traffic control and management mechanisms that provide different priorities to different users applications data flows or connections. In other embodiments the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain level of performance to a user application data flow or connection.

Now referring to a sample TCP packet is shown. In brief overview a TCP packet comprises a header and payload . The header comprises a number of indications which may be used to indicate transmission events related to data communications and network congestion including an ACK number Explicit Congestion Notification Echo ECE flag ACK flag and Push PSH flag .

Still referring to the sample TCP packet is shown to graphically illustrate some of the information that may be included in a TCP packet. Although the sample shown reflects a particular embodiment of a TCP packet persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many implementations and variations of TCP and other network protocols may be applicable to the systems and methods described herein including the TCP implementations specified in RFC 793 RFC 1122 and specifically RFC 2581 and RFC 3168 relating to congestion control and avoidance. In some of these implementations and others an ECE flag may be utilized to notify the packet recipient that network congestion is occurring. The packet recipient may then elect to slow down their rate of transmission or adopt any other congestion control or avoidance tactics. This ECE flag may also be used in combination with other signaling bits which negotiate with a recipient whether Explicit Congestion Notification ECN is supported. Any bits in any protocol used in the negotiation or signaling of explicit congestion may be referred to as ECN bits.

Now referring to a system for distributing congestion events by a device among a plurality of transport layer connections is shown. In brief overview a number of clients communicate with a number of servers via an appliance . When the appliance receives an indication of network congestion a flow controller operating within the appliance may intercept the indication and transmit a second congestion indication via a different connection. In this way an appliance may allocate congestion indications among connections to control the bandwidth used by each connection. In some embodiments the allocation of congestion indications may be used to aid in providing quality of service QoS guarantees with respect to one or more connections.

Still referring to now in greater detail a number of clients communicate with a number of servers via an appliance . The clients may be connected to the appliance by any means including a LAN WAN MAN or any other network or combination of networks. In some cases the clients may each be connected to the appliance via one or more other appliances. For example the clients may each reside at a branch office while the appliance and servers are located at a central office. The clients may be connected to the appliance via a second appliance located at the branch office. Although the figure depicts a plurality of clients the systems and methods described may also be applied to cases in which a single client is communicating over a plurality of connections to one or more servers.

The servers may be connected to the appliance by any means including a LAN WAN MAN or any other network or combination of networks. The system and methods described may also be applied to cases in which a single server is communicating over a plurality of connections to one or more clients.

In some embodiments the appliance may be serving as a proxy for the connections . In other embodiments the appliance may be serving as a transparent proxy for the connections. The appliance may be providing caching acceleration or any other network services with respect to the connections.

The appliance receives a congestion indication via a connection . A congestion indication may comprise any notification which explicitly communicates network congestion or allows an inference of potential network congestion to be drawn. Congestion indications may comprise without limitation indications of dropped packets indications of delayed packets indications of corrupted packets and explicit congestion indications. Specific examples of congestion indications may include without limitation TCP packets comprising duplicate acknowledgements ACKs and TCP packets comprising one or more marked ECN bits. Congestion indications may also be referred to as indications of congestion events. A congestion event may be any network or device event which is possibly caused by network congestion.

The appliance may then generate a congestion indication to be transmitted via a connection other than a connection corresponding to the connection that the congestion indication was received on. The appliance may generate the congestion indication via any means and may generate and transmit any type of congestion indication. In some embodiments the appliance may generate the congestion indication in a transparent manner such that it appears to the server that the congestion indication originated from client

Referring now to one embodiment of a method for distributing congestion events by a device among a plurality of transport layer connections is shown. In brief overview the method comprises establishing by a device a plurality of transport layer connections one or more of the transport layer connections having an assigned priority step . The device receives via a first transport layer connection a first indication of network congestion step . The device then selects according to the assigned priorities a second transport layer connection step and transmits a second indication of a congestion event via the selected second transport layer connection step . In some embodiments the method may further comprise selecting a third transport layer connection according to the assigned priorities step and transmitting via the third transport layer connection a third congestion indication step .

Still referring to now in greater detail it may be desirable in some network environments to have a means for allocating congestion events. If a network becomes congested it may not be desirable that all of the connections communicating via the network are equally impacted by the congestion. A slowdown in a connection transmitting real time videoconferencing data may result in severe consequences for the recipients of the connection as video quality and response time suffers. By contrast a large file transfer might be able to absorb significant congestion delays without severe negative consequences for a user. However if a number of connections are operating over the same network there may be no guarantee that the first connection to suffer a congestion event such as a dropped packet will be the lowest priority connection. In these cases it may be advantageous for an appliance to redistribute congestion events such that lower priority connections receive congestion events and throttle back their bandwidth accordingly while allowing higher priority connections to continue transmitting at higher rates. In other cases redistributing congestion events may be used to ensure that a number of connections continue to transmit at an equal rate even where congestion events do not occur evenly across all the connections. In still other embodiments a device may distribute congestion events based on transaction size

In the method shown a device may establish a plurality of transport layer connections one or more of the connections having an assigned priority step . A device may establish the plurality of connections with one or more computing devices which may include clients servers and other appliances . In some embodiments the device may establish the transport layer connections in the process of serving as an intermediary for the transport layer connections. In these embodiments two or more of the plurality of transport layer connections may comprise corresponding transport layer connections similar to connections and in . The device may comprise an appliance client agent or server agent. In one embodiment the transport layer connections may comprise TCP connections. In other embodiments the transport layer connections may comprise any other protocol. In one embodiment the device may treat a sequence of packets with the same source and destination as a single connection even if the packets are not sent using a protocol which explicitly uses connections.

The device may assign priorities to one or more of the established connections in any manner. In some embodiments a device may assign a unique priority to each of the plurality of connections. In other embodiments the device may assign a single priority to some or all of the plurality of connections. In some embodiments the device may assign a priority to a connection at the time the connection is establish. In other embodiments the device may assign a priority to a connection only after a congestion event or other event has occurred. In some embodiments the priority assigned to a given connection may remain constant. In other embodiments the priority assigned to a given connection may change over time in response to the properties of the connection and conditions within the device or a network. For example a device may assign a higher priority to connections with relatively low current bandwidth usage and a lower priority to connections using more current bandwidth.

In one embodiment the device may assign priorities based on a protocol or protocols of a connection. For example a device may assign higher priorities to UDP traffic as opposed to TCP traffic. Or for example a device may assign a higher priority to HTTP traffic as opposed to FTP traffic. In another embodiment the device may assign priorities based on one or more properties of the traffic carried via the connections. For example an appliance may assign higher priorities to bursty connections than to connections featuring relatively constant bandwidth. In some embodiments priorities may be explicitly configured either by an administrator of the device or by messages contained in the connections themselves.

In some embodiments an assigned priority may directly correlate to an assigned bandwidth of a connection. For example an appliance may assign a maximum bandwidth of 10 Mb sec to each of the plurality of connections. Or an appliance may assign a target bandwidth of 5 Mb sec to one of the plurality of connections while assigning a target bandwidth of 10 Mb sec to a second one of the plurality of connections.

In other embodiments the assigned priority may correspond to a quality of service level for the connection. A quality of service level may be specified in any manner. In some embodiments the appliance may recognize and or utilize any quality of service indications used in TCP related or IP related protocols in a connection. For example RFC 1349 RFC 2474 and RFC 2475 detail methods by which TCP and IP connections can signal quality and type of service related information.

In still other embodiments the assigned priority may correspond to a current or average transaction size of the connection. In these embodiments the device may assign higher priorities to connections carrying shorter transactions. These connections may be more likely to be carrying time sensitive traffic such as VoIP or remote procedure calls which will be more adversely affected by congestion events.

The device may receive via a first transport layer connection a first indication of network congestion in any manner step . The indication of network congestion may comprise any congestion indication as described herein. In some embodiments the device may receive a plurality of congestion indications. In these embodiments the plurality of congestion indications may be received via one or more of the plurality of connections.

The device may then select according to the assigned priorities a second transport layer connection of the plurality of connections step . In some embodiments the device may select the transport layer connection having the lowest assigned priority. In other embodiments the device may select the connection with the lowest assigned priority that is also transmitting data over the same network over which the congestion event was received. In this embodiment the appliance may select a connection which is indirectly transmitting data over the same network over which the congestion event was received. For example in the appliance selected connection even though may not directly communicate over the network used by connection . However data sent over connection is then sent across connection which may uses the same network as connection and thus selecting connection may produce the desired result of reducing traffic over network

In one embodiment the device may select a connection with a lowest assigned priority relative to current bandwidth usage step . In this embodiment the goal may be to identify a low priority connection which is consuming a large amount of bandwidth and is perhaps a partial cause of a received congestion event. For example the device may select a connection with a priority below a given threshold but transmitting in excess of a second given threshold. In this example a device may select a connection with a priority below a threshold of critical which is transmitting in excess of a threshold of 2 Mb sec. Or the device may select the lowest priority connection which is transmitting in excess of a given bandwidth threshold. In still another embodiment the device may select a connection using the greatest amount of bandwidth.

In some embodiments the device may select a connection which is transmitting the most in excess of an assigned bandwidth. For example if three connections are each allocated 4 Mb sec and a congestion event is received via a first of the connections the device may select the connection which is transmitting most in excess of the 4 Mb sec threshold to transmit a congestion indication. The device may select the connection which is transmitting most in excess either in absolute terms of bits per second or in percentage terms. For example if three connections are assigned bandwidths of 1 Mb sec 2 Mb sec and 10 Mb sec the device may select the connection exceeding its assigned bandwidth by the highest percentage.

In some embodiments the device may also consider whether a connection has received another recent congestion indication in the selecting of a connection to receive a subsequent congestion indication. In one of these embodiments an appliance may remove from consideration any connections which have received a congestion indication within the last round trip time RTT either generated by the device or from another source. In this embodiment the device may select the connection transmitting most in excess of its assigned bandwidth that has not received a congestion indication within the last RTT. In some embodiments a device may maintain a list queue or other data structure to record the congestion indications received and allocated among the connections. In some of these embodiments a device may utilize a round robin or other algorithm to distribute congestion indications among the connections.

After selecting a connection step the device may transmit via the selected connection an indication of network congestion in any manner. In some embodiments the device may transmit an indication that a packet has been dropped. In other embodiments the device may transmit a packet or packets with marked ECN bits.

The device may squelch drop ignore rewrite or otherwise handle the received congestion indication in order to conceal the indication form the intended recipient. For example if the received congestion indication was a packet with marked ECN bits the device may unmark the ECN bits before forwarding the packet to the recipient. Or for example if the received congestion indication was an indication of a dropped packet the device may retransmit the dropped packet without notifying the original sender of the packet.

In some embodiments the device may in response to a single received congestion indication transmit multiple congestion indications. In these embodiments the device may select a third connection to receive a congestion event using any of the criteria used to select the second connection. For example if a congestion indication is received via a high priority connection the device may transmit congestion indications out via two lower priority connections to create a reduction in subsequent bandwidth usage of the lower priority connections sufficient to alleviate the network congestion. This example may be appropriate in cases where the two lower priority connections are transmitting at lower rates relative to the higher priority connection.

Referring now to a system for providing quality of service levels to transport connections using a transparent proxy to control connection bandwidth is shown. In some ways the system is similar to the system of in that an appliance uses congestion indications to control bandwidth usage among a plurality of connections. However in the appliance does not necessarily wait for an incoming congestion indication to arrive before sending out a congestion event. Rather the appliance may transmit a congestion indication as soon as the appliance detects that a connection is exceeding an assigned bandwidth.

Still referring to now in greater detail a number of clients communicate with a number of servers via an appliance . The clients may be connected to the appliance by any means including a LAN WAN MAN or any other network or combination of networks. In some cases the clients may each be connected to the appliance via one or more other appliances. For example the clients may each reside at a branch office while the appliance and servers are located at a central office. In another example the appliance may be located at the branch office with the clients. The clients may be connected to the appliance via a second appliance located at the branch office. Although the figure depicts a plurality of clients the systems and methods described may also be applied to cases in which a single client is communicating over a plurality of connections to one or more servers.

The servers may be connected to the appliance by any means including a LAN WAN MAN or any other network or combination of networks. The system and methods described may also be applied to cases in which a single server is communicating over a plurality of connections to one or more clients.

In some embodiments the appliance may be serving as a proxy for the connections . In other embodiments the appliance may be serving as a transparent proxy for the connections. The appliance may be providing caching acceleration or any other network services with respect to the connections. In one embodiment the connections may comprise TCP connections. In other embodiments the connections may comprise any other transport layer protocol.

In the system shown the appliance comprises a flow controller which determines when a connection is exceeding an assigned bandwidth. The flow controller then induces a congestion event in the connection in the hopes of causing a sender of the connection to reduce their bandwidth. This process will be described in greater detail with respect to .

Referring now to a method for providing quality of service levels to transport connections using a transparent proxy to control connection bandwidth is shown. In brief overview the method comprises determining by an appliance serving as a transparent proxy for a transport layer connection between a sender and a receiver that the rate of transmission of the sender via the transport layer connection differs from a predetermined rate of transmission step . The appliance may then generate in response to the determination an acknowledgement packet containing an indication to alter the rate of transmission step and transmit the generated acknowledgement step .

Still referring to now in greater detail an appliance serving as a transparent proxy for a transport layer connection between a sender and a receiver may determine that the rate of transmission of the sender via the transport layer connection differs from a predetermined rate of transmission step in any manner. The rate of transmission may be measured using any metric and over any time interval. In one embodiment an appliance may determine that a connection has exceeded a maximum number of allowable bytes to be transmitted over a given time interval. A time interval may comprise any duration including without limitation 0.1 seconds 0.5 seconds 1 second 2 seconds 3 seconds 5 seconds and 10 seconds. In one embodiment an appliance may determine that a connection is below a maximum number of allowable bytes to be transmitted over a given time interval.

In some embodiments a plurality of connections may each be assigned an identical predetermined rate of transmission. In other embodiments different connections may be assigned different predetermined rates of transmission. Connections may be assigned rates of transmission in any manner including without limitation based on priority past bandwidth consumption protocol source address destination address and connection burstiness. In some embodiments a plurality of connections may be assigned a relative portion of a total known available bandwidth. For example if the appliance is serving as a transparent proxy for a number of connections over a WAN with a known or approximately known capacity each connection traveling over the WAN may be allocated a portion of the total capacity. In this example if four connections are traveling over a WAN with a known bandwidth of 10 Mb sec. each connection may be assigned a predetermined rate of transmission of 2.5 Mb sec. Alternatively one priority connection might be assigned a rate of 6 Mb sec while the three other connections are assigned rates of 2 Mb second. In this example and others the predetermined rate of transmission may be altered as new connections are created or existing connections are stopped.

In some embodiments the predetermined rate of transmission may correspond to a quality of service level for the connection. A quality of service level may be specified in any manner. In some embodiments the appliance may recognize and or utilize any of the quality of service indications used in TCP related or IP related protocols. In other embodiments the predetermined rate of transmission may correspond to a determination that a given connection is transmitting over a WAN or a LAN.

In still other embodiments the appliance may assign a priority to each of a number of connections and then assign predetermined rates of transmission based on the assigned priorities. The priorities may be assigned using any manner including those described above with respect to .

The appliance may generate in response to the determination of step an acknowledgement packet comprising an indication to alter the rate of transmission. The appliance may generate the acknowledgement packet in any manner. In some embodiments the appliance may generate the acknowledgement packet immediately after the determination. In other embodiments the appliance may wait a predetermined time interval before generating the acknowledgement. The appliance may generate this acknowledgement even if there is no acknowledgement from the receiver of the connection. The appliance may use any technique to generate an acknowledgement that is transparent to the sender and receiver of the connection including matching a source address destination address sequence number and or acknowledgement number.

In some embodiments the acknowledgement packet may contain any indication to reduce the sender s rate of transmission. In one embodiment an indication to reduce transmission rate may comprise an acknowledgement containing an indication that a packet was lost. In another embodiment an indication to reduce transmission rate may comprise an acknowledgement comprising marked ECN bits. In still another embodiment an indication to reduce transmission rate may comprise an acknowledgement with an indication for the sender to reduce a window size for the connection. In this embodiment the reduced window size may be different than a window size advertised by a receiver of the connection.

In other embodiments the acknowledgement packet may contain any indication to increase the sender s rate of transmission. In one embodiment this indication to increase the rate of transmission may comprise an acknowledgement with an indication for the sender to increase a window size for the connection. In this embodiment the increased window size may be different than a window size advertised by a receiver of the connection.

In some embodiments an appliance may transmit multiple indications in response to a single determination. For example if a connection is significantly exceeding an allotted bandwidth the appliance may generate and transmit an acknowledgment comprising both an indication of a dropped packet and an indication to decrease window to the sender. In some embodiments an appliance may transmit indications to both endpoints of a connection. This may be appropriate in cases where both parties of a connection are transmitting relatively equal amounts.

In all of the above embodiments an appliance may continue to transmit acknowledgements containing indications to alter transmission rates until a connection begins transmitting within the predetermined rate of transmission. For example an appliance may continue to transmit to a sender indications to reduce window size until the indications have the desired effect of the sender sufficiently reducing their rate of transmission.

Referring now to a system for dynamically controlling bandwidth by a sender of a plurality of transport layer connections according to priorities of the connections is illustrated. In brief overview a client sends data via a client agent to a number of servers . When the client agent receives an indication of a congestion event via one of the connections a flow controller reduces a congestion window of the connection in accordance with a priority assigned to the connection. In this manner higher priority connections may be made less sensitive to congestion events while lower priority connections may be made to respond more rapidly to congestion events. Although the system shown depicts a flow controller on a client agent in other embodiments the flow controller may reside on an appliance server or server agent.

Still referring to now in greater detail a number of protocols such as TCP for example provide mechanisms for reducing transmission of data upon detection of potential network congestion. With respect to TCP these mechanisms may include modifications to the congestion window which dictates the maximum allowed amount of transmitted unacknowledged data. For example TCP Reno and FAST TCP may divided the congestion window in half each time an indication that a packet has been dropped is received. This may result in dramatic reductions in transmitted data upon receiving a packet loss indication. Other protocols may provide for other formulas to use to determine the maximum amount of unacknowledged data given a packet loss event. However in many cases it may be desirable to adjust the formula for responding to congestion events based on the priority of the connection. For example if a number of connections are transmitting over a link with fixed capacity it may be desirable for higher priority connections to reduce their congestion windows more slowly than lower priority connections in response to congestion events. This may allow the higher priority connections to continue transmitting at a relatively higher rate while the bulk of the bandwidth reductions is absorbed by the lower priority connections. This may also allow connections which may benefit from a relatively stable bandwidth such as real time applications to avoid unwanted spikes in performance caused by rapid decreases in congestion windows.

Now referring to a method for dynamically controlling connection bandwidth by a sender of one or more transport layer connections according to a priority assigned to one or more of the connections is shown. In brief overview the method comprises a sender transmitting data via a first transport layer connection the connection having a first congestion window size identifying an amount of data to be transmitted in the absence of an acknowledgement from a receiver step . The sender may receive an indication of a packet loss via the connection step and identify a reduction factor corresponding to the connection step . The sender may then determine a second congestion window size the second congestion window size comprising the first congestion window size reduced by the reduction factor step . The sender may then transmit data according to the second congestion window size step . The sender may comprise any computing device and or software including without limitation a client server client agent server agent and appliance.

Still referring to now in greater detail a device transmits data via a transport layer connection having a first congestion window size step . A congestion window size may comprise any cap limitation or other restriction on the amount of unacknowledged data in flight. For example a sender may stop transmitting new data once the amount of unacknowledged data equals or exceeds the congestion window size. In one embodiment the first congestion window size may be a TCP congestion window size. In some embodiments a device may be transmitting data via a plurality of connections each connection having a congestion window size.

The sender may then receive an indication of a packet loss via the first connection step . The sender may receive this indication via any protocol or protocols. In some embodiments a packet loss indication may comprise one or more duplicate acknowledgements in a TCP connection. In other embodiments a packet loss indication may comprise a timeout or any other indication indicating some likelihood that a packet transmitted by the sender was not received. In still other embodiments the sender may receive an indication of congestion as described above.

The sender may identify a reduction factor corresponding to a priority of the transport layer connection step in any manner. The sender may assign a priority to the transport layer connection using any method including any method described herein. In some embodiments higher priority connections may be identified with lower reduction factors relative to lower priority connections. A reduction factor may comprise any number used to reduce a congestion window size. For example in many TCP implementations the standard reduction factor may be 2 specifying that the congestion window is divided by two for each loss event that occurs. With respect to the method shown a reduction factor may be any number. In one embodiment a reduction factor may be 1. In this embodiment the congestion window size may not be reduced at all if a congestion event occurs. In other examples reduction factors may comprise 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 or 2 or any numbers within that range. In some embodiments reduction factors of less than 2 may be used with respect to higher priority connections. In still other embodiments reduction factors may comprise 2.1 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 or 6 or any numbers within that range. In some embodiments reduction factors of greater than 2 may be used with respect to lower priority connections.

The sender then determines a second congestion window size the second congestion window size comprising the first congestion window size reduced by the reduction factor step . The sender may reduce the congestion window size by the reduction factor in any manner. In some embodiments the sender may divide the first congestion window size by the reduction factor. In other embodiments the sender may subtract the reduction factor from the first congestion window size. In still other embodiments the sender may subtract a constant multiplied by the reduction factor from the congestion window size. For example sender may subtract the maximum segment size multiplied by the reduction factor from the congestion window size. It should be recognized at this point that a reduction factor may be incorporated into any method of altering congestion window size in response to loss events including any of the variants of TCP.

To give a detailed example in one embodiment the sender may divide the first congestion window size by the reduction factor to determine the new congestion window size. In this example the sender may assign a reduction factor of 4 to low priority connections a reduction factor of 2 to normal priority connections and a reduction factor of 1.33 to high priority connections.

The sender may then transmit via the connection data according to the second congestion window size. In some embodiments the sender may continue to use the method shown such that the congestion window is continually altered as new indications of packet losses are received.

Now referring to a second method for dynamically controlling connection bandwidth by a sender of one or more transport layer connections according to a priority assigned to one or more of the connections is shown. Broadly speaking this method applies the concepts of the systems and methods of to situations in which the congestion window should be increased rather than decreased. In brief overview the method comprises a sender transmitting data via a first transport layer connection the connection having a first congestion window size identifying an amount of data to be transmitted in the absence of an acknowledgement from a receiver step . The sender may then receive no indications of a packet loss during a given time interval step and identify an enlargement factor corresponding to the connection step . The sender may then compute a second congestion window size the second congestion window size computed with respect to the first congestion window size and the enlargement factor step . The sender may then transmit data according to the second congestion window size step . The sender may comprise any computing device and or software including without limitation a client server client agent server agent and appliance.

Still referring to now in greater detail a device transmits data via a transport layer connection having a first congestion window size step . In some embodiments a device may be transmitting data via a plurality of connections each connection having a congestion window size. In one embodiment the transport layer connection may comprise a TCP connection.

The sender may then receive no indications of a packet loss via the first connection during a time interval step . The time interval may comprise any time interval. In one embodiment the time interval may comprise a fixed amount of time including without limitation 0.05 seconds 0.1 seconds 0.2 seconds 0.4 seconds 0.5 seconds 1 second or 2 seconds. In other embodiments the time interval may correspond to a property of the connection. In one embodiment the time interval may correspond to a round trip time of the connection. In another embodiment the time interval may correspond to an average round trip time of the connection. In still other embodiments the time interval may correspond to a multiple of a round trip time or average round trip time.

The sender may identify an enlargement factor corresponding to a priority of the transport layer connection step in any manner. The sender may assign a priority to the transport layer connection using any method including any method described herein. In some embodiments higher priority connections may be identified with higher enlargement factors relative to lower priority connections. An enlargement factor may comprise any number used to increase a congestion window size. For example in some TCP implementations the enlargement factor may be the maximum packet size for the connection specifying that the congestion window is increased by the maximum packet size each time a time interval the round trip time passes without a loss event. In other TCP implementations the enlargement factor may include a minimum round trip time divided by the most recent round trip time. With respect to the method shown an enlargement factor may be any number. In one embodiment an enlargement factor may be 0. In this embodiment the congestion window size may not be increased at all if a congestion event occurs. In other examples enlargement factors may comprise 0.1 0.5 0.75 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 or 2 or any numbers within that range. In still other embodiments reduction factor may comprise 2.1 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 or 6 or any numbers within that range. In some embodiments enlargement factors of less than 1 may be used with respect to lower priority connections. In some embodiments enlargement factors of greater than 1 may be used with respect to higher priority connections.

The sender then determines a second congestion window size the second congestion window size computed with respect to the first congestion window size and the enlargement factor step . The sender may use the enlargement factor to compute the second congestion window size in any manner. In some embodiments the sender may multiply the first congestion window size by the enlargement factor. In other embodiments the sender may add the enlargement factor to the first congestion window size. In still other embodiments the sender may add a constant multiplied by the enlargement factor to the congestion window size. For example the sender may add the maximum segment size multiplied by the enlargement factor to the congestion window size. In other embodiments the sender may also incorporate one or more round trip time calculations into the computation. For example the sender may set the second congestion window size equal to EF MPS CWND OLD MIN RTT LAST RTT where EF is the enlargement factor MSS is the maximum packet size CWND OLD is the previous congestion window size and MIN RTT and LAST RTT are the minimum and last round trip times of the connection respectively.

It should be recognized at this point that an enlargement factor may be incorporated into any method of altering congestion window size in response to loss events including any of the variants of TCP. In some embodiments the above method may be applied to alter the behavior of TCP slow start methods. For example the initial congestion windows allocated to connections during the slow start phase may be determined with respect to the priorities of the connections. In this example a low priority connection might start with an initial congestion window of 1 while a high priority connection might start with a congestion window of 4.

To give a detailed example in one embodiment the sender may add the enlargement factor multiplied by the maximum packet size to the previous congestion window size. In this example the sender may assign an enlargement factor of 0.5 to low priority connections an enlargement factor of 1 to normal priority connections and an enlargement factor of 2 to high priority connections.

The sender may then transmit via the connection data according to the second congestion window size. In some embodiments the sender may continue to use the method shown such that the congestion window is continually altered as new indications of packet losses are received.

In some embodiments the methods described in may be used in conjunction on one or more connections. To give an example a WAN optimization appliance serving as a transparent proxy to a number of connections may assign priorities to each of the connections and corresponding enlargement and reduction factors. In this example the priorities and enlargement and reduction factors may be chosen with respect to the latency of each of the connections. Since typical TCP connections may take longer to speed up as latency increases the appliance may counter this by assigning higher enlargement factors to higher latency connections. Along these lines the appliance may detect which of a number of connections are traveling over a WAN and increase the enlargement factors of those connections accordingly. The appliance may also assign smaller reduction factors to high latency connections since they will be slower to recover from any sudden decrease in congestion window size. These smaller reduction factors may also reflect the fact that with high latency connections it more be more likely that transient congestion will have already passed by the time any indications of the dropped packets arrive. The device may thus be able to balance the respective bandwidths of connections having a variety of latencies using the enlargement and reduction factors.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
