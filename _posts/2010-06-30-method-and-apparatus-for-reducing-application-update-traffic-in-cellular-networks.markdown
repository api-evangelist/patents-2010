title: Method and apparatus for reducing application update traffic in cellular networks
abstract: An application proxy is disposed between a user device and an application server. The application server supports an application that is available on the user device. The user device registers with the application proxy for the application. The user device is prevented from transmitting application update request messages to the application server. The application proxy transmits application update request messages to the application server on behalf of the user device. The application proxy receives application update response messages from the application server. The application proxy determines, based on the application update response messages from the application server, whether to send an application update notification message toward the user device. In this manner, application update traffic normally transmitted via the network between the user device and the application proxy is reduced. The application update request and response messages may be polling messages, keep-alive messages, and the like.

The invention relates generally to cellular networks and more specifically but not exclusively to reducing application update traffic in cellular networks.

As more and more users register for and use mobile services and new applications requiring high speed data delivery are deployed bandwidth requirements for cellular networks continue to grow. Unfortunately while the capacity of cellular networks is increasing the existing capacity is insufficient to meet the growing demand for bandwidth. In many cellular networks in order to better utilize the existing capacity of the cellular networks and thus improve user experience for users accessing mobile services traffic redundancy elimination schemes are being used to reduce the amount of redundant traffic transported within the cellular networks. Disadvantageously however existing traffic redundancy elimination schemes fail to address many of the types of redundant traffic currently transported via wireless networks.

Various deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by embodiments for reducing application update traffic in cellular networks.

In one embodiment an application proxy is disposed between a user device and an application server. The application server supports an application that is available on the user device. The user device registers with the application proxy for the application. The user device is prevented from transmitting application update request messages to the application server. The application proxy transmits application update request messages to the application server on behalf of the user device. The application proxy receives application update response messages from the application server. The application proxy determines based on the application update response messages from the application server whether to send an application update notification message toward the user device. In this manner application update traffic normally transmitted via the network between the user device and the proxy server is reduced. The application update request messages and response messages may be polling messages keep alive messages and the like.

In one embodiment a method for reducing application update traffic in a network includes transmitting an application update request message from an application proxy toward an application server on behalf of a user device receiving an application update response message of the application server at the application proxy and determining based on the application update response message whether to transmit an application update notification message toward the user device. The application update request and response messages are associated with an application supported by the application server and available on the user device.

In one embodiment a method for reducing application update traffic in a network includes preventing at a user device transmission of an application update request message that would normally be transmitted from the user device to an application server for an application supported by the application server and available on the user device.

To facilitate understanding identical reference numerals have been used where possible to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.

An application update traffic reduction capability is depicted and described herein. The application update traffic reduction capability is adapted for reducing application update traffic transported within cellular networks thereby reducing traffic volume within cellular wireless networks and thus increasing bandwidth of the cellular networks available for supporting other types of traffic e.g. user content control signaling and the like . In this manner the application update traffic reduction capability improves the quality of experience for all users. Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to use of the application update traffic reduction capability to reduce application update traffic in cellular networks the application update traffic reduction capability may be used to reduce application update traffic in other types of networks e.g. other types of wireless networks wireline networks and the like .

As depicted in MD accesses and utilizes applications supported by ASs where communication between MD and ASs is supported via RAN and IPN .

The MD is a mobile device configured for accessing and utilizing applications via a cellular communication system. The MD may be any device that is suitable for accessing and utilizing applications via a cellular communication system such as a smartphone a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular phone a computer and the like.

The MD supports a plurality of client applications collectively client applications including a plurality of client notification application programming interfaces APIs collectively client notification APIs respectively.

The client applications include application functionality adapted for enabling the MD to run a plurality of applications hosted by ASs respectively. The typical operation of client applications for utilizing applications hosted by ASs respectively will be understood by one skilled in the art.

The client notification APIs are adapted for supporting application update communications between client applications and ASs respectively. The application update communications typically exchanged between client notification APIs and ASs respectively in the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability will be understood by one skilled in the art.

As described herein in various embodiments of the application update traffic reduction capability client applications may be configured in a manner adapted for reducing the amount of application update traffic that is exchanged between client applications and ASs for the associated applications respectively. In at least some such embodiments the client notification APIs of the client applications respectively may be configured in a manner adapted for reducing the amount of application update traffic that is exchanged between client applications and ASs for the associated applications respectively. In one embodiment for example client applications are configured to prevent initiation of application update request messages to ASs as application update request messages will be initiated by the AP on behalf of the MD .

The operation of client applications and associated client notification APIs in providing various functions of the application update traffic reduction capability may be better understood by way of reference to .

The ASs include application servers that host applications which may be accessed and utilized by MD as well as various other devices .

As described herein the MD accesses and utilizes applications hosted by ASs . The applications hosted by ASs and accessed and utilized by the user via MD may include any applications for which use of the application update traffic reduction capability is suitable. For example the applications may include email applications Internet poll applications e.g. applications that poll for news updates stock tickers and the like instant messaging IM applications social networking applications e.g. Facebook Twitter and the like Really Simple Syndication RSS applications persistent connection applications e.g. virtual private network VPN applications mobility applications and like applications associated with maintaining persistent network connections and the like as well as various combinations thereof. The hosting of such applications on ASs and typical accessing and utilization of such applications via MD will be understood by one skilled in the art.

As depicted in communication between MD and ASs is provided using cellular communication network technologies including RAN and IPN .

The RAN and IPN include any suitable radio access networks and IP networks respectively. As such RAN and IPN may be implemented using any suitable cellular technologies such as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Universal Mobile for Telecommunications Systems UMTS Worldwide Interoperability of Microwave Access WiMAX and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a CDMA wireless communication network RAN includes network elements typically deployed within CDMA based RANs e.g. base stations BS providing a wireless interface for MD one or more Radio Network Controllers RNCs and the like and IPN includes network elements typically deployed for interfacing the RAN to the Internet e.g. one or more Packet Data Serving Nodes PDSNs connected to the RNC s of RAN a Home Agent HA connected to the PDSN s and the like .

In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a Third Generation 3G UMTS wireless communication network RAN includes network elements typically deployed within 3G UMTS based RANs e.g. NodeBs providing a wireless interface for MD one or more Radio Network Controllers RNCs and the like and IPN includes network elements typically deployed for interfacing the RAN to the Internet e.g. one or more Serving GPRS Support Nodes SGSNs connected to the RNC s of RAN a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN connected to the SGSN s and the like .

In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a Fourth Generation 4G UMTS wireless communication network e.g. Long Term Evolution LTE network RAN includes network elements typically deployed within 4G LTE based RANs e.g. eNodeBs providing a wireless interface for MD one or more Serving Gateways SGWs one or more Mobility Management Entities MMEs and the like and IPN includes network elements typically deployed for interfacing the RAN to the Internet e.g. one or more PDN Gateways PGW connected to the SGW s MME s of RAN and the like .

In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a WiMAX wireless communication network RAN includes network elements typically deployed within WiMAX based RANs e.g. base station BSs providing a wireless interface for MD one or more Access Service Network Gateways ASN GWs and the like and IPN includes network elements typically deployed for interfacing the RAN to the Internet e.g. one or more Home Agents HAs connected to the ASN GW s of RAN and the like .

The typical configuration of such wireless communication networks will be understood by one skilled in the art.

Although primarily described with respect to utilizing the application update traffic reduction capability within specific types and configurations of cellular communication networks it will be appreciated that the application update traffic reduction capability may be utilized within various other types and or configurations of cellular communication networks.

As described herein the MD typically accesses and utilizes the applications hosted by the ASs by exchanging application traffic with ASs via RAN and IPN .

The application traffic may include traffic such as application login messages e.g. messages exchanged between MD and ASs for enabling the user to login to the associated applications using MD application content request messages e.g. messages initiated by MD to ASs for requesting content from the ASs and application content e.g. application content provided from ASs to MD to provide application content to the user of the MD such as application content pushed by the ASs to MD and or provided by the ASs to MD in response to application content requests received from MD and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The application traffic also may include for at least some types of applications application update traffic. In general application update traffic of an application for a client application of MD includes traffic adapted enabling the client application of MD to learn the current state of the application for the associated user thereby enabling the client application of MD to remain or become synchronized with the application hosted on the associated AS .

It will be appreciated that the types of application traffic exchanged for applications may vary across applications.

As described herein in various embodiments of the application update traffic reduction capability AP is configured such that at least a portion of the application traffic that is typically exchanged between MD and ASs is instead exchanged between AP and AS with AP handling such application traffic exchanges on behalf of MD . In one embodiment AP is configured such that at least a portion of the application update traffic that is typically exchanged between MD and ASs is instead exchanged between AP and AS with AP handling the application update traffic exchanges on behalf of MD .

The types of application update traffic used for enabling the client application of the MD to learn the current state of the application may vary across applications.

For example application update traffic may include traffic associated with application polling whereby an AS is polled using application polling messages for determining whether there is any new content available for the client application of the MD at the AS e.g. for e mail applications Internet poll applications social network applications RSS applications and the like .

For example application update traffic may include traffic associated with application keep alive messaging whereby application keep alive messages are initiated to an AS for maintaining a current connection between MD and AS such that the current connection between MD and AS does not time out e.g. for IM applications VPN applications mobility applications and any other applications for which connections between clients and servers should be maintained .

In one embodiment the application keep alive messages may be initiated to AS for indicating to a middle box device that the state of the connection between MD and AS should be maintained by the middle box device where the middle box device is located between the MD and the AS .

In general for example for a connection between a client and a server when the client and or the server is behind a middle box device the client and server may need to exchange keep alive messages in order to maintain the state of the connection. In some cases the middle box device creates a state for the connection where the connection has a timer associated therewith and the state of the connection is removed after the connection becomes idle for some period of time. In some cases in order to prevent removal of connection states and thus keep connections active dummy keep alive messages are periodically exchanged between the client and server in order to reset the timers in the middle boxes. For example typical values of state timeout ranges include 30 to 80 seconds for UDP connections 30 60 minutes for TCP connections and the like.

As depicted in an exemplary middle box device is disposed between MD and AS . More specifically middle box device is disposed between IPN and AS . The middle box device may be any suitable type of middle box device e.g. a Network Address Translation NAT device a stateful firewall or any other middle box device which may depend on the type of application with which the middle box device is used. Although a single middle box device is depicted it will be appreciated that one or more of the other ASs may have middle box devices associated therewith.

The application keep alive messages may be initiated to the AS for indicating to the AS that a connection should be maintained on AS for the user.

The application keep alive messages may be initiated to AS both for indicating to middle box device that the state of the connection between MD and AS should be maintained by the middle box device and for indicating to the AS that a connection should be maintained on AS for the user.

The application update traffic may include traffic associated with any other suitable types of application update capabilities.

The application update traffic includes application update messages which may include application update request messages and application update response messages.

An application update message for an application in general is a message adapted for use in enabling the client application on the MD to become or remain synchronized with the AS supporting the application with which the application update message is associated e.g. for enabling the MD to determine whether or not there is new application content available at the AS for the MD in the case of application polling to enable the MD to maintain a connection between the AS and the MD such that the connection does not time out in the case of application keep alive and the like as well as combinations thereof .

An application update request message associated with an application of the MD is a request initiated to an AS for requesting an update of the state of the application on the AS for the MD .

In one embodiment for example an application update request message may include an application polling request message initiated in order to poll the AS for determining whether there is any new application content available for the client application of MD . In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the application polling request message would be initiated by the MD . In embodiments in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used the application polling request message is initiated by the AP on behalf of the MD .

In one embodiment for example an application update request message may include an application keep alive request message initiated in order to indicate that the state of the connection between the MD and the AS should be maintained. In one embodiment the application keep alive request message may be initiated to a middle box device located between the AP and the AS e.g. middle box device located between MD and AS in order to indicate to the middle box device that the state of the connection between the MD and the AS should be maintained by the middle box device. In one embodiment the application keep alive request message may be initiated to the AS in order to indicate to the AS that the state of the connection between the MD and the AS should be maintained by AS . In one embodiment one or more application keep alive request messages may be initiated indicate to both the middle box device and the AS that the state of the connection between the MD and the AS should be maintained. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the application keep alive request message would be initiated by the MD . In embodiments in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used the application keep alive request message is initiated by the AP on behalf of the MD .

An application update response message associated with an application of MD is a response initiated from an AS in response to an application update request message associated with the MD . The application update response message is adapted for indicating the state of the application on the AS for the client application of the MD .

In one embodiment for example an application update response message may include an application polling response message initiated by an AS for the MD which is indicative of whether or not there is new application content available at the AS for the MD . In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the application polling response message initiated by an AS would be propagated to the MD . In embodiments in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used the application polling response message is received by the AP and processed by AP on behalf of the MD .

In one embodiment for example an application update response message may include an application keep alive response message initiated by an AS for the MD which is indicative of whether or not the connection is active at the AS for the MD . In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the application keep alive response message initiated by an AS would be propagated to the MD . In embodiments in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used the application keep alive response message is received by the AP and processed by AP on behalf of the MD .

The use of such application update messages may be better understood by considering examples associated with specific applications which may be hosted by ASs and accessed and utilized by respective client applications of MD .

As an example consider an email application. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the email server for determining whether there are any new emails available for the user of MD . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the email server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are any new emails available for the user of MD .

As an example consider an Internet poll application providing news updates. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the news update server for determining whether there are changes to the news information last provided to the user of MD . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the news update server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are changes to the news information last provided to the user of MD .

As an example consider an IM application. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the IM server for determining whether there are any changes associated with any of the contacts on the contact list of the user of MD e.g. new contacts logging in contacts logging out changes to status messages of contacts and the like as well as various combinations thereof . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the IM server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are any changes associated with any of the contacts on the contact list of the user of MD .

As an example consider a social networking application such as Facebook. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the Facebook server for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD e.g. contacts coming online and going offline changes to news feeds and other types of feeds and the like as well as various combinations thereof . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the Facebook server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD .

As an example consider a social networking application such as Twitter. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the Twitter server for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD e.g. for new Tweets published in the account of the user and like information . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the Twitter server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD .

As an example consider an RSS application. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically polls the RSS server for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD e.g. for new news feeds available to the user and like information . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP periodically polls the RSS server on behalf of MD for determining whether there are changes to the content available to the user of MD .

As an example consider a VPN application in which a middle box device is used. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically sends keep alive messages to the VPN server such that 1 the middle box device located between the MD and the VPN server maintains the state of the connection between the user of MD and the VPN server and 2 the VPN server maintains the VPN connection for the user of MD . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP which is located between MD and the middle box device e.g. middle box device between MD and AS periodically sends keep alive messages to the VPN server on behalf of MD such that 1 the middle box device which is located between the AP and the VPN server maintains the state of the connection between the user of MD and the VPN server and 2 the VPN server maintains the VPN connection for the user of MD . The keep alive messages may be UDP keep alive messages or other suitable types of keep alive messages.

As an example consider a mobility application e.g. MobileIP Interactive Protocol for Mobile Networking IPMN and the like in which a middle box device is used. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability the associated client application of MD periodically sends keep alive messages to the mobility server such that 1 the middle box device which is located between the MD and the mobility server maintains the state of the connection between the user of MD and the mobility server and 2 the mobility server maintains the connection for the user of MD . In one embodiment in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used AP located between the MD and the middle box device e.g. middle box device between MD and AS periodically sends keep alive messages to the mobility server on behalf of MD such that 1 the middle box device located between the AP and the mobility server maintains the state of the connection between the user of MD and the mobility server and 2 the mobility server maintains the connection for the user of MD . The keep alive messages may be UDP keep alive messages or other suitable types of keep alive messages.

In each of the foregoing examples associated application update response messages are propagated from the AS receiving the application update request message. In the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability such application update response messages are propagated to the MD . In embodiments in which the application update traffic reduction capability is used such application update response messages are propagated to AP which processes the application update response messages on behalf of MD .

As will be appreciated the foregoing examples describe application update traffic only for a single mobile device. Thus considering the number of mobile devices currently utilizing applications via cellular communication networks and further the number of applications currently accessible to mobile devices via cellular communication networks it will be appreciated that the existing cellular communication networks are supporting a high volume of application update traffic. It will be further appreciated that many application update request messages may be initiated by mobile devices at times at which no new application content is available such that many of application update request messages initiated by mobile devices produce a large amount of redundant traffic within cellular communication networks and in particular within the associated RANs serving the cellular communication networks.

As described herein within the context of cellular communication network reductions in such application update traffic may be realized through use of AP .

As described herein in various embodiments of the application update traffic reduction capability AP performs functions such as registering applications of MD at AP registering applications of MD with ASs on behalf of MD initiating application update request messages to ASs on behalf of applications of MD monitoring for application update response messages from ASs on behalf of applications of MD notifying applications of MD in response to receiving application update response messages indicative of changes to the application status for the user at the AS e.g. indications of new application content being available for the MD on ASs indications as to whether or not a connection is still active and so forth and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In one embodiment the AP is configured to provide such functions on a per application basis. In one such embodiment as depicted in the AP includes a plurality of network application APIs collectively network application APIs associated with ASs respectively. The network application APIs are adapted for supporting the application update traffic reduction capability for applications of client applications of MD and ASs respectively and thus the network application APIs are adapted for reducing the amount of application update traffic that is exchanged between client notification APIs of client applications and ASs respectively.

For example for each of the foregoing examples regarding application update request response messages exchanged between MD and ASs in the absence of the application update traffic reduction capability it will be appreciated that AP will eliminate transport of virtually all or at least a significant portion of the application update request messages within RAN and will eliminate a significant portion of the application update response messages within RAN thereby freeing bandwidth of the RAN which may then be used for transporting other types of traffic.

The operation of AP and associated network application APIs in providing various functions of the application update traffic reduction capability may be better understood by way of reference to .

In one embodiment AP may be deployed on one or more of the existing network elements of cellular communication system .

In one such embodiment AP may be deployed at the first network element in the direction along the path from MD to ASs at which IP is available.

In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a CDMA wireless communication network AP may be deployed on the PDSN. In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a 3G UMTS wireless communication network AP may be deployed on the SGSN or the GGSN. In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a 4G UMTS wireless communication network e.g. an LTE network AP may be deployed on the MME and or SGW. In one embodiment for example in which RAN and IPN are implemented as a WiMAX wireless communication network AP may be deployed on the ASN.

The AP may be deployed on one or more of the existing network elements of cellular communication system in any other suitable manner.

In one embodiment as depicted in AP may be deployed as a standalone element within cellular communication system . In such embodiments AP may be deployed at any suitable location s within the cellular communication system . In one embodiment for example AP may be deployed within the communication path between MD and ASs . In one embodiment for example AP may be deployed such that it is associated with one or more of the network elements typically forming the path between the MD and the ASs . The AP may be deployed as a standalone element in any other suitable manner.

As depicted in AP is depicted generally as being deployed between RAN and IPN which is indicative that AP may be deployed at any location suitable for reducing application update traffic such as within RAN e.g. at the edge of the RAN near or closest to IPN within IPN e.g. at the edge of the IPN closest to RAN or even further within the IPN and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

Although depicted and described as being a standalone element the AP may be implemented on any of the existing elements of the wireless communication network in which AP is deployed. Furthermore although depicted and described as being a single element AP may be deployed in a distributed manner with various functions of AP being physically distributed across multiple physical elements in any suitable manner.

The application registration request is a request of a user of MD to access and use an application. The application is an application that is hosted on the AS and for which MD has an associated client application . The application registration request is sent by a client notification API of the client application that is associated with the application.

The application registration request may be sent in response to any suitable trigger condition e.g. manually in response to a manual request of a user initiated via a user interface of MD automatically in response to launching of the associated application on MD automatically in response to detection of a network connection by MD and the like .

The application registration request includes application registration information suitable for use by the AP in performing functions on behalf of the MD .

In one embodiment for example application registration information may include authorization information adapted for enabling the AP to login to the AS on behalf of the user of MD e.g. the application login and password of the user and or any other suitable authorization information .

In one embodiment for example application registration information may include configuration information adapted for enabling the AP to interact with the AS on behalf of the user which may vary based on factors such as differences in applications difference in user preferences and the like. For example the configuration information may include the polling frequency with which the AP should poll the AS for identifying new application content for the user. For example the configuration information may include indications of the type of information for which the AP should poll the AS e.g. polling for changes to user status polling for changes to news feeds and the like as well as various combinations thereof . For example the configuration information may include the keep alive frequency with which the AP should send keep alive messages to the AS for maintaining a connection with the AS on behalf of the MD . The configuration information may include any other suitable configuration information which may be specified by and or via MD for use by AP in interacting with AS on behalf of MD .

In one embodiment for example the AP registers the user of MD locally on AP . The registration of the user of MD locally on AP may include any suitable actions. For example AP may register the user with a network application API of AP that is associated with the application i.e. the application of the client application on MD and the application server . For example the AP may store at least a portion of the configuration information received in the application registration request e.g. polling frequency keep alive frequency and the like as well as any other information which may be used by AP in interfacing with AS on behalf of MD . As described with respect to step it will be appreciated that in addition to or alternatively to registering the user of MD locally on AP in response to receiving the application registration request the AP may register the user of the MD locally or update a previous registration of the user of the MD locally as part of processing a proxy registration response received at AP from AS at step .

In one embodiment for example the AP generates a proxy registration request adapted for registering the user with the AS . The proxy registration request may include at least a portion of the application registration information included within the application registration request e.g. authorization information for use by AS in authenticating the user for which the AP is sending the proxy registration request at least a portion of the configuration information and the like . The proxy registration request may include any other suitable information which may be provided from AP to AS for use in registering the user of the MD with the AS .

At step AP sends a proxy registration request to AS . The AP sends the proxy registration request to the AS on behalf of the user of MD . In one embodiment the proxy registration request is identical to or at least substantially similar to the application registration request i.e. AP forwards the application registration request to the AS . In one embodiment the proxy registration request is generated by the AP e.g. using at least a portion of the information from the application registration request .

At step AS processes the proxy registration request. The processing of the proxy registration request may include any suitable processing.

In one embodiment the processing of the proxy registration request includes actions that would normally be performed had the AS received an application registration request from MD rather than receiving the proxy registration request from AP on behalf of MD . For example processing of the proxy registration request may include performing authentication of the user based on the authentication information included within the proxy registration request e.g. determining whether the user login and password are valid .

In one embodiment the processing of the proxy registration request includes actions that would not normally be performed had the AS received an application registration request from MD rather than receiving the proxy registration request from AP on behalf of MD . For example processing of the proxy registration request may include configuring locally on the AS information associated with the corresponding network application API of the AP such that AS can then communicate with the network application API of AP for the associated user.

In one embodiment the proxy registration response may include information that would normally be provided to MD had the AS received an application registration request from MD rather than receiving the proxy registration request from AP on behalf of MD . For example the proxy registration response may include an indication as to whether authentication of the user at AS was successful or unsuccessful.

In one embodiment the proxy registration response may include information that would not normally be provided to MD had the AS received an application registration request from MD rather than receiving the proxy registration request from AP on behalf of MD . For example the proxy registration response may include an indication as to whether association of the network application API of AP with the AS on behalf of the user of MD was successful or unsuccessful.

At step AP receives the proxy registration response. The proxy registration response is received by the network application API associated with AS .

In one embodiment for example the AP registers the user of MD locally on AP . For example the AP may register the user with a network application API of AP that is associated with the application i.e. the application of the client application on MD and the application server . For example the AP may store at least a portion of the configuration information received in the application registration request e.g. polling frequency keep alive frequency and the like as well as any other information which may be used by AP in interfacing with AS on behalf of MD and or at least a portion of the information stored in the proxy registration response e.g. session information adapted for use by AP in communicating with AS on behalf of MD and the like . As described with respect to step it will be appreciated that in addition to or alternatively to registering the user of MD locally on AP in response to receiving the proxy registration response the AP may register the user of the MD locally as part of the processing of the application registration request received at AP from MD at step .

In one embodiment for example the AP generates an application registration response adapted for providing to the MD an indication as to whether registration of the user with AP for the application was successful or unsuccessful. The application registration response may include any other suitable information.

At step AP sends an application registration response to MD . In one embodiment the application registration response is identical to or at least substantially similar to the proxy registration response i.e. AP forwards the proxy registration response to the MD . In one embodiment the application registration response is generated by the AP e.g. using at least a portion of the information from the proxy registration response .

At step MD receives the application registration response. The application registration response is received by the client notification API of the client application associated with AS .

In one embodiment in response to a determination from the application registration response that registration of the user for the application was successful MD configures the client application to prevent initiation of application update messages that would normally be initiated by the client application e.g. polling messages keep alive messages and the like thereby reducing the amount of application update traffic that is transported within RAN .

The manner of configuring a client application to prevent initiation of application update messages that would normally be initiated by the client application may vary across applications.

For example in the case of a social networking application such as Twitter the client application is configured to prevent initiation of request messages for determining whether new Tweets have been published in the account of the user.

For example in the case of a VPN application the client application is configured to intercept and drop any UDP keep alive message initiated on MD the IKE protocol may be configured to prevent sending of keep alive messages that would otherwise be sent in accordance with the IKE protocol and the like.

In one embodiment in response to a determination from the application registration response that registration of the user for the application was unsuccessful MD may present an indication that registration was not successful automatically initiate a registration request directly to AS e.g. bypassing use of AP where login to the AS was unsuccessful when the AP was used and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

Although omitted for purposes of clarity it will be appreciated that any suitable type of communications protocols and technologies may be used to transport the various messages depicted and described with respect to .

Although depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the application registration request sent by MD targets the AP in other embodiments the application registration request sent by MD may target AS e.g. where the AP is transparent to MD . In such embodiments the AP may be configured to intercept the application registration request sent by MD such that AP may register with AS on behalf of MD .

Although depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the user is not currently logged into the application at the time at which the application registration request is initiated in other embodiments the user may be logged into the application at the time at which the application registration request is initiated. In such embodiments at least a portion of steps may be omitted i.e. the client application of MD merely registers with the associated network application API of AP such that network application API may then interact with the AS on behalf of MD .

Although omitted for purposes of clarity it will be appreciated that a similar series of steps may be performed for deregistering the application client of MD from AP . The deregistering of the application client of MD from AP may or may not be performed in conjunction with the user logging out of the application i.e. the user may continue to utilize the application but without AP performing functions on behalf of MD .

In this manner AP is configured to perform functions on behalf of MD e.g. sending application update request messages processing of application update response messages and the like and MD is configured to prevent initiation of application update request messages. The operation of MD AP and AS in performing application update functions is depicted and described herein with respect to .

The application update request is adapted for enabling AP to interact with AS on behalf of MD . The application update request is a request associated with an application hosted on AS and available on MD . The application update request is initiated by a network application API of AP . The application update request is initiated by AP such that MD does not have to initiate the application update request thereby eliminating the need for the application update request to be transported via RAN . The application update request is adapted for indicating to AS that the request is associated with the corresponding client application user of MD .

The application update request may be any suitable type of request e.g. an application polling request whereby AP polls AS on behalf of MD for determining whether there is any new content available for MD at AS an application keep alive request whereby AP sends a keep alive message to AS on behalf of MD for maintaining a current connection with the AS such that the current connection does not time out and the like .

The application update request may be initiated in response to any suitable trigger condition e.g. expiration of a polling keep alive timer maintained on AP for that user for that application receipt by AP of a message indicating that the application update request should be initiated and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

At step AS determines an application update status for the user associated with the application update request. The AS determines the user associated with the application update request from information included within the application update request. The application update status may depend on the type of application of AS .

For example for application content polling the application update status may include an indication as to whether or not there is any new content available for the user e.g. since the last application polling request .

For example for application keep alive messaging the application update status may include an indication as to whether or not the connection for the user is still active on AS .

It will be appreciated that the application update status may include other types of statuses depending on factors such as the type of application the preferences of the user for the application and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The application update response is adapted for enabling AP to interact with AS on behalf of MD . The application update response is associated with the application hosted on AS and available on MD i.e. associated with the corresponding application client of MD . The application update response is received by the network application API of AP that initiated the application update request. The application update response is adapted for indicating to AP that the response is associated with the user of MD and optionally that the application update response is associated with the application update request initiated by AP on behalf of the user.

The application update response is processed by AP such that 1 the application update response does not necessarily have to be transported via RAN e.g. unless the application update response is determined to require initiation of an application update notification to MD as in steps thereby reducing application update traffic transported via RAN and 2 the application update response does not necessarily have to be processed by MD e.g. unless the application update response is determined to require initiation of an application update notification to MD as in steps thereby reducing consumption of resources on MD required for enabling MD to utilize the application.

At step a determination is made as to whether to update the user for the application. If a determination is made not to update the user method proceeds to step where method ends. If a determination is made to update the user method proceeds to step .

In one embodiment for example in which application update functions performed by AP are performed for application content polling the determination as to whether or not to update the user is a determination as to whether or not there is any new content available for the user e.g. since the last application polling request . If there is no new content available for the user the user is not updated i.e. method proceeds to step . If there is new content available for the user the user is updated i.e. method proceeds to step .

In one embodiment for example in which application update functions performed by AP are performed for application keep alive messaging the determination as to whether or not to update the user is a determination as to whether or not the connection for the user is still active on AS .

In one such embodiment if the connection for the user is still active on AS then the user is not updated i.e. method proceeds to step where method ends and if the connection for the user is not still active on AS then the user is updated i.e. method proceeds to step . In this case as long as MD does not receive an application update notification from AP MD knows that the connection is still active on AS . In this embodiment the application update traffic is virtually eliminated from the RAN in both directions of transmission since the only application update notification sent to MD is sent when the connection is no longer active .

In another such embodiment if the connection for the user is not still active on AS then the user is not updated i.e. method proceeds to step where method ends and if the connection for the user is still active on AS then the user is updated i.e. method proceeds to step . In this case as long as MD continues to receive application update notifications from AP MD is aware that the connection is still active on AS and when it does not receive an application update message from AP it knows that the connection is no longer active . In this embodiment although application update traffic in the direction from the AP to MD must be transported by RAN the application update traffic is virtually eliminated from the RAN in the direction from the MD to the AP which still provides a significant reduction in the overall application update traffic transported by RAN .

At step AP sends an application update notification to the MD . The application update notification is sent from AP to the MD via RAN . The application update notification is adapted for indicating to the user an update for the user at AS .

In one embodiment for example in which application update functions performed by AP are performed for application content polling the application update notification provides an indication that there is new content available for the user. In one embodiment the new content is provided to the MD in the application update notification thereby ensuring that new content is delivered to the user quickly and further obviating a need for MD to initiate a request to receive the new content and thus further reducing the amount of application update traffic that must be transported by RAN . In one embodiment a subset of the new content is provided to the MD in the application update notification or none of the new content is provided to the MD in the application update notification in which case MD initiates a request to receive the new content available on AS . The request for new content initiated by MD may be initiated in any suitable manner.

In one embodiment for example in which application update functions performed by AP are performed for application keep alive messaging the application update notification may be adapted to provide an indication that the connection is still active or to provide an indication that the connection is no longer active e.g. depending on the type of application update notification scheme that is employed for keep alive messaging as described with respect to step .

At step MD receives the application update notification. The application update notification is received by the client notification API of the client application for which method is being executed.

At step MD processes the application update notification. The client application of MD processes the application update notification. The processing of the application update notification by the client application of MD may depend on one or more factors such as the type of application of the application update notification the type of information included within the application update notification and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In one embodiment for example in which the application update notification is associated with application content polling the application update notification provides an indication that there is new content available for the user. In one embodiment in which the application update notification includes the new content processing of the application update notification includes extracting and presenting the new content via the application interface. In one embodiment in which the application update notification includes only a subset of the new content processing of the application update notification includes extracting and presenting the new content via the application interface and initiating an application content request for obtaining the remainder of the new content available at AS for the user. In one embodiment in which the application update notification does not include any of the new content processing of the application update notification includes initiating an application content request for obtaining the new content available at AS for the user. Other types of processing may be performed either in place of or in addition to the described processing types.

In one embodiment for example in which the application update notification is associated with application keep alive messaging the application update notification may provide an indication that the connection is no longer active or an indication that the connection is still active. In one embodiment in which the application update notification provides an indication that the connection is no longer active processing of the application update notification may include one or more of presenting a status message to the user via at least one user interface of MD presenting an option for enabling the user to manually select re initiation of a connection with AS automatically re initiating a connection with AS e.g. via AP or bypassing AP and the like as well as various combinations thereof. In one embodiment in which the application update notification provides an indication that the connection is still active processing of the application update notification may include one or more of ignoring the application update notification updating status information associated with the connection presenting status information associated with the connection via at least one user interface of MD and the like as well as various combinations thereof. Other types of processing may be performed either in place of or in addition to the described processing types.

Although depicted and described as ending for purposes of clarity it will be appreciated that the method may continue to be repeated. For example as long as the client application of MD remains registered with the associated network application API of AP and the network application API of AP remains registered with the AS on behalf of MD AP continues to send application update requests to AS i.e. method is repeated for each application update request initiated by AP on behalf of MD . In this manner MD continues to be provided with the latest application status information for the application for which method is performed.

Although omitted for purposes of clarity it will be appreciated that for at least some applications that utilize keep alive messages and for which a middle box device is present between AP and AS the application update request steps and application update response steps also will traverse the middle box device and thus may be used to indicate to a middle box device that the state of the connection between MD and AS should be maintained by the middle box device. In such embodiments updating of the MD based on the application update response e.g. steps may be performed in a manner similar to updating of the MD described herein when the keep alive messages are used for maintaining the connection on the AS .

In one embodiment the network application APIs for an application e.g. where multiple network application APIs are deployed on multiple networks for a given AS are configured to support application state migration such that the application update traffic reduction capability is not impacted by the mobility of the users. In one such embodiment for example a network application API of an AP that is deployed in a particular network is configured to periodically broadcast discovery messages adapted for use in identifying users that are registered with the network application API of the AP that is deployed in the network but which are not currently located on that network in which the AP is deployed i.e. for identifying any users that now have wireless access through other networks while still being registered with the network API of the AP deployed in the network . In one such embodiment upon identification of such a user by the network API i.e. the user is currently located on a different network the network application API transfers the application state of the user to a corresponding network application API on an AP deployed in the different network on which the user is currently located. For example in a CDMA wireless communication network that includes multiple PDSNs the application state of a user may be transferred from one PDSN associated with a RAN previously accessed by the user to another PDSN associated with a RAN currently accessed by the user. For example in a 3G UMTS wireless communication network that includes multiple SGSNs the application state of a user may be transferred from one SGSN associated with a RAN previously accessed by the user to another SGSN associated with a RAN currently accessed by the user. The application state migrations which may be performed in other types of wireless communication networks will be understood by way of reference to the description of . Although primarily described with respect to a single network application API it will be appreciated that such capabilities may be supported by any network application APIs utilized for supporting of any numbers and or types of ASs .

Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which MD is assumed to have a single user using the MD it will be appreciated that in some cases the MD may be used by multiple users. In some cases the multiple users may share one or more of the applications. In some cases the multiple users may access and use one or more of the applications independently from each other. Accordingly it will be appreciated that references herein to functions being performed on behalf of MD may also be and or alternatively be considered to be indicating that functions are performed on behalf of a single user multiple users and the like. It will be appreciated that in the case of multiple users using MD at least some of the functions still may be considered to be performed on behalf of the MD e.g. where certain functions for certain applications are initiated automatically by the MD on behalf of the user s .

Although primarily described with respect to utilizing the application update traffic reduction capability within cellular communication networks it will be appreciated that the application update traffic reduction capability may be utilized within various other types wireless communication networks. Similarly although primarily described with respect to utilizing the application update traffic reduction capability within wireless communication networks it will be appreciated that the application update traffic reduction capability also may be utilized within wireline communication networks.

It will be appreciated that the functions depicted and described herein may be implemented in software hardware and or a combination of software and hardware e.g. using a general purpose computer one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC and or any other equivalents. In one embodiment application update traffic reduction process can be loaded into memory and executed by processor to implement the functions as discussed hereinabove. As such application update traffic reduction process including associated data structures can be stored on a computer readable storage medium e.g. RAM memory magnetic or optical drive or diskette and the like.

It is contemplated that some of the steps discussed herein as software methods may be implemented within hardware for example as circuitry that cooperates with the processor to perform various method steps. Portions of the functions elements described herein may be implemented as a computer program product wherein computer instructions when processed by a computer adapt the operation of the computer such that the methods and or techniques described herein are invoked or otherwise provided.
