The technical field relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to forming an actionable communication resource to facilitate communications with communication devices that are associated with resources assigned by a resource management system.

A resource management system such as a Computer Aided Dispatch CAD system can be used to assign resources in response to an incident event or occurrence. Such resources can include agencies responder units vehicles and responders themselves for example. The resources have one or more communication devices associated therewith that are addressable by a separate communication system such as a two way land mobile radio system to which the communication devices are connected. During the course of the incident a CAD operator may wish to communicate with all or as many of the assigned responders as possible via their communication devices. Such communications can be facilitated using communication methods including but not limited to radio console mechanisms such as Instant Transmit All Points Bulletin APB Transmit Conference Bridge Communication Bridge Audio Bridge Console Patch Communication Channel Patch Communication Group Patch and the like.

However known techniques for communicating with the responders assigned to an incident involve a number of manual operations on the part of the CAD dispatch operator which are cumbersome at best and inaccurate at worst. More particularly the CAD dispatch operators work on the level of dispatch units and lists of responders addressable by the CAD system. The dispatch operators also communicate with those same responders through the separate radio system which uses different responder identities communication group identities and voice enabled device identities.

In addition the communication groups to which the communication devices used by responders are affiliated can change for example depending on whether the responders are on duty or off duty or based on their current task assignment or role what incident they are assigned to etc. Thus the dispatch operator today is not always aware of which communication groups each responder is affiliated with especially in cases of medium to large incidents requiring restructuring of the communication groups and requiring mutual aid resources from outside agencies and especially since there is no one to one mapping between the CAD resource lists and the responders communication groups. There is therefore no easy way to communicate with all of the responders assigned to the incident. Moreover the assigned resources and associated communication devices and communication groups may dynamically change during the incident making a manual process that much more difficult.

Thus there exists a need for a method and system for forming an actionable communication resource to facilitate communications with communication devices that are associated with resources assigned by a resource management system wherein the method minimizes manual activity by an operator of the resource management system.

Thus it will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration common and well understood elements that are useful or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment may not be depicted in order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments.

Generally speaking pursuant to the various embodiments an actionable communication resource forming function performs a method for forming an actionable communication resource in a communication system. The method includes receiving from a resource management system a plurality of resource identifiers that identify a plurality of resources wherein each resource is associated with a communication device addressable by a communication system using a communication device identifier for each resource identifier determining the communication device identifier for the associated communication device for each communication device identifier identifying a communication group to which the corresponding communication device is affiliated and using the identified communication groups to determine a set of communication groups wherein each communication group in the set is addressable by the communication system wherein an actionable communication resource is formed from the set of communication groups to facilitate communications with the communication devices over the communication system using the addressable communication groups. The actionable communication resource can be used by an operator of the resource management system to communicate with the communication devices associated with the assigned resources over the communication system using the addressable communication groups.

An illustrative advantage of the present teachings is the provision of a more straightforward and streamlined mechanism for an operator of a resource management system such as a CAD dispatch operator to initiate communications to all resources e.g. agencies units responders etc. that are assigned to the same incident or event. This mechanism minimizes manual operations by the operator of the resource management system to identify the communication groups used to form the actionable communication resource which is used by the operator to communicate with those assigned resources. In addition dynamic changes during the incident to the assigned resources and to the communication groups associated with those assigned resources for instance are better managed using the present teachings than when using the known techniques. Those skilled in the art will realize that the above recognized advantages and other advantages described herein are merely illustrative and are not meant to be a complete rendering of all of the advantages of the various embodiments.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular a block diagram of a system that implements the forming and using of an actionable communication resource in accordance with some embodiments is shown and indicated generally at . System illustrates a CAD system and a voice communication system. However those skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the specifics of this example are merely illustrative of some embodiments and that the teachings set forth herein are applicable in a variety of alternative settings. For example the teachings described do not depend on the type of resource management system or the type of communication network. As such other alternative implementations using different types of resource management systems and communication networks are contemplated and are within the scope of the various teachings described.

System includes a resource management system which in this case is a CAD system an actionable communication resource forming function which includes an identifier translator function an affiliation tracking function a talkgroup combining function and a communication method determination and transmission function a communication system which includes a network and a network and communication devices and . In general these elements of system are implemented using one or more although not shown memory devices interfaces and processing devices that are operatively coupled and which when programmed form the means for these system elements to implement their desired functionality for example as illustrated by reference to the method shown in .

The interfaces are used for passing information for example in the form of resource lists device identifiers and signaling or messaging e.g. packets datagrams frames superframes or any other information blocks having media or control between the elements of the system . The implementation of the interface in any particular element depends on whether that element is connected to another element in the system or connected to a communication network e.g. networks and . For example the interfaces between two elements within system such as between the CAD system and the communication system can include one or more wired interfaces such as a serial port interface e.g. compliant with the RS 232 standard a parallel port interface an Ethernet interface a USB interface and or a FireWire interface and the like. Interfaces between functional blocks such as blocks and can be internal interfaces if these functional elements are included within the same device.

Where the interfaces support wireless communications such as between the communication devices and the networks and the interfaces comprise elements including processing modulating and transceiver elements that are operable in accordance with any one or more standard or proprietary wireless interfaces wherein some of the functionality of the processing modulating and transceiver elements may be performed by means of the processing device through programmed logic such as software applications or firmware stored on the memory device of the system element or through hardware.

The processing device utilized by the elements of system may be programmed with software or firmware logic or code for performing functionality described by reference to and or the processing device may be implemented in hardware for example as a state machine or ASIC application specific integrated circuit . The memory implemented by these system elements can include short term and or long term storage of various information needed for the functioning of the respective elements. The memory may further store software or firmware for programming the processing device with the logic or code needed to perform its functionality.

We now turn to a brief description of each of the system elements shown in which will aid in the understanding of the later description of the method illustrated in . The present illustrative implementation of system includes the CAD system which is operated by and receives input from a dispatch operator through a user interface commonly referred to as a CAD workstation or CAD terminal In an embodiment the user interface further comprises a communication e.g. voice console that couples to the communication system through a wired interface and the CAD terminal and voice console are coupled using a wired interface and communicate using a console application programming interface. The CAD system uses software access to various servers and the input from the dispatch operator to generate and provide a set or list containing a plurality of resource identifiers. The resource identifiers identify a plurality of resources e.g. agencies units responders devices etc. which in this case were selected for responding to a reported incident or event such as a fire hazardous chemical spill etc. However system is not limited to including a CAD system. Alternatively embodiments of the resource management system could include but are not limited to a work order management system a customer service system or any other system that manages resources and outputs a list of resource identifiers that are ultimately used to form and use an actionable communication resource in accordance with the teachings herein.

The list of resource identifiers is provided to the actionable communication resource forming function to identify a set of communication groups e.g. and to which communication devices e.g. associated with selected resources are affiliated. The term affiliated as used herein is defined as being associated as a member of a communication group thereby having permission or access to receive and listen to communications or media provided to or between the members of the communication group. In this case the communication groups comprise talkgroups e.g. talkgroups A and B which can be identified by talkgroup identifiers. However the communication groups can have any group structure that is addressable and identifiable by the communication system including but not limited to communication channels such as conventional analog or digital channels etc. As used herein a talkgroup is defined as a communication group for voice communications and a communication channel is defined as a medium over which media is transmitted between members of a communication group.

Function comprises multiple logical functions and which perform functionality that is explained in detail below by reference to . The particular device or devices if the functionality is distributed between multiple devices in which the logical functions and are housed depends on the particular system architecture implementation. In some illustrative implementations all or some of the functionality of logical functions and is performed in the CAD system in the voice console in the communication system in a stand alone infrastructure device e.g. a subsystem or controller or some combination of these devices.

The communication system receives an indication e.g. via communication group identifiers of the set of communication groups and an indication e.g. some sort of signal or data of the actionable communication resource that was formed by the communication method determination and transmission function . The communication system then enables through one or more networks communications between the CAD dispatch operator and the communication devices and or communications amongst the devices themselves which are associated with or used by or included within the resources that were dispatched using the CAD system .

In the illustrative system implementation the communication system comprises a voice communication system such as a push to talk PTT dispatch radio system not shown which can be carrier based PTT broadband based PTT two way land mobile radio based PTT etc. which receives the indications of the set of identified communication groups and of the actionable communication resource. The actionable communication resource can take any suitable form to enable the operator to communicate with the devices associated with the assigned resources and or to enable communication amongst the devices including a multiselect MSEL group a Conference Bridge a Communication Bridge an Audio Bridge a Console Patch a Communication Channel Patch a Communication Group Patch and the like for audio distribution via appropriate wireless networks to the identified communication groups that contain the communication devices .

As used herein the terms bridge and patch mean a relationship between communication groups which allows members of those distinct groups to communicate with each other. Think of joining groups A B so that all the members in A and B can now communicate with each other when they could not previously. The term MSEL group means an action by which a dispatcher simultaneously selects multiple communication groups so she can monitor them together and transmit to them together. Note that MSEL allows these joint operations to the dispatcher but does not allow the members of the communication groups to communicate with each other as is provided by Patch . Moreover although voice distribution is illustrated the present teachings can be used to form an actionable communication resource to distribute other media types such as video etc.

The wireless networks include infrastructure devices such as base stations base station controllers not shown and the like depending on the network implementation. Moreover the networks can be configured as a 2G 3G or 4G network using communication technologies including but not limited to Global System for Mobile Communication GSM Code Division for Multiple Access CDMA Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS Wideband Code Division for Multiple Access W CDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access SC FDMA Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing DFT SOFDM Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access IFDMA Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMax Long Term Evolution LTE . These wireless communication technologies enable the utilization of applications including PTT PTT over Cellular PoC Push to X PTX i.e. for communicating voice and or other media such as images or video Project 25 TETRA and other communication technologies. Moreover only two networks and are shown for ease of illustration. However communication system can include any number N and type of networks to support the desired communication methods and desired media transmissions within system .

The communication devices are also referred to in the art as subscribers user equipment access devices access terminals mobile stations mobile subscriber units mobile devices user devices and the like. These communication devices can be any type of communication device such as radios mobile phones mobile data terminals Personal Digital Assistants PDAs laptops two way radios cell phones and any other device capable of operating in a wired or wireless environment and that can be used by public users such as consumers or private users such as public safety users .

Turning now to a flow diagram illustrating a method for forming an actionable communication resource in accordance with some embodiments is shown and generally indicated at . Functionality shown in method can be performed in elements of system including the actionable communication resource forming function the CAD system and the communication system . More particularly at the identifier translator function receives from the resource management function the CAD system a plurality of resource identifiers that identify a plurality of resources wherein each resource is associated with at least one communication device addressable by the communication system using a communication device identifier and the identifier translator function determines for each resource identifier the identifier for the associated communication device.

The manner in which the identifier translator function performs its functionality depends on the resource identifiers supplied by the CAD system . As illustrated in the CAD system provides to the identifier translator function a list of CAD identifiers for users or responders e.g. responder or user IDs for a USER a USER and a USER associated with resources selected for the incident and function determines the communication device IDs e.g. of a voice enabled DEVICE for USER a voice enabled DEVICE for USER and a voice enabled DEVICE for USER for the communication devices used by these responders. Following is an example of how the CAD system generates the CAD resource list and how function translates that list to the list of communication device IDs associated with the assigned resources. Associated in this context means that the communication devices are used by responders called or dispatched to the incident and associated in a more general sense means that the communication devices are designated for use by the resources assigned by the resource management system.

In general when an incident is reported for example via a 911 call information about the incident is provided to the CAD system . The CAD system applies algorithms that use this information to recommend which resources e.g. agencies units responders equipment devices etc. to assign to the incident. These algorithms are based on emergency response plans which are for instance based on type of incident mutual aid agreements responder types roles required at the incident availability of responders availability of devices and equipment that are used by those responders location and distance to the incident etc. In one implementation scenario the CAD dispatch operator reviews the CAD recommendations and selects which resources to assign to the incident. The dispatch operator can automatically accept the CAD recommendations or may decide to select a subset superset or different set of resources to assign to the incident.

More particularly in one illustrative implementation the CAD system provides to the dispatch operator a window pertaining to the incident on her CAD workstation . Within that Incident window is a Resources window where the CAD system provides its recommended list of resources to assign to the incident. At first the Resources window lists an initial set of resources that CAD recommends to assign to the new incident and at a later time as described in more detail below the Resources window shows CAD recommendations for an additional set of resources to add to the ongoing incident for example when the incident grows from a 3 alarm to 4 alarm fire . The dispatch operator reviews the recommended list of resources initial resources or additional resources and may elect using the CAD workstation to follow the CAD recommended list of resources may select a subset or superset of resources based on the CAD recommendations or may select additional or different resources from an available pool of resources.

In one example embodiment once the resources for the incident are assigned the CAD system determines the underlying responders associated with each resource. For each responder function determines in this case the one or more voice enabled devices e.g. radios broadband devices etc. used by that responder and further determines communication groups that are currently affiliated with each of the responders voice enabled devices. For instance determining the communication groups to which the voice enabled devices are affiliated comprises determining a talkgroup or a communication channel such as a conventional voice channel to which the voice enabled devices are affiliated. In this manner the function determines all of the communication groups associated with each of the resources selected by the dispatch operator .

Providing a more detailed implementation for illustrative purposes once the resources for the incident are assigned the CAD system determines at least a list of underlying responders for each selected resource. For example the list of resources is determined based on the type of resource selected. For an agency a list may be generated of all of the responders that are on duty within that particular agency. For a unit within an agency a list may be generated of all of the responders and equipment associated with that particular unit. In addition the CAD system might determine the underlying responders associated with a special task force or with a particular role or set of roles or expertise needed for the emergency response etc. Moreover the list of responders may depend on user logon information to the CAD System device capability information date time and shift assignment presence or status information such as availability location or proximity to the incident etc.

The CAD system provides this list of responders for instance in the form of CAD identifiers for the responders e.g. the USER ID the USER ID and the USER ID as shown in to the identifier translator function to determine for each responder identifier the communication device identifier for each associated communication device. There are a variety of methods that can be used by the identifier translator function to determine responder association with at least one communication device including but not limited to a responder logging in through the device a finger print swipe a bar code swipe device provisioning or configuring user device association input from the communication system to which the communication devices are connected etc. Using one or more of these methods the identifier translator function determines the list of identifiers corresponding to the communication devices e.g. the DEVICE ID for USER DEVICE ID for USER and DEVICE ID for USER as shown in and provides this list to the affiliation tracking function . The communication device identifiers are known to the communication system and used to identify or address the communication devices for the assigned responders.

The affiliation tracking function identifies the communication groups to which each device in the list is affiliated. There are a variety of techniques that can be used by the affiliation tracking function to identify the at least one communication group for each responder s device s . An example technique comprises a communication device reporting to function via the CAD system or via the communication system e.g. using messaging which communication groups are being monitored by that device. Such reporting can be done upon power up upon roaming into or out of the communication system upon roaming between networks within the communication system or at the time of communication group e.g. talkgroup affiliation.

Moreover a mapping of device to communication groups can be a registration based or presence based solution that conveys device affiliation with communication groups or device selection setting or mode setting wherein selection setting or mode setting is mapped to one or more communication groups. The communication device to communication group translation or mapping can be pre configured static or dynamically changed. In addition the one or more communication groups can be configured into the affiliation and tracking function for each communication device a priori i.e. ahead of time and changed in real time through automatic or manual methods. Furthermore the CAD system can use pre configured communication groups to override a current setting on a communication device perhaps in anticipation that the device will be either manually or automatically switched to monitor one or more pre configured communication groups on route to the incident or upon arrival. Any combination of the above described and other techniques can be used by the affiliation tracking function to determine the one or more communication groups associated with each communication device identifier provided by the identifier translation function .

As illustrated in the affiliation tracking function identifies talkgroups A and B to which the communication devices in list are affiliated. The communication devices having the DEVICE ID and the DEVICE ID are affiliated with talkgroup A along with a communication device for a USER having a DEVICE ID . The communication device having the DEVICE ID is affiliated with talkgroup B along with a communication device for a USER having a DEVICE ID . The affiliation tracking function provides an indication e.g. talkgroup identifiers lists of talkgroup members etc. to the talkgroup combining function which uses any suitable algorithm to combine the identified communication groups to generate a set e.g. of communication groups having members to which the dispatch operator will communicate and this algorithm can be based on among other factors the dispatch operator s selected communication method. Each communication group in the set is also identifiable by the communication system for example by communication group identifiers e.g. talkgroup or communication channel identifiers .

In a simple embodiment as illustrated in the talkgroup combining function simply includes in the set of communication groups all of the communication groups identified by the affiliation tracking function . In a further implementation the communication group combining function might also combine the identified communication groups with one or more additional communication groups for example based on policy to the generate the set of communication groups. Likewise the communication group combining function might exclude one or more of the identified communication groups from the set based on policy. For example the communication group combining function may include one or more additional Tactical communication groups or select from a pool of available Tactical communication groups and assign one or more of those Tactical groups to the incident. The communication group combining function might also remove or exclude certain communication groups for instance to prevent certain day to day communication groups from being pulled into the incident group. As stated above function can use any suitable algorithm for combining or otherwise using the identified communication groups to generate or form the set of communication groups.

Function provides the set of communication groups e.g. in the form of communication group identifiers to the communication method determination and transmission function to generate form or add to an existing actionable communication resource to facilitate communications with the communication devices associated with the selected resources over the communication system using the addressable communication groups. More particularly the actionable communication resource is defined as a logical function used to inform or direct a communication system of a selected communication method to be used to facilitate media communications between the operator of the resource management system and the communication devices and or between the communication devices themselves within the set of identified and selected communication groups which was supplied by the talkgroup combining function .

In this case the actionable communication resource is used by the CAD operator to communicate with the assigned responders communication devices using the addressable talkgroups A and B. Accordingly an additional input into the communication method determination and transmission function is a selected communication method. The selected communication method is provided by the CAD system via messaging or is provided directly from the CAD operator via messaging from the CAD workstation . More particularly just as the dispatch operator controls which resources he wants to select for the incident in a further example implementation the dispatch operator can also control the manner in which he communicates with these resources or the manner of communication between the resources by selecting a desired communication method.

For example within the same Incident window as mentioned above is a list of communication methods which can be a complete list of communication methods or a subset of communications methods that pertain to that particular type of incident. Moreover the list is controllable by agency or dispatch policy etc. The dispatch operator can choose a communication method from the list and the indication of this choice and a transmit indication is provided to the communication method determination and transmission function to in this case for instance initiate a voice communication to and or between the set of communication groups using the selected communication method.

In one illustrative implementation the dispatch operator selects High Priority Transmission with talkback i.e. Instant Transmit or High Priority Transmission Out Only i.e. APB Transmit or General Transmit with preceding Alert Tones i.e. ALERT Transmit or builds a new or reuses an existing bridge or Patch Group and transmits on that bridge or Patch Group i.e. Patch Transmit . The dispatch operator may further select a Conference Bridge a Communication Bridge an Audio Bridge a Console Patch an MSEL group a Communication Channel Patch a Communication Group Patch etc.

In addition The dispatch operator may also select a duration for the communication for example temporary e.g. one time use only or persistent e.g. setting up communications immediately and lasting for instance until a specific event occurs a period of time elapses an operator tears it down etc. . These alternative communication method selections can be provided as a list of choices requiring only a single selection multiple selections or additive selections by the dispatch operator or can be configured a priori. Also once there is at least one resource in the CAD System s list of assigned resources for a given Incident then each time the dispatch operator accesses the Incident window he could be offered a selection for all resources currently assigned to incident . This is offered so the dispatch operator can at any time initiate a communication method to all resources assigned to the incident.

Instead of the CAD dispatch operator directly selecting the communication method and providing the indication of the selected communication method to the communication method determination and transmission function the CAD dispatch operator alternatively selects via the CAD workstation one or more underlying attributes for the communication method. Then the CAD system derives the actual communication method and provides an indication of the selected communication method to the communication method determination and transmission function .

For example the CAD dispatch operator selects the type of duration of the communication e.g. temporary or persistent. The CAD dispatch operator further selects a type of floor control desired e.g. transmit out only transmit out and listen patch transmit and conference rules etc. In addition the CAD dispatch operator selects a transmission priority e.g. High Medium Low etc. in case there are multiple dispatch operators competing for the same communication groups. Moreover the attributes from which to choose may include but are not limited to type or location of incident agency or dispatch policy or may be a combination of any of these and other attributes. The CAD system translates the selected options into a specific communication method using pre configured translation rules or an algorithm to derive the communication method etc. and communicates the selection to the communication method determination and transmission function .

Under the control or direction of the actionable communication resource that is formed by the communication method determination and transmission function the communication system performs the selected communication method for the selected set of communication groups. As mentioned above this may involve setting up an MSEL group and performing an APB or General Transmit or setting up a Patch Group and Performing a Patch Transmit for example through the Voice Console API which enables the dispatch operator to communicate to all of the responders communication devices that are assigned to the same incident.

More particularly with respect to the present illustrative implementation when the CAD dispatch operator speaks or otherwise transmits audio or voice to the communication system the media is distributed to the communication groups A and B to which the communication devices of the assigned responders are affiliated. As shown the dispatch operator communicates to talkgroup A having as members DEVICE for responder USER and DEVICE for responder USER over the network and communicates to talkgroup B having as a member DEVICE for assigned responder USER over the network . The communication can be one way from the dispatch operator to the talkgroups A and B or two way between the dispatch operator and the talkgroups A and B depending on the selected communication method.

For some incidents it is necessary for the dispatch operator to communicate with one set of resources separately from another set of resources even though all resources are assigned to the same incident. This can be accomplished for instance by the dispatch operator selecting one set of resources and selecting a communication method that puts those resources into a specific incident group e.g. MSEL or PATCH group and selecting another set of resources and a corresponding communication method that puts the other set of resources into a different incident group e.g. MSEL or PATCH group . Such an arrangement can be used for example to put all fire resources on MSEL and all traffic officers on PATCH . This in effect allows the dispatch operator to create more then one incident group for a particular incident. In the above example all resources assigned to fire group and all resources assigned to traffic group can be added to the list of choices in the Resources window for resource selection prior to selecting a communication method or the communication method itself can imply the grouping such as APB transmit to all resources assigned to fire group .

The function monitors via a signal or message from the communication system and or via the CAD system any changes that occur during the course of the incident or event that may have an impact on the actionable communication resource. Generally such changes can include but are not limited to receiving from the resource management system a modification to the plurality of resource identifiers and modifying the actionable communication resource based on this change or detecting that a particular communication group in the set no longer includes any communication devices associated with resources in the resource list affiliated with this communication group and thereby removing this communication group from the set of communication groups used to form the actionable communication resource or detecting that one of the assigned resources has changed to a different communication device and based on this change modifying the set of communication groups used to form the actionable communication resource or detecting a change of the affiliated communication group for a communication device associated with one of the assigned resources and based on that change modifying the set of communication groups used to form the actionable communication resource or detecting an input from the operator of the resource management system e.g. a change in the selected communication method and accordingly changing the actionable communication resource.

More specific changes might include for example changes to responder status assigned de assigned from an incident etc. changes to responder s communication devices such as changes regarding availability of those devices or regarding affiliated communication groups for those devices changes to communication groups based on the number of assigned and unassigned responders to the incident in those communication groups. As a result of any of these changes the CAD system and the function make necessary adjustments to the list of responders assigned to the incident to the list of associated communication devices and to the set of affiliated communication groups which determines the changes made to the actionable communication resource.

Likewise the present teachings are applicable when new resources are added to support the incident or event. For example the CAD dispatch operator can select via the Resources window provided at the CAD workstation new resources to be assigned to the incident and may further select an appropriate communication method for these new resources or may keep the same communication method for all assigned resources . Then the CAD system determines for each resource the underlying responders. The function determines for each assigned responder an associated communication device and the communication groups to which these devices are currently affiliated. Finally the communication system enables the selected communication method under the direction of the actionable communication resource so that the dispatch operator can provide media communication to those newly assigned responders.

The dispatch operator may wish to send a voice communication to all the responders both initial and new assigned to the incident. There are several different options that can be provided to the dispatch operator to accomplish this. In a first option the dispatch operator may decide while the new responders are still selected from the example above to choose a second communication method to add those new responders to an Incident Patch Group which includes the rest of the responders who were previously assigned to the incident and initiate a Patch Transmit to that entire Incident Patch group. In a second option the dispatch operator can select all resources assigned to same incident before selecting a communication method . This will allow the dispatch operator to initiate an APB Transmit to all responders assigned to same incident or if the dispatch operator selected Patch will allow the dispatch operator to initiate a Patch Transmit to all responders assigned to the same Incident. A third option is to combine these two selection steps into one step to allow the dispatch operator to choose a communication method for all responders assigned to the incident such as Patch Transmit to all responders assigned to incident or to simply imply if there are no new resource selections then selecting a communication method implies all resources previously assigned under that communication method.

The CAD system maintains the list of resources and associated responders assigned to the Incident. Accordingly The CAD system keeps track of all the resources and associated responders assigned to the incident and automatically adds new responders to the list of responders assigned to the incident. So at any time when the dispatch operator chooses a communication method to send a voice communication to either initial resources additional resources resources in a particular incident group or all resources the dispatch operator is able to communicate with those underlying responders devices.

As the emergency response to the incident enters into a final phase and or as responders complete their assigned tasks the responders may be removed or de assigned from the incident. Moreover as the CAD dispatch operator or responders update responder status as available indicating that they are no longer assigned to the incident the CAD system or with the aid of an outside system can keep track of all the responders associated with each communication group and when the last responder in a communication group is de assigned from the incident the function can either automatically remove that communication group from the set of communication groups used to form the actionable communication resource or the CAD system can first query the dispatch operator whether she would like to remove that communication group from the set. This choice may be important and depends for instance on agency or dispatch operations. This choice may impact an Incident Patch group which is actively working or an MSEL group for future APB or other types of Transmissions using the MSEL group and is beneficial should the dispatch operator want to remove those communication groups when responders are no longer working on the incident slowly pruning down the media transmissions to only those communication groups containing active assigned responders on that incident.

Another aspect of the present disclosure is tracking other types of changes that impact communication groups assigned to the incident for example if any of the responders assigned to the incident change their voice enabled devices to a different communication group for example a different talkgroup conventional channel or broadband talkgroup etc. . The function keeps track of the list of associated communication groups assigned to the incident and can adjust that list to include any corresponding new communication groups and examine a current communication group to see if any responders remain in that group in case that was the last responder assigned to the incident to leave that communication group . The function can also query the dispatch operator via the CAD system before adding or removing a communication group or do it automatically depending on agency or dispatch policy. Therefore the next time the dispatch operator initiates a communication method to all responders assigned to the incident the function uses an updated set of communication groups for that incident i.e. function makes sure that the new communication group is included when initiating the selected communication method s for that incident and removes any communication groups that no longer contain responders assigned to the incident .

Regarding whether to keep a particular communication group in the set the function may consider unassigned resources in the calculation of whether to include or exclude a particular communication group in the list of communication groups assigned to the incident. For example the function may decide to keep a communication group assigned to the incident even after all the assigned resources have left the communication group in case the remaining unassigned resources are still working on the incident. Or the function may take into account the location or current assignments of the remaining resources e.g. too far away clearly working on something else etc. and assume they are not working on the incident and remove the communication group when all the assigned resources have left the communication group. The CAD system could also display the list of assigned and unassigned resources for each talkgroup and allow the dispatch operator to choose whether to remove or add a communication group.

In yet another illustrative implementation a dispatcher utilizes a CAD application to initiate a BOLO procedure. In essence this procedure automatically sets in a motion a process where initially all users within a geographic area are alerted via a message to Be On the LookOut BOLO for a suspect. As time goes by and the suspect is not apprehended the BOLO message can automatically be sent to all users within a larger geographic area.

Accordingly CAD dispatcher may wish to communicate with all of the recipients of the BOLO message as determined the CAD system . Using the present teachings the CAD system generates a CAD resource list of CAD identifiers corresponding to the BOLO recipients and using the above described techniques the actionable communication resource function receives these responder identifiers as input and outputs to the communication system the actionable communication resource and the identified set of communication groups to which the recipients devices are affiliated so that the BOLO message can be sent to the recipients via the communications groups in the set.

In the foregoing specification specific embodiments have been described. However one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of present teachings. The benefits advantages solutions to problems and any element s that may cause any benefit advantage or solution to occur or become more pronounced are not to be construed as a critical required or essential features or elements of any or all the claims. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during the pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.

Moreover in this document relational terms such as first and second top and bottom and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. The terms comprises comprising has having includes including contains containing or any other variation thereof are intended to cover a non exclusive inclusion such that a process method article or apparatus that comprises has includes contains a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process method article or apparatus. An element proceeded by comprises . . . a has . . . a includes . . . a contains . . . a does not without more constraints preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process method article or apparatus that comprises has includes contains the element. The terms a and an are defined as one or more unless explicitly stated otherwise herein. The terms substantially essentially approximately about or any other version thereof are defined as being close to as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and in one non limiting embodiment the term is defined to be within 10 in another embodiment within 5 in another embodiment within 1 and in another embodiment within 0.5 . The term coupled as used herein is defined as connected although not necessarily directly and not necessarily mechanically. A device or structure that is configured in a certain way is configured in at least that way but may also be configured in ways that are not listed.

It will be appreciated that some embodiments may be comprised of one or more generic or specialized processors or processing devices such as microprocessors digital signal processors customized processors and field programmable gate arrays FPGAs and unique stored program instructions including both software and firmware that control the one or more processors to implement in conjunction with certain non processor circuits some most or all of the functions of the method and apparatus for forming an actionable communication resource described herein. The non processor circuits may include but are not limited to a radio receiver a radio transmitter signal drivers clock circuits power source circuits and user input devices. As such these functions may be interpreted as steps of a method to perform forming an actionable communication resource described herein. Alternatively some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine that has no stored program instructions or in one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs in which each function or some combinations of certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic. Of course a combination of the two approaches could be used. Both the state machine and ASIC are considered herein as a processing device for purposes of the foregoing discussion and claim language.

Moreover an embodiment can be implemented as a computer readable storage element or medium having computer readable code stored thereon for programming a computer e.g. comprising a processing device to perform a method as described and claimed herein. Examples of such computer readable storage elements include but are not limited to a hard disk a CD ROM an optical storage device a magnetic storage device a ROM Read Only Memory a PROM Programmable Read Only Memory an EPROM Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory an EEPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory and a Flash memory. Further it is expected that one of ordinary skill notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by for example available time current technology and economic considerations when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation.

The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition in the foregoing Detailed Description it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather as the following claims reflect inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.
