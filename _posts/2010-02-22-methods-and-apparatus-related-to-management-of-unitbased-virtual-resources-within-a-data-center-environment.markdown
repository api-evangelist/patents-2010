Embodiments described herein relate generally to virtual resources within a data center and in particular to management of unit based virtual resources within a data center environment.

Because data center environments e.g. cloud computing data center environments are defined by a relatively large scale infrastructure management of the various components within the infrastructure can be complicated and may not be handled in a desirable fashion using known methods and apparatus. In particular known methods and apparatus for managing resources of infrastructure to provide a specified level service e.g. a guaranteed level of service to users with virtual resources operating within the data center environment may not be adequate for some applications. Many of these known methods and apparatus for example may be too specialized for some applications and or may not integrate the diverse functionality of various systems that control and or manage components within the data center environment to provide a specified level of service in a desirable fashion.

Thus a need exists for methods and apparatus for management of unit based virtual resources within a data center environment.

In one embodiment a processor readable medium can be configured to store code representing instructions to be executed by a processor. The code can include code to receive a request to change a value representing a number of data center units included in a set of data center units assigned to a user. Each of the data center units from the set of data center units can be associated with hardware resources managed based on a set of predefined hardware resource limit values. The code can include code to determine in response to the request whether hardware resources of a data center unit mutually exclusive from hardware resources of the set of data center units and managed based on the set of predefined resource limit values is available for assignment to the user when the request to change is an increase request.

As represented by the dashed lines from the data center units to a user the hardware resources of the data center units are managed e.g. allocated provisioned reserved for use by the user e.g. for processing associated with the user . Said differently the data center units or the data center units of the data center units are assigned to the user . Because the data center units are assigned to the user the user can use the hardware resources of data center units to for example perform one or more functions specified by the user . For example the hardware resources of data center units can be used by the user for example to operate one or more virtual resources e.g. virtual machines not shown of the user . In some embodiments the user can be a customer a client a company and or so forth. In some embodiments the user can represent a computing element e.g. a server a personal computer a personal digital assistant PDA associated with for example a human user.

The data center units can each be managed as a specified portion of resources e.g. hardware resources software resources of the data center . In other words resources of the data center can be divided into e.g. partitioned into data center units that can be used for example to handle processing associated with one or more virtual resources for users such as user . In some embodiments the virtual resource s can be configured to for example emulate the functionality of a physical source device and or its associated software.

For example in some embodiments the hardware resources and the associated software resources to support the hardware resources of one or more of the data center units can be managed so that they perform at or are capable of performing at for example predefined hardware resource limit values. Specifically the hardware resources of one or more of the data center units can managed so that they perform at for example a specified level of network bandwidth e.g. 10 megabits second Mb s of network bandwidth a specified level of network bandwidth of more than 1 Mb s of network bandwidth a specified level of processing speed e.g. a processor speed of 300 megahertz MHz a processor speed of 600 MHz a specific processor speed of more than 200 MHz a specified input output I O speed of a storage device e.g. a disk I O speed of 40 I O operations per second a specified disk I O speed of more than 10 IOPS and or a specified storage device bandwidth e.g. a disk bandwidth of 10 Mb s a specified level of disk bandwidth of more than 10 Mb s . A specified portion of hardware resources can also be reserved as part of one or more of the data center unit s . For example the data center unit s can also have a specified level of a storage device e.g. a disk size of 30 gigabytes GB a specified disk size of more than 1 GB and or a specified memory space e.g. a memory storage capacity of 768 megabytes MB a specified memory storage capacity of more than 64 MB allocated to the data center unit s .

In some embodiments the hardware resources and accompanying software of the data center can be partitioned so that the data center units are guaranteed if necessary to perform at or have hardware resources at the predefined hardware resource limit values. In other words the hardware resources of the data center units can be managed so that they provide guaranteed levels of service that correspond with each or every predefined hardware resource limit value from a set of predefined hardware resource limit values. Said another way the hardware resources or portions thereof of a data center unit from the data center units can be reserved so that they are available for processing associated with the user . For example a first hardware resource or a portion thereof e.g. a memory component that defines a first portion of data center unit DU can provide a guaranteed level of service that corresponds within a first predefined hardware resource limit value from a set of predefined hardware resource limit values and a second hardware resource or a portion thereof e.g. a network card that defines a second portion of data center unit DU can provide a guaranteed level of service that corresponds within a second predefined hardware resource limit value from the set of predefined hardware resource limit values.

In some embodiments if one or more of the hardware resources of the data center units are not performing functions for the user e.g. performing processing of virtual resources associated with the user the hardware resource s or portions thereof that are associated with the data center units may be idle or substantially idle . The hardware resource s of the data center units will be idle or substantially idle so that they are guaranteed to be available for processing for the user when they are needed. In some embodiments a guaranteed level of service can also be referred to as a guaranteed level of functionality.

In some embodiments the set of predefined hardware resource limit values which can be used to define the data center units can be defined based on statistical data based on a predefined set of virtual resources that indicates a particular combination of hardware resources can be used to operate a virtual resource. In some embodiments for example a set of predefined hardware resource limit values can be defined based empirical data. Specifically a hardware resource limit value associated with a particular hardware type e.g. a disk type can first be selected. Additional hardware resource limit values associated with other hardware types can be defined based on empirical data related to desirable operation of the additional hardware resources when the particular hardware type is operating at the selected hardware resource limit value. Accordingly the set of predefined hardware resource limits values can be defined based on the collective performance of the hardware resources using the selected hardware resource limit value as a starting point. In some embodiments the data center units can be defined by a set of predefined hardware resource limit values so that the data center unit can operate a particular type of virtual resource or set of virtual resources in a desirable fashion within a particular set of performance specifications .

The hardware resources of the data center units can be managed e.g. allocated reserved at least in part by the resource controller or a portion thereof based on one or more predefined hardware resource limit values. For example the resource controller can be configured to manage a resource e.g. a software resource a hardware resource of the data center or a portion thereof to one or more of the data center units based on a predefined hardware resource limit value e.g. a predefined hardware resource limit value from a set of predefined hardware resource limit values . In other words the predefined hardware resource limit values can be policed or enforced by the resource controller . For example the resource controller can be configured to manage processing resources of a processor of a host device not shown within the data center so that a specified portion of the processing capacity of the processor which can correspond with a hardware resource limit value is reserved for the data center unit DU. The resource controller or a portion thereof can be configured to interface with the resources of the data center so that the hardware resources from the resources of the data center of data center units can provide guaranteed levels of service that correspond with a set of predefined hardware resource limit values. In some embodiments the resource controller can include one or more specialized resource controllers that are each configured to manage resources associated with a particular type of resource e.g. a memory type a central processing unit . More details related to a resource controller and specialized resource controllers are described in connection with .

In some embodiments the hardware resources of one or more of the data center units can be managed so that only certain predefined hardware resource limit values of the hardware resources of the data center unit s are guaranteed. In some embodiments for example the hardware resources of data center unit DU can be managed by the resource controller or a portion thereof so that the hardware resources of data center unit DU can provide a guaranteed level of processing speed and have a guaranteed portion of disk space available but can be managed so that the hardware resources of data center unit DU may provide a specified bandwidth speed in only certain situations. Accordingly the bandwidth speed of the hardware resources of data center unit DU is not guaranteed. In such circumstances the data center unit DU can be referred to as a partially guaranteed data center unit.

In some embodiments the hardware resources of data center units can be managed so that the hardware resources of each of the data center units is managed based on the same set of hardware resource limit values. Accordingly hardware resources of each data center unit from the data center units may be managed so that they provide the same or substantially the same guaranteed level of service.

In some embodiments the hardware resources of one or more of the data center units can be based on different sets of predefined hardware resource limit values. For example the hardware resources of data center unit DU can be based on a first set of predefined hardware resource limit values and the hardware resources of data center unit DU can be based on a second set of predefined hardware resource limit values different than the first set of predefined hardware resource limit values. In such instances the hardware resources of data center unit DU can provide a different guaranteed level of service than the guaranteed level of service provided by hardware resources of data center unit DU. The resource controller can be configured to managed the hardware resources of these different data center units based on the different sets of predefined hardware resource limit values.

In some embodiments one or more of the data center units can include software resources. In other words software resources can be associated with and can define at least a portion of the data center unit s . For example the hardware resources of data center unit DU can have a software resource licensed specifically for operation of and or operation within the hardware resources of data center unit DU. In some embodiments the resource controller or a portion thereof can be configured to manage the software resources of the data center so that the software resources are allocated e.g. assigned as specified to the hardware resources of each of the data center units .

Resource controllers configured to manage a portion of a data center unit that is hardware based can be referred to as hardware resource controllers. For example a data center unit that includes specified allotment of memory can be defined by a hardware controller. Similarly resource controllers configured to manage a portion of a data center unit that is software based can be referred to as software resource controllers. Software resources and hardware resources of a data center unit can be collectively referred to as processing resources. Accordingly the processing resources of a data center unit can be managed by e.g. collectively managed by a resource controller.

As shown in the management module can be in communication with e.g. can be accessed via a user interface UI . The user interface can be configured so that a user e.g. a data center administrator a network administrator a customer a source owner can send signals e.g. control signals input signals signals related to instructions to the management module and or receive signals e.g. output signals from the management module . Specifically the user interface can be configured so that the user can trigger one or more functions to be performed e.g. executed at the management module via the user interface and or receive an output signal from the onboard engine at for example a display not shown of the user interface . For example in some embodiments a user can manage at least a portion of the database via the user interface . In some embodiments the user interface can be a graphical user interface GUI .

As shown in an integer number of data center units which can each have hardware resources managed based on the same set of predefined hardware resource limit values are assigned to e.g. reserved for use by the user . A request for a specified number or a change in a number of the data center units such as the data center units shown in can be received at the management module . In some embodiments the request can be defined in response to an input from the user . In other words the user can make a request for a specified number of data center units via the user interface .

A value representing the number of data center units can be stored in a database within a memory of the management module . Each number can represent the hardware resources collectively managed as a data center unit. In some embodiments the value can be associated with an identifier representing the user . An example of a database storing information related to data center units assigned to a user is shown in .

As shown in virtual resources AVRthrough AVR shown in the column labeled virtual resources are associated with user A and virtual resources BVRthrough BVR shown in the column labeled virtual resources are associated with user B. Although not shown in the database can also be defined to represent which of the data center resources of the data center units are operating each of the virtual resources. For example although not shown the database can be configured to store information representing that data center resources defining data center unit DCare operating virtual resources AVRthrough AVR. In some embodiments the virtual resources can be configured to emulate one or more functions of for example a legacy source device being migrated to the virtual resources . More details related to migration of a source to a data center to be emulated as one or more virtual resource are described in connection with co pending patent application Ser. No. 12 709 954 filed on Feb. 22 2010 entitled Methods and Apparatus Related to Migration of Customer Resources to Virtual Resources within a Data Center Environment and co pending patent application Ser. No. 12 709 943 filed on Feb. 22 2010 entitled Methods and Apparatus for Movement of Virtual Resources within a Data Center Environment which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

In some embodiments the database can be dynamically updated to represent changes in resources e.g. software resources hardware resources such as a decrease or increase in a number of data center resources assigned to the one or more of the users. Specifically values representing the number of data center units and assigned to a user represented by the user identifiers can be dynamically modified.

Referring back to in some embodiments the user can request via the user interface an increase in a number of data center units such as data center units assigned to the user . Accordingly a request to change a value representing the number of data center units assigned to the user can be received at the management module . The value can be stored at the memory of the management module . A request to increase a number of data center units can be referred to as an increase request. The request can be received at the management module from the user interface .

In response to an increase request the management module can be configured to determine whether or not resources of the data center are available to be assigned to the user as resources of a data center unit. In some embodiments the management module can be configured to store inventory information representing resources available at the data center in the memory for example in database . In such embodiments the management module can be configured to access the inventory information and determine based on the inventory information whether one or more data center units or hardware resources of one or more data center units not shown are available to be assigned to a user such as user . In some embodiments inventory information representing an unassigned pool of resources and or data center units or hardware of data center units can be stored in the memory . An example of inventory information that can be stored in the database of the memory is shown in .

Although not shown in some embodiments a database can be configured to store inventory information related to individual hardware resources e.g. processor network interface cards storage devices that can be managed as a data center unit. Specifically the availability or unavailability of the individual hardware resources or portions thereof can be stored in the database. Based on this inventory information about the hardware resources or portions of the hardware resources a management module such as management module shown in can determine whether or not hardware resources may be available to define a data center unit that can be assigned to a user.

Referring back to if a data center unit not shown is available for assignment to user or if hardware resources of the data center are available to be managed as a data center unit that can be assigned to user the management module can be configured to assign the available data center unit to user so that the hardware resources of the data center unit can be used by for example a virtual resource associated with the user . In other words if a sufficient number of data center units are available to satisfy the increase request the management module can grant the request and assign the data center unit s to the user . The data center units that are assigned to the user can be removed from for example a pool of unassigned resources or data center units . In some embodiments one or more data center units that are assigned to a user in response to an increase request can have a status associated with the data center unit s changed from an available status to an unavailable status. In some embodiments the availability or unavailability of a data center unit or hardware resources that can be used to define a data center unit can be determined based on inventory information stored in the memory .

In some embodiments the user can request via the user interface a decrease in a number of data center units such as data center units assigned to the user . Accordingly a request to change a value representing the number of data center units which can represented hardware resources collectively managed as a data center unit assigned to the user can be received at the management module . A request to decrease a number of data center units can be referred to as an decrease request. The request can be received at the management module from the user interface .

In some embodiments hardware resources of a data center unit removed from a set of data center units previously assigned to a user can be reassigned to another user. For example if hardware resources managed as a data center unit DU are removed from the set of data center units in response to a decrease request from the user the hardware resources managed as data center unit DU can be assigned to another user not shown . The reassignment can be represented in a database stored in the memory . In some embodiments the data center unit DU e.g. the hardware resources of the data center unit DU can be returned to a pool of unassigned data center units.

In some embodiments the memory can be for example a random access memory RAM e.g. a dynamic RAM a static RAM a flash memory a removable memory and or so forth. In some embodiments the database can be implemented as for example a relational database an indexed database a table and or so forth. Although the memory and the database are shown as being local to the management module in some embodiments one or more portions of the database can be stored in a remote memory that can be accessed by the management module . For example the portions of the database can be stored in a separate e.g. a remote storage device e.g. storage facility that can be accessed by the management module via a network e.g. a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN not shown .

As shown in the management module can include a monitoring module . The monitoring module can be configured to trigger a change in a number of data center units such as data center units assigned to a user such as user based on one or more values representing performance associated with the hardware resources of data center units. The values representing performance can be referred to as performance metric values. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to trigger an increase or a decrease in a number of data center units assigned to user in response to a threshold condition being satisfied based on one or more performance metric values.

For example the monitoring module can be configured to remove data center unit DU from the set of data center units assigned to user in response to a performance metric value indicating that the data center units collectively are being under utilized. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to add an additional data center unit not shown or hardware resources of the additional data center unit to the set of data center units assigned to user in response to a performance metric value indicating that the hardware resources of data center units collectively are being over utilized. The over utilization can be manifested in for example failure data. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to replace one or more data center units such as data center units assigned to a user such as user based on a threshold condition being satisfied based on a performance metric value. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to modify a number of data center assigned to a user by modifying a value stored in a database such as database that represents a number of data center units.

Referring back to the monitoring module can be configured to modify a number of data center units assigned to a user such as user based on various performance metric values such as for example a capacity value a value representing a failure rate a utilization value and or so forth. In some embodiments the performance metric values can be associated with a specified period of time.

In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to receive the values e.g. pushed values pulled values representing the performance metric from the data center or a portion thereof . For example in some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to receive one or more performance metric values produced by virtual resources operating within the hardware resources of data center units of the data center . In some embodiments the performance metric values can be received periodically randomly in a preselected manner and or in response to a request from the monitoring module . In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to request and receive data from one or more resources e.g. hardware resources software resources virtual resources of the data center that can be used to calculate a performance metric value.

In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to send a notification to for example the user via user interface indicating that a number of data center units assigned to the user should be modified. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to modify a number of data center units by modifying a value representing the number of data center units assigned to the user only when authorized to do so by the user. In some embodiments the monitoring module can be configured to solicit authorization from the user via the user interface for modification of the number of the data center units . When authorization is received from the user via the user interface the monitoring module can be configured to modify the number of data center units assigned to the user .

In some embodiments the management module can be configured to identify a minimum number of data center units such as data center units to operate a virtual resource. For example the management module can be configured to identify or calculate a minimum number of data center units based on one or more assessment parameter values to operate a virtual resource within a data center environment. In some embodiments the management module can be configured to determine that a particular minimum number of data center units are used to operate a virtual resource emulating for example at least a portion of a particular physical device. In some embodiments the number of discrete data center units selected to operate a virtual resource or set of virtual resources can be determined by the management module based on for example an ability of the data center units to handle bursa processing levels of the virtual resource s and or an average processing level of the virtual resource s . In some embodiments the calculations related to numbers of data center units to operate a virtual resource can be performed by an assessment module portion not shown of the management module .

In some embodiments the processor controller can be configured to manage the resources of one or more processors not shown of the data center so that a certain portion of the computing cycles of the processor s are reserved for the data center unit . In other words the computing cycles can be reserved so that if the computing cycles are needed by a virtual resource of a user to whom the data center unit is assigned the computing cycles will be available for use by the virtual resource of the user. For example in some embodiments computing cycles substantially equivalent to for example a 100 MHz processor a 1.5 GHz processor or so forth can be reserved for the data center unit . In some embodiments a hardware resource limit value specific to the processor controller can be referred to as a processor limit value.

In some embodiments one or more functions of the resources controller can be included as a function of the management module . Although not shown in some embodiments the resource controllers can include a software resource controller.

A set of data center units assigned to operate the set of virtual resources is modified in response to the performance metric satisfying a threshold condition at . In some embodiments a number of data center units mapped to the set of virtual resources can be increased or decreased. In some embodiments the threshold condition can be optionally defined within the user preference associated with a user or can be based on a default value.

If the request is an increase request at the availability of an additional data center unit is determined at . The availability can be determined based on information about a pool of unassigned data center units stored in a database. As shown in the additional data center unit is assigned to the user at when the data center unit is available at .

When the additional data center units are not available at the request is denied at . In some embodiments the additional data center units may not be available because they are assigned to another user or because resources e.g. hardware resources software resources managed as a data center unit are not available. In some embodiments the request may not be denied but can instead be assigned a pending state e.g. a held state until resources e.g. hardware resources software resources that can be assigned to the user become available. In other words the request can be pending until resources that can be managed as a data center unit and can be assigned to the user become available. In some embodiments the request can be queued with other requests in a request queue. In some embodiments a queue of requests can be handled in a first in first out FIFO fashion or in some other order.

If the request is an decrease request at at least one data center unit is included in a pool of unassigned data center units at . An assignment of the data center unit s can be modified so that they are no longer assigned to the user and instead included in a pool of unassigned data center units. In other words a representation of the data center unit s are included in a pool of unassigned data center units so that for example a management module can identify these data center unit s as not being assigned to a user. Although not shown in some embodiments a management module for example can be configured to reassign one or more of the data center units to another user rather than include the data center unit s in the pool of unassigned data center units.
