The present application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 981 360 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FACILITATING WIRELESS COMMUNICATION VIA ALTERNATE WIRELESS PATHWAY and filed on even date herewith.

The present invention relates to mobile devices and other devices with which the mobile device can communicate and related methods of operation and more particularly to such devices and related methods of operation in which there is a possibility of communication of information to and or from mobile devices by way of more than one communication pathway.

As mobile devices such as cellular telephones and smart phones become more powerful in their capabilities operation of the mobile devices increasingly involves the receipt and or transmission of ever larger quantities of information. Such information can include content communicated from or to content provider websites CPWs which can be understood to encompass a variety of interactive websites that allow for the downloading and or uploading e.g. posting of various forms of information including for example social networking websites SNWs news feeds music and photograph websites as well as other types of websites such as business to business b2b or business to consumer b2c websites. Also the information received and or transmitted by a mobile device can also include for example software updates allowing for modifications and or supplements to be provided in relation to a variety of software program s that are implemented on the mobile device.

Many mobile devices operate to receive and or transmit information by way of cellular networks such as 2G and more commonly today 3G cellular networks among others. The information communicated in this manner can include both information being communicated to or from CPWs as well as software updates as mentioned above. While such information can be successfully communicated to and from mobile devices by way of such cellular networks this conventional manner of communicating information is not always ideal. Among other things wireless carriers are often concerned about the volume of information being communicated via the cellular networks since attempts to communicate large or excessive amounts of information can overly tax or overload the cellular networks such that the information can only ultimately be communicated at an undesirably slow pace or in a manner that may be disruptive to other communications being handled by the cellular networks. In some cases communication of information may need to be stopped and started or restarted before it ultimately is completed.

With respect to software updates in particular to the extent that a given mobile device is already performing other activities involving cellular communications when the wireless carrier or other source of a software update attempts to commence the software update the performing of the software update may need to be deferred and reattempted at a later time when the mobile device is not busy. This is disadvantageous not only for the specific mobile device that is busy since installation of the software update on that mobile device is delayed but also for the wireless carrier or other source of the software update attempting to install the software update. Indeed it is often desired that a given software update be commonly applied to multiple e.g. many thousands of mobile devices as part of a network wide rollout of the update. Assuming that not just one but many mobile devices may be unreceptive to a given software update at the time s when it is first provided in practice it can often take a long period of time e.g. several days for a wireless carrier or other source of the update to successfully apply the update in relation to all of the mobile devices for which that update is intended.

Additionally it may also be undesirable to mobile device users for their mobile devices to receive or transmit such information via cellular network connections. For example it may be undesirable to a mobile device user for his or her mobile device to receive a software update via a cellular network connection if the mobile device user is also desiring that connection to be used for other purposes e.g. for communication with a CPW . This is especially the case given that the downloading of some software updates via cellular network connections can take a relatively long period of time e.g. ten minutes during which period other cellular network communications may not be possible. Further in some cases wireless carriers charge mobile device users extra fees when the amounts of information communicated between the users mobile devices and the cellular networks exceed specified amounts. Given such fees users may find it undesirable for their mobile devices to send or receive particular types or information via cellular networks.

It would therefore be advantageous if improved mobile devices and or other devices with which the mobile device can communicate and or related methods of operation could be developed that would help to address at least partly one or more concerns such as those discussed above.

In at least one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of operating a mobile device that is capable of communicating wirelessly via a Wide Area Network WAN communication link. The method includes a detecting an availability of an additional communication link made possible via an access point AP and b determining whether one or more first criteria relating to one or both of the AP and the mobile device have been met. The method also includes c provided that the one or more first criteria are met automatically launching at the mobile device a browser program to communicate with one or both of the AP and a remote server via the additional communication link. The method further include d determining based upon one or more interactions between the browser program and one or both of the AP and the remote server whether one or more second criteria for allowing communications to proceed via the additional communication link have been met and e provided that the one or more second criteria are met conducting the communications wirelessly via the additional communication link.

In at least one further embodiment the present invention relates to a mobile device capable of conducting both Wide Area Network WAN communications and Wi Fi communications. The mobile device includes at least one memory portion a first communication device having one or both of a first transmitter and a first receiver capable of conducting the WAN communications and a second communication device having one or both of a second transmitter and a second receiver capable of conducting the Wi Fi communications. The mobile device additionally includes at least one processor portion at least indirectly in communication with each of the at least one memory portion the first communication device and the second communication device where the at least one processor portion determines that one or more first criteria are met regarding one or both of the mobile device and an access point AP with which it is possible for the Wi Fi communications to be established. Additionally upon determining that the one or more first criteria are met the at least one processor portion launches a browser program stored on the at least one memory portion by which the mobile device is capable of interacting with a remote server. Further upon one or more second criteria being met as a result of operation of the browser program the Wi Fi communications are conducted by the mobile device via the second communication device and the WAN communications are ended.

Additionally in at least one additional embodiment the present invention relates to a method of operating a mobile device that is capable of communicating wirelessly via a Wide Area Network WAN communication link. The method includes a detecting an availability of an additional communication link made possible via a first access point AP and b launching at the mobile device a client application to communicate with one or both of the first AP and a remote server via the additional communication link. The method also includes c determining that communications via the additional communication link can proceed on a free basis and d upon determining that the communications can proceed on the free basis further determining based upon one or more interactions between the client application and one or both of the first AP and the remote server whether one or more additional criteria for allowing the communications to proceed via the additional communication link have been met. The method further includes e conducting the communications wirelessly via the additional communication link provided that the one or more additional criteria are met.

Referring to a block diagram of an example communications system is shown in a simplified schematic form. As shown the communications system includes in this embodiment a mobile device that is indirectly in communication with a server which in the present embodiment is a web server e.g. a server that supports internet protocols or otherwise is capable of interaction with the internet or World Wide Web . The mobile device in the present embodiment is capable of communicating with the web server by way of at least two different wireless communication networks either simultaneously or at least at different times. A first of the wireless communication networks is a cellular network including first and second cell towers and respectively as well as first second and third communication links and respectively. The first of the wireless communication networks can also be considered a Wide Area Network WAN . As for the second of the wireless communication networks this is a Wi Fi network including first and second access points and respectively as well as first second and third communication links and respectively. The access points can also in at least some circumstances be hot spots serving as publicly accessible wireless internet connection transceivers such as are found with increasing frequency in public or semi public venues such as malls restaurants stores hotels etc.

As shown the first and second communication links and respectively represent connections wireless or otherwise between the web server and the first and second cell towers and respectively while the third communication link is a wireless connection between the mobile device and the first cell tower . The third communication link particularly is formed between the mobile device and the first cell tower because the mobile device is within a coverage region or zone of the first cell tower even though it is not within a coverage region not specifically shown in of the second cell tower . If the mobile device is moved it may no longer be within coverage region and consequently the third communication link may be broken.

As for the first and second communication links and these respective links represent connections wireless or otherwise between the web server and the first and second access points and respectively while the third communication link is a wireless connection between the mobile device and the first access point . The third communication link particularly is formed between the mobile device and the first access point because the mobile device is within a coverage region or zone of the first access point even though it is not within a coverage region not specifically shown in of the second access point . If the mobile device is moved it may no longer be within coverage region and consequently the third communication link may be broken.

Typically the cellular network is designed so that the mobile device when leaving one coverage region such as the coverage region will be correspondingly entering or will have already entered another coverage region e.g. such as a coverage region of the second cell tower such that the mobile device can remain in contact with the cellular network in a seamless or nearly seamless manner within a large geographic area. By contrast with the coverage zones of the cellular network which are often overlapping or contiguous so as to allow for largely seamless communication coverage for the mobile device within a large geographic region commonly the coverage zones associated with the access points of the Wi Fi network are not overlapping or contiguous at least not to a high degree. Consequently it can be understood that when the mobile device leaves the coverage region of the first access point it will no longer be in communication with the Wi Fi network at least for a period of time until it enters another coverage zone of an access point of that network.

The mobile device is representative of wireless communication devices operated by persons or users or possibly by other entities e.g. other computers desiring or requiring wireless communication capabilities. In some embodiments for example the mobile device can be a device selected from among a variety of types of cellular telephones personal digital assistants PDAs smart phones other handheld or portable electronic devices headsets MP3 players battery powered devices wearable devices radios navigation devices laptop or notebook computers netbooks pagers PMPs personal media players DVRs digital video recorders gaming devices cameras netbooks e readers e books tablet devices navigation devices with video capable screens multimedia docking stations or other mobile devices.

As for the web server this device can take a variety of forms depending upon the embodiment. Although only the single web server is shown in it should be understood that this is only for simplicity of illustration and in practice the mobile device can often be in communication simultaneously or substantially simultaneously or at different times with multiple web servers rather than just a single web server by way of wireless communication networks such as the cellular network and the Wi Fi network . Also it should further be understood that while in the present embodiment the mobile device is shown to be in communication with the web server or multiple web servers depending upon the embodiment the mobile device can also or instead be in communication with one or more other types of servers e.g. servers that are not web based that is do not engage in communications via the World Wide Web or other devices that are not servers. That is should be understood to represent on a most general level wireless communications between a mobile device and any arbitrary number of any arbitrary type s of devices.

In some embodiments and as will be assumed for purposes of discussion with respect to the web server can more particularly be a content provider website CPW which can be understood generally to encompass any of a variety of interactive websites including for example social networking websites SNWs business to business websites business to consumer websites news feeds music and or photograph websites and or other websites that allow for the downloading uploading e.g. posting and or other accessing of various forms of information or data which can be considered content . Examples of such CPWs include for example Facebook MySpace hi5 LinkedIn and Twitter as well as sources of RSS Really Simple Syndication or other news feeds photograph services such as Picasa or Photobucket and music services such as LastFM . Examples of the content can include personal and or business information news information weather information pictures videos and songs. Generally speaking the CPWs can encompass any websites to or from which the content can be uploaded and or downloaded as indicated by double headed arrows from or to mobile devices such as the mobile device .

In other embodiments and as will be assumed for purposes of discussion with respect to the web server is configured to serve as an intermediary between the mobile devices and other devices not shown where the other devices can for example be one or more CPWs. In some such embodiments the web server can be but need not be operated by and or otherwise affiliated with a manufacturer of the mobile device . Operating in this manner the web server allows for various types of communications to occur between the mobile device and other devices e.g. CPWs where the communicated information is passed through processed and or monitored by the web server . Such communications can involve for example the uploading and downloading of files e.g. photos music videos text entries etc. blog postings and messaging e.g. Short Message Service SMS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and Instant Messaging IM . When operating as an intermediary in this manner the web server can communicate with the CPW s or other devices by way of a variety of communication links or mechanisms including in at least some embodiments additional communication links that are part of the cellular network or Wi Fi network .

As will be discussed further particularly in relation to the the web server can in some circumstances serve as a source of one or more software updates such as a software update shown in that are intended for receipt at and installation upon the mobile device . This can be the case when the web server is one of the CPWs or when the web server is an intermediary e.g. an intermediary operated by or affiliated with a manufacturer of the mobile device as mentioned above or when the web server takes another form. For example in some circumstances the web server can be a server operated by and or otherwise affiliated with the wireless carrier mobile communication network operator operating the cellular network and or the Wi Fi network . With respect to such software updates upgrades it should be understood that the software that can be updated in any given instance can encompass a wide variety of types of software including applications programs firmware patches. The software updates upgrades can depending upon the embodiment involve one or both of modifications to existing software already residing on the mobile device as well as the installation of entirely new software applications or programs on the mobile device .

In at least some embodiments it should be also understood that the access points themselves can have web servers or other server functionality residing thereon or associated therewith. shows for example such an AP web server to be residing on the first access point . Such web server s can in some embodiments be provided to govern or influence how or under what circumstances the access points can interact with various mobile devices such as the mobile device . In some such embodiments as discussed further below a web server residing on or associated with an access point e.g. the AP web server can be considered a re direct server or captive portal that is first accessed when a mobile device such as the mobile device first attempts to access the access point.

Further in this regard when a browser equipped mobile device such as the mobile device attempts to first establish communications with an access point such as the first access point the mobile device initially is directed to the re direct server or a home page or web page thereof for interaction therewith before other communications with other web servers can occur via the access point even if accessing of another web server such as the web server or home page or web page thereof has already been requested. That is the mobile device is only allowed by the first access point to access one specific Universal Resource Locator URL that is associated with the re direct server captive portal as specified by that access point. That said although a web server that is locally based at the access point such as the AP web server can sometimes serve as the re direct server or captive portal the re direct server captive portal need not always be locally based at the access point but rather can be located remotely from the access point.

With respect to the communication links shown in while the respective third communication links and are both representative of wireless signals transmitted through the air atmosphere between the mobile device and the cell tower and access point respectively the other ones of the communication links are intended to be more generally representative of any of a variety of types of communication paths by which the cell tower and access point can communicate with the web server . Thus depending upon the embodiment the communication links can each include one or more wired and or wireless communication pathways for example landline e.g. fiber optic copper wiring microwave communication radio channel wireless path intranet internet and or World Wide Web communication pathways which themselves can employ numerous intermediary hardware and or software devices including for example numerous routers etc. .

In addition a variety of communication protocols and methodologies can be used to conduct web based communications via the communication links between the mobile device and web server including for example transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP file transfer protocol FTP etc. In other embodiments other types of protocols or communications techniques can be utilized to achieve web based and or internet type communications. To enable or facilitate such web based communications in the present embodiment the mobile device has stored thereon at least one browser program application that allows the mobile device to operate as a client relative to web based servers such as the web server and the AP web server mentioned above. As discussed further below the browser program can be helpful for example in establishing communications via the Wi Fi network . Although the present embodiment envisions the presence of browser program s such as the browser program allowing for the mobile device to operate as a client in other embodiments e.g. that of where the web server is a device management server as discussed further below other programs allowing for the mobile device to operate as a client can be employed instead of or in addition to such browser program s .

Notwithstanding the above discussion in some alternate embodiments for example some embodiments where the web server is replaced by other types of servers or other types of devices it should be understood that a variety of other types of communication links for facilitating the transfer of signals between the mobile device and such other devices can be utilized. Among other things although in the present embodiment involving the web server the networks and communication links conduct web based internet type communications in other embodiments the networks communication links can assume various non web based forms and need not involve the internet and correspondingly internet type protocols need not be employed in such embodiments.

Referring to there is provided a block diagram illustrating example internal components of the mobile device of in accordance with the present embodiment. It should be understood that while the internal components are present in the mobile device all of these internal components need not be present in every mobile device that might communicate with the web server or with other devices via the cellular network and or Wi Fi network . That said as shown in the components include multiple wireless transceivers a processor e.g. a microprocessor microcomputer application specific integrated circuit etc. a memory portion one or more output devices and one or more input devices . In at least some embodiments a user interface is present that comprises one or more of the output devices such as a display and one or more of the input device such as a keypad or touch sensor.

The internal components can further include a component interface to provide a direct connection to auxiliary components or accessories for additional or enhanced functionality. The internal components preferably also include a power supply such as a battery for providing power to the other internal components while enabling the mobile device to be portable. Further the internal components additionally include one or more sensors . All of the internal components can be coupled to one another and in communication with one another by way of one or more internal communication links e.g. an internal bus .

As will be evident from further discussion below at least some embodiments of the present invention are directed to facilitating communications by the mobile device that particularly involve switching between cellular type communications and other types of wireless communications so as to thereby achieve one or more advantages. This being the case in the present embodiment of the wireless transceivers particularly include a cellular transceiver and a Wi Fi transceiver . More particularly the cellular transceiver is configured to conduct 3G cellular communications vis vis cell towers such as the first cell tower and potentially the second cell tower albeit in other embodiments the cellular transceiver can be configured to utilize any of a variety of other cellular based communication technologies such as analog communications using AMPS digital communications using CDMA TDMA GSM iDEN GPRS EDGE etc. and or next generation communications using UMTS WCDMA LTE IEEE 802.16 etc. or variants thereof.

By contrast the Wi Fi transceiver is a wireless local area network WLAN transceiver configured to conduct Wi Fi communications in accordance with the IEEE 802.11 a b g or n standard with access points such as the first access point and potentially the second access point . In other embodiments Wi Fi transceiver can instead or in addition conduct other types of communications commonly understood as being encompassed within Wi Fi communications such as some types of peer to peer e.g. Wi Fi Peer to Peer communications. Further in other embodiments the Wi Fi transceiver can be replaced or supplemented with one or more other wireless transceivers configured for non cellular wireless communications including for example wireless transceivers employing ad hoc communication technologies such as HomeRF radio frequency Home Node B 3G femtocell Bluetooth and or other wireless communication technologies such as infrared technology. Thus although in the present embodiment the mobile device has two of the wireless transceivers and the present disclosure is intended to encompass numerous embodiments in which any arbitrary number of e.g. more than two wireless transceivers employing any arbitrary number of e.g. two or more communication technologies are present.

Example operation of the wireless transceivers in conjunction with others of the internal components of the first one of the mobile devices can take a variety of forms and can include for example operation in which upon reception of wireless signals the internal components detect communication signals and the transceiver demodulates the communication signals to recover incoming information such as voice and or data transmitted by the wireless signals e.g. the content and or software update of . After receiving the incoming information from the transceiver the processor formats the incoming information for the one or more output devices .

Likewise for transmission of wireless signals the processor formats outgoing information which can but need not be activated by the input devices and conveys the outgoing information to one or more of the wireless transceivers for modulation so as to provide modulated communication signals to be transmitted. The wireless transceiver s convey the modulated communication signals by way of wireless as well as possibly wired communication links such as the communication links to other devices such as the first cell tower and the first access point and potentially other cell towers and other access points such as the second cell tower and the second access point such that those signals or signals derived from those signals can proceed to other devices such as the web server .

Depending upon the embodiment the input and output devices of the internal components can include a variety of visual audio and or mechanical outputs. For example the output device s can include one or more visual output devices such as a liquid crystal display and light emitting diode indicator one or more audio output devices such as a speaker alarm and or buzzer and or one or more mechanical output devices such as a vibrating mechanism. The visual output devices among other things can also include a video screen. Likewise by example the input device s can include one or more visual input devices such as an optical sensor for example a camera lens and photosensor one or more audio input devices such as a microphone and one or more mechanical input devices such as a flip sensor keyboard keypad selection button navigation cluster touch pad capacitive sensor motion sensor and switch. Operations that can actuate one or more of the input devices can include not only the physical pressing actuation of buttons or other actuators but can also include for example opening the mobile device unlocking the device moving the device to actuate a motion moving the device to actuate a location positioning system and operating the device.

As mentioned above the internal components also can include one or more of various types of sensors . The sensors can include for example proximity sensors e.g. a light detecting sensor an ultrasound transceiver or an infrared transceiver touch sensors altitude sensors and one or more location circuits components that can include for example a Global Positioning System GPS receiver a triangulation receiver an accelerometer a tilt sensor a gyroscope or any other information collecting device that can identify a current location or user device interface carry mode of the mobile device . While the sensors are for the purposes of considered to be distinct from the input devices in other embodiments it is possible that one or more of the input devices can also be considered to constitute one or more of the sensors and vice versa . Additionally while in the present embodiment the input devices are shown to be distinct from the output devices it should be recognized that in some embodiments one or more devices serve both as input device s and output device s . For example in embodiments where a touchscreen is employed the touchscreen can be considered to constitute both a visual output device and a mechanical input device.

The memory portion of the internal components can encompass one or more memory devices of any of a variety of forms e.g. read only memory random access memory static random access memory dynamic random access memory etc. and can be used by the processor to store and retrieve data. In some embodiments the memory portion can be integrated with the processor in a single device e.g. a processing device including memory or processor in memory PIM albeit such a single device will still typically have distinct portions sections that perform the different processing and memory functions and that can be considered separate devices. The data that is stored by the memory portion can include but need not be limited to operating systems applications and informational data.

Each operating system includes executable code that controls basic functions of the mobile device such as interaction among the various components included among the internal components communication with external devices via the wireless transceivers and or the component interface and storage and retrieval of applications and data to and from the memory portion . Each application includes executable code that utilizes an operating system to provide more specific functionality such as file system service and handling of protected and unprotected data stored in the memory portion . Such operating system and or application information can include software update information such as the software update shown in as being downloaded to the mobile device software update information can be understood to potentially encompass update s to either application s or operating system s or both .

As for informational data this is non executable code or information that can be referenced and or manipulated by an operating system or application for performing functions of the mobile device. Additionally among other things informational data can include any of a variety of types of information that is uploaded from the mobile device to the web server downloaded to the mobile device from the web server or otherwise accessed by the mobile device at the web server . To the extent that the web server serves as an intermediary between the mobile device and other device s such as one or more CPWs informational data can also include information that is uploaded from the mobile device to such other device s downloaded to the mobile device from such other device s or otherwise accessed by the mobile device at such other device s with the web server operating therebetween. The informational data can include among other things the content mentioned with respect to .

Referring next to example components of the web server of are shown in more detail with it being assumed for this example that the web server is configured to act as an intermediary between the mobile device and another device e.g. a CPW as mentioned above both the mobile device and the other device are shown in dashed lines . In this embodiment as shown the web server includes a memory portion a processor portion in communication with that memory portion and first and second input output I O interfaces and respectively. In the present embodiment the first input output I O interface is intended to interface the processor portion with the communication links and and thus allow for communications between that processor portion of the web sever and the mobile device via those communication links and additionally the third communication links . In addition the second input output I O interface is intended to interface the processor portion with the other device via a communication link or links .

Further as shown in the processor portion also includes a front end portion and a back end portion . The front end portion communicates with the mobile device via the communication links and the first I O interface and the back end portion communicates with the other device via the communication link and the second I O interface . In some embodiments particularly where the other device is a CPW and more particularly a SNW the back end portion can be referred to as a Social Network Processor . In at least some embodiments the back end portion further supports pull communications with the other device e.g. when the other device is a CPW . The pull communications can for example be implemented using Representation State Transfer REST architecture of the type typical to the web. Assuming this to be the case the back end portion is configured to generate requests for information to be provided to the back end portion from the other device at times circumstances determined by the web server in response to which the other device searches for and provides back to the web server requested data.

Also in at least some embodiments the front end portion establishes a push channel in conjunction with the mobile device . In at least some such embodiments the push channel allows the front end portion to provide notifications and or device management commands generated by the front end portion from the web server to the mobile device at times circumstances determined by the web server . With respect to notifications these can be indicative of information content that is available to be provided to that mobile device . Upon receiving such notifications the mobile device in turn is able to respond to the notifications in manner s deemed appropriate by the mobile device. Such responses often but not necessarily always constitute requests that some or all of the available information content be provided from the front end portion of the web server to the mobile device . As for device management commands these can allow for the mobile device to be configured for communication with appropriate access points such as the first access point .

Although shows the web server to be in communication with only the mobile device and the other device it should be understood that the web server is capable of communicating not only with those two devices but rather with multiple mobile devices by way of the first I O interface and or multiple other devices by way of the second I O interface . Further notwithstanding the description provided with respect to the web server can take numerous other forms depending upon the implementation or embodiment. For example even though the web server in has both of the first and second I O interfaces in other embodiments only one interface or more than two interfaces are present. Also for example in at least some circumstances the web server can be considered a cloud and further can encompass a collection of multiple servers that are in communication with one another and that in at least some embodiments support internet technologies for communication between entities. Also in at least some embodiments the web server or corresponding cloud or other intermediating device s can employ web 2.0 functionality and beyond including for example further evolution of such functionality and or new push functionality.

Turning now to two schematic diagrams are provided illustrating example operation of at least some of the components of the system of . More particularly shows a flowchart illustrating example steps of an operational process in which the mobile device transitions between communications via the cellular network and communications via the Wi Fi network to allow for the communication of information such as the content and or the software update via the Wi Fi network rather than the cellular network. By comparison shows a schematic diagram illustrating example steps of another operational process in which the mobile device transitions between communications via the cellular network and communications via the Wi Fi network to allow for communication of a software update such as the software update of .

In accordance with the processes shown in it is possible for operation of the system to transition to communications via a WLAN such as the Wi Fi network assuming such network is available and meets one or more criteria as discussed further below from communications via a WAN such as the cellular network . Thanks to such transitioned communications the availability of local area network communications can be leveraged to reduce costs and or ameliorate other disadvantages associated with using the cellular network or other WANs to communicate information and particularly to reduce costs and or ameliorate other disadvantages associated with using the cellular network or other WANs to communicate large amounts of information such as that corresponding to the content and or software update .

Referring more particularly to the flowchart begins with a start step and then next at a step a mobile data user with a mobile device having multi mode e.g. both cellular WAN and Wi Fi WLAN communications capabilities such as the mobile device enters an area of coverage of one or more access points associated with respective Service Set Identifier s SSID s . For example with respect to the mobile device enters the coverage region of the first access point which will have an associated SSID. Assuming that when this occurs the mobile device already is within a coverage region of a cell tower such as the coverage region of the first cell tower of which is typically the case the mobile device with its multi mode communications capabilities thus is potentially able to communicate both with the cellular network and also with the Wi Fi network .

Next at a step it is determined at the mobile device e.g. by the processor whether one or more preliminary criteria are met. The preliminary criteria are criteria that if met would signify that it is appropriate for the mobile device to engage in establishing Wi Fi communications via the Wi Fi network and if such communications were established appropriate to drop communications involving the cellular network . The preliminary criteria considered at the step can vary depending upon the embodiment. In the present embodiment for example the mobile device among other things considers whether the mobile device has been stationary or substantially stationary for a particular amount x of time. Also for example the mobile device can consider whether the signal strength vis vis the first access point e.g. the signal strength of the third communication link is greater than a predefined minimum threshold. Relatedly the mobile device can also consider whether one or more quality of service QoS criteria are met.

The first of the aforementioned preliminary criteria is of interest because if the mobile device is not stationary or not substantially stationary it is likely that the mobile device will not remain within the coverage region for a long enough time that a particular desired communication of information e.g. communication of the content to or from the mobile device or communication of the software update to the mobile device can be accomplished. Whether the mobile device is stationary or substantially stationary can be determined in any of a variety of manners for example by using one or more of the location circuits components of the mobile device as discussed above. As for the others of the aforementioned preliminary criteria these can be of interest because if one or more of signal strength or QoS characteristics are not satisfactory then desired communications between the mobile device and the first access point can be rendered unreliable impractical or futile. How exactly signal strength and or QoS characteristics are measured and or what levels or standards are acceptable can vary depending upon the embodiment. For example signal strength can be measured based upon the strength e.g. magnitude level of the Wi Fi signal received by the Wi Fi transceiver of the mobile device .

Although in the present embodiment one or more of the aforementioned preliminary criteria are taken into account at the step in other embodiments a variety of other preliminary criteria also or instead can be taken into account. For example in some other embodiments the mobile device at the step considers whether it is within the coverage region or range of an access point such as the coverage region of the first access point or considers whether it has been within such a coverage region of an access point for more than a minimum amount of time which can be also an indication as to whether the mobile device will likely remain within range of the access point for a sufficient amount of time that desired communications can be achieved. Whether the mobile device is within the coverage region can itself be determined for example based upon ongoing signal strength measurements or indications of whether there is adequate power available at one or both of the mobile device and or the access point to allow for desired communications .

Yet another preliminary criterion that can be considered is whether the mobile device is or is not in use e.g. use involving communications via the cellular network or other use that taxes processing or memory resources of the mobile device in a substantial manner . Depending upon whether usage of a particular type or any usage at all is occurring a delay in the process of switching to Wi Fi communications can be merited. Relatedly a further criterion that can be considered is whether the mobile device is off peak in its use. If this is the case it can be an opportune moment for Wi Fi communications to begin. Additionally in some cases further preliminary criteria that are considered by the mobile device can include one or more of i whether an access point of interest such as the first access point has ever been used before by the mobile device for Wi Fi communications ii whether that access point is whitelisted and or iii whether that access point is blacklisted.

If at the step it is determined that the preliminary criteria are not met then the process advances to a step at which the mobile device continues to proceed with normal WAN based e.g. 3G communications or data connectivity involving the cellular network and the process then ends at a step . Alternatively if at the step it is determined that the preliminary criteria have been met then the process advances to a step . At this step the mobile device automatically without user awareness launches a browser program such as the browser program of and attempts to establish communications with an access point having a coverage region in which the mobile device is located such as the first access point associated with the first coverage region and correspondingly the third communication link is established.

More particularly with respect to the attempt to establish communications at the step this can in some cases though need not always be precipitated by a user of the mobile device entering a web address into the browser program with an intent to access a website associated with that web address e.g. a website hosted at a web server such as the web server unaffiliated with the first access point . Nevertheless the step does not itself represent an attempt to establish communications with a web server such as the web server that is unassociated with the first access point . Rather the step constitutes an attempt by the mobile device to establish communications with an access point such as the first access point itself or perhaps with another component of the WLAN with which that first access point is associated. More particularly the activity occurring at the step typically involves communications between the browser program and the first access point such as contacting the IP address of the AP web server residing on or otherwise associated with the access point.

Execution of the step is significant because in some circumstances communications via a Wi Fi network such as the Wi Fi network is constrained by use requirements established by the owner or operator of the Wi Fi network or the access point s that are part of and allow accessing of that network. Such use requirements can be encountered by the mobile device as requirements of the web server s residing on or associated with e.g. residing elsewhere on the WLAN those access point s such as the AP web server . Often addressing such use requirements is mandatory before the mobile device can proceed with regular Wi Fi communications via the access point. Indeed even if the mobile device is attempting to access another web address e.g. that of the web server the mobile device can be forcibly re directed to the IP address of access point e.g. the AP web server to address the use requirements before the accessing of the other web address can proceed. In this context the web server associated with the access point can be considered a re direct server since the mobile device is re directed to that server irrespective of any earlier instruction.

Assuming that in establishing communications with an access point such as the first access point the mobile device is directed to a web server of that access point such as the AP web server or a re direct server captive portal as discussed above which can in some circumstances be located elsewhere other than at the access point itself then at the step in the present embodiment the browser program of the mobile device additionally utilizes known scripts to access identify and or otherwise interact with standard screens e.g. web pages of that web server so as to address use requirements or other issues. In the present embodiment the browser program particularly determines whether communication with the first access point can be on a free basis or instead needs to be on a paid basis. Also in the present embodiment the browser program identifies any terms or conditions e.g. other requirements that need to be met in order for communications with the first access point to proceed.

Given this to be the case upon taking such action at the step the mobile device in the present embodiment then takes several further actions to address the use requirements or other issues raised by the AP web server of the first access point . More particularly at a subsequent step the mobile device makes a determination of whether further communications via the first access point as indicated by the information obtained during the step can proceed on a free basis or instead can only proceed on a paid basis. As shown if it is determined that the communications can only proceed on a paid basis then the process advances from the step again to the step . Consequently normal WAN based communications via the cellular network continue to occur and then the process ends at the end step . Alternatively if it is determined that the communications can proceed on a free non paying basis then the process further proceeds from the step to a step .

Upon reaching the step the mobile device particularly by way of the browser program further determines whether there are any particular terms or conditions associated with communications via the first access point as identified at the step that should be addressed before further communications via the first access point and the Wi Fi network can proceed. If there are no terms or conditions that should be addressed before communications with the Wi Fi network via the first access point can occur then the process advances to a step . However if there are one or more terms or conditions that should be addressed before communications with the Wi Fi network can proceed the process advances to a step at which the mobile device then further determines whether all such terms or conditions can be addressed on an automatic basis without further input from the mobile device user. If this is in fact the case then the process advances from the step to a step at which all of the term s or condition s that should be addressed are automatically addressed by the mobile device via the browser program .

As further indicated by the step user interaction need not always be required in addressing term s and condition s associated with establishing communications with the Wi Fi network even where addressing such term s or condition s involves more than a trivial nonsubstantive issue. In particular if the access point has been utilized previously it is possible that the mobile device will have available to it various recorded e.g. cached response information or other information that can be used to address the term s or condition s at issue such that the mobile device is able to automatically respond to the terms or conditions requirements. In some cases such cached or other stored response information available at the mobile device can be information that was obtained at an earlier time when the mobile device previously addressed the same term s or condition s such as when the mobile device previously tried to establish communications with the Wi Fi network via the same access point e.g. via the first access point . Regardless of the manner in which term s or condition s are automatically addressed at the step the process then again advances to the step .

If at the step however it is determined that there are one or more terms or conditions that should be addressed before communications with the Wi Fi network via the first access point can proceed but that one or more of those terms or conditions are one s that cannot be automatically accepted or otherwise addressed the process instead advances from the step to a step . At the step the browser program provides an alert to the mobile device user displayed on the display screen of the mobile device for example indicating that the user needs to accept a given term or condition or take some other action e.g. provide additional input information in order for communications with the Wi Fi network via the first access point to proceed. If the user in response to receiving such alert provides sufficient input to allow for all term s or condition s to be addressed then the process again advances to the step . However if the user fails to do so or fails to do so within a specified time period then the process again proceeds to the step at which the mobile device continues to engage in WAN based connectivity and after which the process ends at the step .

It should be added that as mentioned above with respect to the step in at least some embodiments in which terms or conditions are addressed automatically this is able to occur because past user input information has been stored e.g. cached . Given the value of such stored e.g. cached information during execution of the step in certain circumstances it should be recognized that the information input by a user at the step in at least some embodiments is as part of that step stored on the mobile device e.g. within the memory portion for later use when the process of is repeated and the step is performed.

Assuming that the process advances to the step from any of the steps or the mobile device ceases to communicate via the cellular network that is the WAN based e.g. 3G connectivity is dropped broken. At the same time or substantially the same time the mobile device begins to communicate via the Wi Fi network particularly by way of the first access point establishing the first coverage region within which the mobile device is positioned. When this occurs in cases where the browser program of the mobile device was previously directed to a re direct server such as the AP web server notwithstanding an initial request to proceed to the web address of another web server such as the web server the mobile device is allowed finally to proceed to the initially requested web server. Upon commencing communications via the Wi Fi network the process then is shown to end at the step . That said it will be understood that communications via the Wi Fi network can continue on indefinitely until the information desired for transmission e.g. the content or the software update is fully communicated to or from the mobile device .

In considering the operations of the flow chart it should be noted that operations such as those of the steps in which requirements of a re direct server captive portal are automatically addressed by comparison with operations involving user input such as the step can be particularly beneficial in that the mobile device is able to relatively rapidly proceed to communications with the Wi Fi network . More particularly due to such rapid transitioning it is possible for one or more applications e.g. email applications involving communications with a SNW etc. running on the mobile device that wish to use the IP connection via the Wi Fi network to continue running e.g. by entering into communication with the web server without timing out due to any absence of full connectivity. By comparison if user input is required such as at the step the precluding of such timing out may not always be possible if it takes too long to receive the appropriate user input. Then again in other circumstances timing out of applications on the mobile device need not be a problem even where user input is required to proceed to the extent that full WAN based communications are maintained throughout the process up to the step .

Although not shown it should also be understood that communications via the Wi Fi network can also be terminated and connectivity via the cellular network can be restored at a time subsequent to the step . Such switching back from Wi Fi communications to WAN based communications can occur for example at a time after a desired information transmission has been completed e.g. after the content of interest or software update has been fully communicated to its destination at a predetermined time e.g. a predetermined amount of time after communications with the Wi Fi network began or at a time when communications via the Wi Fi network become impossible or undesirably poor e.g. because a QoS criterion is no longer met or because the mobile device has moved out of the first coverage region . Indeed it should be understood that the switching back and forth between WAN based and Wi Fi communications involving the steps shown in as well as other steps occurring after the step e.g. steps involving switching back from Wi Fi communications to WAN based communications can be repeated over and over again.

Further even though Wi Fi communications via one access point such as the first access point may occur and then be terminated when the mobile device leaves the first coverage region established by that access point Wi Fi communications can again be re established when the mobile device enters other coverage region s such as a coverage region not shown established by the second access point . Indeed the process of can be repeated on multiple occasions in relation to multiple access points as the mobile device enters and or exits coverage regions associated with those access points. Although not intended to be the primary focus of it also should be understood that WAN based communications via the cellular network can stop and start as the mobile device enters and or exits coverage regions associated with cell towers such as the first coverage region associated with the first cell tower . However in contrast to the coverage regions associated with different access points which may not be contiguous or overlap the coverage regions associated with different cell towers typically are configured to be contiguous overlap such that the mobile device need not start and stop cellular communications for this reason.

Although not shown in it will further be understood that in some embodiments a mobile device can potentially enter into communications with any of several access points while at a given location. In some such embodiments multiple respective use requirements can exist with respect to the respective different access points all of which are accessible by the same mobile device. For example in some embodiments the mobile device can potentially access multiple e.g. n access points and any IP address contacted can be one of several e.g. n IP addresses respectively associated with the respective access points. In some such circumstances the preliminary criteria considered at the step can be considered with respect to each of several different access points and the IP address es contacted at the step can be ones associated with the access point s for which preliminary criteria have been considered and determined to be met at the step . Likewise in some such circumstances the mobile device can determine whether the additional criteria considered at the steps are satisfied with respect to more than one access point and proceed to communicate with one or more particular access point s depending upon these determinations.

Turning to the schematic diagram shows additional example operation of the system of . In particular as will be discussed further below the process of finds particular application in regards to the communication of software updates such as the software update to mobile devices such as the mobile device from a source of such information such as the web server . As already discussed with respect to the web server can take a variety of forms depending upon the embodiment and need not even be a web server per se . For purposes of the present embodiment it is assumed that the web server is configured to serve as an intermediary between mobile devices such as the mobile device and other devices for example one or more CPWs and also to serve as a source of software updates.

Further in this regard the web server can be but need not be a device management DM server that employs a separate or distinct protocol that is particularly helpful in communicating software upgrade packages as well as possibly various parameters device information and settings . As will be discussed further below assuming that the web server is a DM server a device management session can be used to deliver access point configuration credential information to leverage Wi Fi communications for the delivery of the software update . Further use of the DM server also makes it possible for the system and particularly the mobile device to gain information as to when a software update upgrade is available.

Further with respect to the process represented by the schematic diagram begins at step at which the mobile device is directed or commanded to turn on its Wi Fi communications capability by the web server . That is the web server e.g. DM server sends a command to the mobile device instructing the mobile device to turn on this capability. In providing this command at the step specific service set identifiers SSIDs can be included as part of the command. In at least some circumstances such information is delivered within an Open Mobile Alliance OMA DM session package. It should further noted that in at least some embodiments the step particularly occurs only after the DM server operator detects that a software upgrade such as the software update has become available for a given mobile device or group of mobile devices. In this regard the command provided at the step can be considered a trigger to the mobile device indicating that a software update is available and that the mobile device should begin the process of establishing Wi Fi communications so as to allow downloading of the software update via the Wi Fi communications link. Further once the availability of the software upgrade is detected the DM server queues the software upgrade until such time as the mobile device responds to the command provided at the step by establishing Wi Fi connectivity.

Following the step at additional steps and the mobile device further communicates with the web server regarding credential information. The additional steps and can be considered optional and in some embodiments are not performed for that reason the arrows corresponding to the steps and are shown to be dashed . Nevertheless in the present embodiment at the additional step the mobile device sends a message to the web server in which the mobile device requests credentials of the web server. Then at the additional step the web server responds with the requested credential information. Although not shown depending upon the type of credential information or the characteristics of the credential information provided from the web server at the additional step the mobile device can decide to proceed or not proceed with further actions resulting in connectivity by way of the Wi Fi network and potentially if ultimately Wi Fi connectivity is not pursued remain connected to the cellular network .

Although not shown in depending upon the embodiment additional techniques can also be or instead be employed by the mobile device in determining whether to proceed with Wi Fi connectivity. For example the mobile device can operate so that one or more ports are blocked such that the Wi Fi connectivity is used only for the purpose of receiving software upgrades such as the software update but not for other types of data communications such as communication of the content . Also as indicated by the points A and B shown in in at least some embodiments one or more of the steps of can be performed that is between the points A and B as part of the process represented by subsequent to the step to determine whether the mobile device should or can enter into Wi Fi connectivity with an access point such as the first access point so as to allow for further communications with the web DM server via the Wi Fi network .

Subsequent to the step and subsequent to any additional steps mentioned above such as those of steps of at a step the mobile device then provides the web DM server with a notification that the mobile device has Wi Fi connectivity suitable for transmission of the software update . Further as shown upon completion of the step then at a step the software update upgrade package is transmitted to the mobile device . As a result of the receiving of the software update existing software program s stored in the memory portion of the mobile device which can be understood to include but not be limited to the browser program is are supplemented by and or modified by including replaced or deleted the software update information. Further at a step an acknowledgment is sent back from the mobile device for receipt by the web DM server that the software update has been delivered. Finally at a step once the software update has been communicated to the mobile device and the acknowledgment has been provided back to the web server indicating such communication then at the step the mobile device is instructed by the web server to disable Wi Fi communications and thus correspondingly to revert to the original e.g. cellular connectivity.

From the above discussion therefore it should be appreciated that the process for allowing software updates such as the software update to be communicated to a mobile device by way of Wi Fi connectivity instead of WAN based connectivity can in some embodiments entail one or more steps that are different from those of the process of . Such steps can be particularly warranted since in such circumstances the web server can have a special relationship with the mobile device for example where the operator of the web server is the manufacturer of the mobile device and has particularly relevant information regarding when software upgrades are arriving that can be of value to the mobile device. At the same time notwithstanding the above discussion it should be understood that a variety of implementations and processes are intended to be encompassed by the above disclosure and the above embodiments are merely exemplary.

Therefore it is specifically intended that the present invention not be limited to the embodiments and illustrations contained herein but include modified forms of those embodiments including portions of the embodiments and combinations of elements of different embodiments as come within the scope of the following claims.
