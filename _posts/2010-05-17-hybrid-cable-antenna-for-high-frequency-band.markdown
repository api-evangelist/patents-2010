title: Hybrid cable antenna for high frequency band
abstract: A hybrid cable antenna includes a first cable antenna that is buoyant and unloaded for operation in a lower portion of the high frequency band. At least one second cable antenna is serially and electrically coupled to the first cable antenna. Each second cable antenna is buoyant and loaded for operation in a portion of the high frequency band that is above the lower portion of the high frequency band.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates generally to cable antennas and more particularly to a buoyant cable antenna that operates through out the entire high frequency band.

Buoyant cable antennas are generally used for submarine communication when a submarine is submerged below periscope depth. Currently separate antennas are generally used for separate communications frequency bands. A more broadband buoyant cable antenna known as the legacy antenna achieves a compromise between very low frequency low frequency VLF LF performance and high frequency HF performance. However when HF performance is important the HF gain provided by the legacy antenna is frequently inadequate.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a buoyant cable antenna for operation throughout the entire high frequency band.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a buoyant cable antenna whose gain can be readily optimized across the entire high frequency band.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.

In accordance with the present invention a buoyant cable antenna for operation in the high frequency band has a first cable antenna that is buoyant and unloaded for operation in a lower portion of the high frequency band. At least one second cable antenna is serially and electrically coupled to the first cable antenna. Each second cable antenna is buoyant and capacitively loaded for operation in a portion of the high frequency band that is above the lower portion of the high frequency band handled by the first cable antenna.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to a hybrid buoyant cable antenna capable of operation throughout the entire high frequency band is shown and is referenced generally by numeral . The term high frequency band as used herein refers to the frequency band that is generally accepted to range from approximately 3 MHz to approximately 30 MHz as is well known in the art. However it is to be understood that the term high frequency band also applies to frequency band definitions extending to frequencies below above the generally accepted 3 30 MHz range limits.

Buoyant cable antenna is capable of functioning as several separate antennas each in its own frequency range by virtue of having multiple antenna sections. These sections include an unloaded section that operates in a lower portion of the high frequency band and one or more loaded sections that operate in corresponding one or more upper portions of the high frequency band. As will be explained further below buoyant cable antenna has no active devices and can be used to receive or transmit signals in the high frequency band. Accordingly buoyant cable antenna will be coupled to transmission and or reception electronics the particular design of which is not a limitation of the present invention. Unloaded section is located closest to electronics with loaded section s being serially coupled to unloaded section .

Since buoyant cable antenna will typically be deployed from a sea going vessel buoyant cable antenna is made to be buoyant. Further since buoyant cable antenna is typically stored and deployed from a reel buoyant cable antenna must be flexible. Accordingly embodiments of buoyant cable antenna described herein will present constructions having both buoyant and flexible attributes.

Referring now to an embodiment of unloaded section is illustrated. More specifically unloaded section is defined by a length Lof a flexible buoyant and electronically insulting jacket that completely encases a single conducting wire along its length. Jacket can be made from a variety of suitable materials such as polyethylene foam or other closed cell foams. Wire can be any electrically conductive material such as copper or silver. The length Lof unloaded section is chosen manipulated based on a desired gain profile for buoyant cable antenna . In general length Lis selected such that unloaded section does not interfere with loaded section s .

Since unloaded section and loaded section s operate at different portions of the high frequency band it may be desirable to separate and electronically connect them using a bandpass filter designed to pass block the relevant frequencies. Accordingly illustrates another embodiment of the present invention where a bandpass filter electrically connects loaded section to loaded section s . Such bandpass filters and their construction are well understood in the art.

In its simplest embodiment buoyant cable antenna has one unloaded section covering a lower portion of the high frequency band and one loaded section covering the remaining upper portion of the high frequency band. However in order to optimize the buoyant cable antenna in its various operating frequency ranges it may be desirable to design and construct the buoyant cable antenna with multiple loaded sections . In this type of embodiment each loaded section is optimized for a portion of the high frequency band where each portion defines a unique and non overlapping range of frequencies that is greater than that covered by unloaded section . For example illustrates an embodiment of the present invention that includes two loaded sections A and B. It is to be understood that additional capacatively loaded sections could be added in serial fashion without departing from the scope of the present invention.

Loaded section A is optimized for a portion of the high frequency band above the lower portion thereof defined by unloaded section by manipulating the section s length L capacitor spacing d and capacitance value C. Similarly loaded section B is optimized for its portion of the high frequency band also above the lower portion thereof defined by unloaded section by manipulating the section s length L capacitance spacing d and capacitance value C. In addition sections A and B are designed such that the range of frequencies defined thereby increases with distance from unloaded section so that the highest portion of the high frequency band is handled by the loaded section that is furthest from unloaded section . Since each of loaded sections A and B is designed optimized for a particular frequency range loaded sections A and B could also be separated coupled by a bandpass filter .

The advantages of the present invention are numerous. A single hybrid cable antenna can be designed and optimized for the entire high frequency band with each section being optimized for a portion of the high frequency band. The divisions between the unloaded and loaded section s can also be used to provide a shunt path connection for VLF LF transmission reception of signals through the water.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
