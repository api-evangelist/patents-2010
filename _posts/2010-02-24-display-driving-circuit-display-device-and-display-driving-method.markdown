The present invention relates to driving of display devices such as liquid crystal display devices having active matrix liquid crystal display panels and in particular to a display driving circuit and a display driving method for driving a display panel in a display device employing a drive system referred to as CC charge coupling driving.

A conventional CC driving system that is employed in an active matrix liquid crystal display device is disclosed for example in Patent Literature 1. CC driving is explained by taking as an example the content of disclosure in Patent Literature 1.

As shown in the liquid crystal display device that carries out CC driving includes an image display section a source line driving circuit a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit .

The image display section includes a plurality of source lines signal lines a plurality of gate lines scanning lines switching elements pixel electrodes a plurality of CS capacity storage bus lines common electrode lines retention capacitors liquid crystals and a counter electrode . The switching elements are disposed near points of intersection between the plurality of source lines and the plurality of gate lines respectively. The pixel electrodes are connected to the switching elements respectively.

The CS bus lines are paired with the gate lines respectively and arrange in parallel with one another. Each of the retention capacitor has one end connected to a pixel electrode and the other end connected to a CS bus line . The counter electrode is provided in such a way as to face the pixel electrodes with the liquid crystals sandwiched therebetween.

The source line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the source lines and the gate line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the gate lines . Further the CS bus line driving circuit is provided so as to drive the CS bus lines .

Each of the switching elements is formed by amorphous silicon a Si polycrystalline silicon p Si monocrystalline silicon c Si and the like. Because of such a structure a capacitor is formed between the gate and the drain of the switching element . This capacitor causes a phenomenon in which a gate pulse signal from a gate line shifts the potential of a pixel electrode toward a negative side.

As shown in the potential Vg of a gate line in the liquid crystal display device is Von only during an H period horizontal scanning period in which the gate line is selected and retained at Voff during the other periods. The potential Vs of a source line varies in amplitude depending on an video signal to be displayed but takes a waveform that inverts its polarity every H period centered on the counter electrode potential Vcom and reverses its polarity in an adjacent H period concerning the same gate line line inversion driving . Since it is assumed in that a uniform video signal is being inputted the potential Vs changes with constant amplitude.

The potential Vd of the pixel electrode is equal to the potential Vs of the source line because the switching element conducts during a period in which the potential Vg is Von and at the moment the potential Vg becomes Voff the potential Vd shifts slightly toward a negative side through the gate drain capacitor .

The potential Vc of a CS bus line is Ve during an H period in which the corresponding gate line is selected and the next H period. Further the potential Vc switches to Ve during the H period after the next and then retained at Ve until the next field. This switching causes the potential Vd to be shifted toward a negative side through the retention capacitor .

In the result the potential Vd changes with larger amplitude than the potential Vs therefore the amplitude of change in the potential Vs can be made smaller. This allows achieving a simplification of circuitry and a reduction of power consumption in the source line driving circuit .

The liquid crystal display device employing line inversion driving and CC driving has such a problem that in the first frame after the start of a display there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row every single horizontal line of the liquid crystal display device .

In GSP is a gate start pulse signal that defines a timing of vertical scanning and GCK CK and GCK CKB are gate clock signals that are outputted from the control circuit to define a timing of operation of the shift register. A period from a falling edge to the next falling edge in GSP corresponds to a single vertical scanning period 1V period . A period from a rising edge in GCK to a rising edge in GCK and a period from a rising edge GCK to a rising edge in GCK each correspond to a single horizontal scanning period 1H period . CMI is a polarity signal that reverses its polarity every single horizontal scanning period.

Further shows the following signals in the order named a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source line driving circuit to a source line source line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS which is supplied from the CS bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and a potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. Similarly shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and a potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. Furthermore shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the third row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the third row and a potential Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the third row and the xth column.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix indicate the potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. In the initial state the source line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are all in the preparatory stages or in a resting state before entering into normal operation. Therefore the gate signals G G and G are fixed at a gate off potential potential at which the gate of a switching element is turned off and the CS signals CS CS and CS are fixed at one potential e.g. at a low level .

In the first frame after the initial state the source line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are all in normal operation. This causes the source signal S to be a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 1H period.

It should be noted that since it is assumed in that a uniform picture is displayed the amplitude of the source signal S is constant. Meanwhile the gate signals G G and G serve as gate on potentials at which the gates of the switching elements are turned on during the first second and third 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS CS and CS are reversed after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall and take such waveforms that they are opposite in direction of reversal to one another. Specifically in an odd numbered frame the CS signal CS rises after its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall. Further in an even numbered frame the CS signal CS falls after its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall.

It should be noted that the relationship between rising and falling edges in the CS signals CS CS and CS in the odd numbered and even numbered frames may be opposite of the relationship stated above. Further the timing of inversion of the CS signals CS CS and CS may be the falling edges in the gate signals G G and G or later i.e. the corresponding horizontal scanning periods or later. For example the CS signals CS CS and CS may be inverted in synchronization with rising edges in gate signals in the next row.

However since in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS are all fixed at one potential in at a low level in the initial state the potentials Vpix and Vpix are placed in an irregular state. Specifically the CS signal CS behaves in the same way as in the other odd numbered frames third fifth frame . . . in that it rises after the corresponding gate signal G falls but the CS signals CS and CS behave differently from the other odd numbered frames third fifth frame . . . in that they are retained at the same potential in at a low level after the corresponding gate signals G and G fall.

For this reason in the first frame there occurs a change in potential of the CS signal CS as usual in the pixel electrodes in the second row. Therefore while the potential Vpix is subjected to a potential shift caused by a change in potential of the CS signal CS there occur no changes in potential of the CS signals CS and CS in the pixel electrodes in the first and third rows. Accordingly the potentials Vpix and Vpix are not subjected to a potential shift as indicated by shaded areas in . In the result despite inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale there occurs a difference in luminance between the first and third rows and the second row due to a difference between the potentials Vpix and Vpix and the potential Vpix. This difference in luminance appears as a difference in luminance between an odd numbered row and an even numbered row in the image display section as a whole. Therefore there appear alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row in a picture in the first frame.

A technology capable of suppressing the appearance of such transverse stripes is disclosed in Patent Literature 2. The technology of Patent Literature 2 is described below with reference to . is a block diagram showing a configuration of driving circuits a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit shown in Patent Literature 2. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals of a liquid crystal display device. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the CS bus line driving circuit.

As shown in the CS bus line driving circuit has a plurality of logic circuits . . . corresponding to their respective rows. The logic circuits . . . includes D latch circuits . . . and OR circuits . . . respectively. In the following the logic circuits and which correspond to the first and second rows respectively are taken as an example.

Input signals to the logic circuit are the gate signals G and G a polarity signal POL and a rest signal RESET and input signals to the logic circuits are the gate signals G and G the polarity signal POL and the reset signal REST. The polarity signal POL and the reset signal RESET are inputted from the control circuit not illustrated .

The OR circuit receives the gate signal G from the corresponding gate line and the gate signal G from the gate line of the next row the second row and thereby outputs a signal g shown in . Further the OR circuit receives the gate signal G from the corresponding gate line and the gate signal G from the gate line in the next row the second row and thereby outputs a signal g shown in .

The D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL receives the polarity signal POL via its terminal D and receives the output g via its terminal G from the OR circuit . In accordance with a change in potential level of the signal g from a low level to a high level or from a high level to a low level that the D latch circuit receives via its terminal G the D latch circuit outputs as a CS signal CS an input state of the polarity signal POL that it receives via its terminal D and the CS signal CS indicates the change in potential level. Specifically when the potential level of the signal g that the D latch circuit receives via its terminal G is a high level the latch circuit outputs an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal POL that it receives via its terminal D. When the potential level of the signal g that the latch circuit receives via its terminal G has changed from a high level to a low level the latch circuit latches the input state low level or high level of the polarity signal POL that it received via its terminal D at the time of change and keeps the latched state until the next time when the potential level of the signal g that the latch circuit receives via its terminal G is raised to a high level. Then the D latch circuit outputs the latched state as the CS signal CS shown in which indicates the change in potential level via its terminal Q.

Further similarly the D latch circuit receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL receives the polarity signal POL via its terminal D and receives the output g via its terminal G from the OR circuit . This allows the D latch circuit to output a CS signal CS shown in which indicates a change in potential level via its terminal Q.

The foregoing configuration causes the CS signals CS and CS to be different in potential from each other at points in time where the gate signals in the first and second fall. Therefore as shown in the potential Vpix is subjected to a potential shift caused by a change in potential of the CS signal CS and the potential Vpix is subjected to a potential shift caused by a change in potential of the CS signal CS. This allows eliminating such alternate bright and dark transverse stripes every single row as those shown in .

However the technology of Patent Literature 2 needs to load a gate signal from the current row and a gate signal from the next row to generate a CS signal shown in thus causing such a problem that the circuit area increases. To put it in the example described above the CS signal CS from the logic circuit is generated by using the gate signal g from the gate line in the second row and a gate signal g from the gate line in the third row. This makes it necessary to provide a wire through which the gate signal g from the gate line in the third row is loaded and a circuit OR circuit that takes the logic of the gate signals g and g thus causing an increase in circuit area. Such a driving circuit makes it difficult to provide a liquid crystal display panel with a narrow frame.

The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing problems and it is an object of the present invention to provide a display driving circuit and a display driving method which without causing an increase in circuit area make it possible to improve the quality of a display by eliminating the appearance of transverse stripes.

A display driving circuit according to the present invention is a display driving circuit for use in a display device in which by supplying retention capacitor wire signals to retention capacitor wires forming capacitors with pixel electrodes included in pixels signal potentials written into the pixel electrodes are changed in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials the display driving circuit including a shift register including a plurality of stages provided in such a way as to correspond to a plurality of scanning signal lines respectively the display driving circuit having retaining circuits provided in such a way as to correspond one by one to the stages of the shift register a retention target signal being inputted to each of the retaining circuits when a control signal generated by a current stage of the shift register becomes active a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage loading and retaining the retention target signal an output signal from the current stage of the shift register being supplied as a scanning signal to a scanning signal line connected to pixels corresponding to the current stage an output from a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage being supplied as the retention capacitor wire signal to a retention capacitor wire forming capacitors with pixel electrodes of pixels corresponding to a previous stage preceding the current stage.

A display panel that is driven by the display driving circuit is configured as described above and a typical arrangement thereof is for example is such that a large number of pixel electrodes are arranged in rows and columns that a scanning signal line a switching element and a retention capacitor wire are arranged along each row and that a data signal line is arranged along each column. Although in this typical arrangement the terms rows and columns or the terms horizontal and vertical often refer to arrangements along the transverse and longitudinal directions of the display panel respectively it does not need to be that way the horizontal and vertical relationship may be reversed. As such the terms the terms rows and columns or the terms horizontal and vertical are not to define any directions in particular.

The display driving circuit that drives this display panel uses retention capacitor wire signals to cause signal potentials written into the pixel electrodes to change in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials whereby CC driving is achieved.

It should be noted here that a retention capacitor wire signal as described above takes such a waveform as to reverse its potential after the nth row gate signal falls goes off . Conventionally such a waveform of a retention capacitor wire signal is generated by employing a configuration using the nth row gate signal and the n 1 th row gate signal see . Such a configuration makes it necessary to provide wires through which the nth and n 1 th row shift register outputs gate signals are loaded and a logic circuit OR circuit thus causing an increase in circuit area.

In this respect the display driving circuit is configured such that a retention capacitor wire signal is generated by inputting a control signal internal signal or output signal generated by a current stage of the shift register to a retention circuit of the current stage and the retention capacitor wire signal is supplied to a retention capacitor wire corresponding to a previous stage. This allows elimination of such irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes in the first vertical scanning period thus bringing about an effect of improving the quality of a display by preventing the appearance of transverse stripes in the first vertical scanning period. Further because it is not necessary to provide a separate element for generating a proper retention capacitor wire signal it is possible to make the circuit area smaller than in the conventional configuration. This allows achieving a small sized liquid crystal display device and a liquid crystal display panel with a narrow frame both with high display quality.

A display driving method according to the present invention is a display driving method for driving a display device which includes a shift register including a plurality of stages provided in such a way as to correspond to a plurality of scanning signal lines respectively and in which by supplying retention capacitor wire signals to retention capacitor wires forming capacitors with pixel electrodes included in pixels signal potentials written into the pixel electrodes are changed in a direction corresponding to polarities of the signal potentials the display driving method including the steps of inputting a retention target signal to retaining circuits provided in such a way as to correspond to the stages of the shift register respectively and when a control signal generated by a current stage of the shift register becomes active causing a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage to load and retain the retention target signal and supplying an output signal from the current stage of the shift register as a scanning signal to a scanning signal line connected to pixels corresponding to the current stage and supplying an output from a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage as the retention capacitor wire signal to a retention capacitor wire forming capacitors with pixel electrodes of pixels corresponding to a previous stage preceding the current stage.

As with the effect mentioned above in relation to the display driving circuit the method brings about an effect of without causing an increase in circuit area improving the quality of a display by eliminating the appearance of transverse stripes in the first vertical scanning period.

As described above a display driving circuit and a display driving method according to the present invention are such that retaining circuits are provided in such a way as to correspond one by one to the stages of the shift register a retention target signal is inputted to each of the retaining circuits when a control signal generated by a current stage of the shift register becomes active a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage loads and retains the retention target signal an output signal from the current stage of the shift register is supplied as a scanning signal to a scanning signal line connected to pixels corresponding to the current stage and an output from a retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage is supplied as the retention capacitor wire signal to a retention capacitor wire forming capacitors with pixel electrodes of pixels corresponding to a previous stage preceding the current stage.

The configuration and method can bring about an effect of without causing an increase in circuit area improving display quality by eliminating the problem of appearance of alternate bright and dart transverse stripes every single low single line in the first vertical scanning period first frame in which to start to output a data signal corresponding to a picture to be displayed.

First a configuration of a liquid crystal display device corresponding to a display device of the present invention is described with reference to . is a block diagram showing an overall configuration of the liquid crystal display device and is an equivalent circuit diagram showing an electrical configuration of each pixel of the liquid crystal display device .

The liquid crystal display device includes an active matrix liquid crystal display panel which corresponds to a display panel of the present invention a source bus line driving circuit which corresponds to a data signal line driving circuit of the present invention a gate line driving circuit which corresponds to a scanning signal line driving circuit of the present invention a CS bus line driving circuit which corresponds to a retention capacitor wire driving circuit of the present invention and a control circuit which corresponds to a control circuit of the present invention.

The liquid crystal display panel constituted by sandwiching liquid crystals between an active matrix substrate and a counter substrate not illustrated has a large number of pixels P arranged in rows and columns.

Moreover the liquid crystal display panel includes source bus lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to data signal lines of the present invention gate lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to scanning signal lines of the present invention thin film transistors hereinafter referred to as TFTs provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to switching element of the present invention pixel electrodes provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to pixel electrodes of the present invention CS bus lines provided on the active matrix substrate which correspond to retention capacitor wires of the present invention and a counter electrode provided on the counter substrate. It should be noted that each of the TFTs omitted from is shown in alone.

The source bus lines are arranged one by one in columns in parallel with one another along a column wise direction longitudinal direction and the gate lines are arranged one by one in rows in parallel with one another along a row wise direction transverse direction . The TFTs are each provided in correspondence with a point of intersection between a source bus line and a gate line so are the pixel electrodes . Each of the TFTs has its source electrode s connected to the source bus line its gate electrode g connected to the gate line and its drain electrode d connected to a pixel electrode . Further each of the pixel electrode forms a liquid crystal capacitor with the counter electrode with liquid crystals sandwiched between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode .

With this when a gate signal scanning signal supplied to the gate line causes the gate of the TFT to be on and a source signal data signal from the source bus line is written into the pixel electrode the pixel electrode is given a potential corresponding to the source signal. In the result the potential corresponding to the source signal is applied to the liquid crystals sandwiched between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode . This allows realization of a gray scale display corresponding to the source signal.

The CS bus lines are arranged one by one in rows in parallel with one another along a row wise direction transverse direction in such a way as to be paired with the gate lines respectively. The CS bus lines each form a retention capacitor referred to also as auxiliary capacitor with each one of the pixel electrodes arranged in each row thereby being capacitively coupled to the pixel electrodes .

It should be noted that since because of its structure the TFT has a pull in capacitor formed between the gate electrode g and the drain electrode d the potential of the pixel electrode is affected pulled in by a change in potential of the gate line . However for simplification of explanation such an effect is not taken into consideration here.

The liquid crystal display panel thus configured is driven by the source bus line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit . Further the control circuit supplies the source bus line driving circuit the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit with various signals that are necessary for driving the liquid crystal display panel .

In the present embodiment during an active period effective scanning period in a vertical scanning period that is periodically repeated each row is allotted a horizontal scanning period in sequence and scanned in sequence. For that purpose in synchronization with a horizontal scanning period in each row the gate line driving circuit sequentially outputs a gate signal for turning on the TFTs to the gate line in that row. The gate line driving circuit will be described in detail later.

The source bus line driving circuit outputs a source signal to each source bus line . This source signal is obtained by the source bus line driving circuit receiving a video signal from an outside of the liquid crystal display device via the control circuit allotting the video signal to each column and giving the video signal a boost or the like.

Further for example in order to carry out n line nH inversion driving the source bus line driving circuit is configured such that the polarity of the source signal it outputs is identical for all pixels in an identical row and reversed every adjacent n rows. For example as shown in which shows 1 line 1H inversion driving the horizontal scanning period in the first row and the horizontal scanning period in the second row are different in polarity of the source signal S from each other. It should be noted that although the source signal S reverses its polarity every single frame in 1 frame inversion this does not imply any limitation. The source signal S may reverse its polarity every m frames m frame inversion .

The CS bus line driving circuit outputs a CS signal corresponding to a retention capacitor wire signal of the present invention to each CS bus line . This CS signal is a signal whose potential switches rises or falls between two values high and low potentials and is controlled such that the potential at a point in time where the TFTs in the corresponding row are switched from on to off i.e. at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every n adjacent rows. The CS bus line driving circuit will be described in detail later.

The control circuit controls the gate line driving circuit the source bus line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit thereby causing each of them to output signals as shown in .

In the present embodiment attention should be paid to the features of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit among those members which constitute the liquid crystal display device . In the following the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are described in detail Embodiments 1 to 3 .

Further shows the following signals a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source bus line driving circuit to a source bus line source bus line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS CSOUT which is supplied from the CS bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. Further shows the following signals a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS CSOUT which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. Furthermore shows the following signals a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the third row a CS signal CS CSOUT which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the third row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the third row and the xth column. As will described later with reference to the signals M CSR M CSR and M CSR generated by the shift register circuits SR to SR in the first to third rows are signals that are inputted to the logic circuits latch circuits retaining circuits CSL to CSL in the first to third rows respectively.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix indicate the potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. In Embodiment 1 as shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS CS and CS are all fixed at one potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row and the CS signal CS in the third row switch from a low level to a high level in synchronization with rising edges in their corresponding gate signals G and G respectively and are at a high level at points in time where the gate signals G and G fall. Therefore the potential of a CS signal in each row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls is different from the potential of a CS signal in an adjacent row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls. For example the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a low level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every 1H period. Further since it is assumed in that a uniform picture is displayed the amplitude of the source signal S is constant. Meanwhile the gate signals G G and G serve as gate on potentials during the first second and third 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS CS and CS are reversed after their corresponding gate signals G G and G fall and take such waveforms that adjacent rows are opposite in direction of reversal to each other. Specifically in an odd numbered frame first frame third frame . . . the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall and the CS signal CS rises after its corresponding gate signal G falls. Further in an even numbered frame second frame fourth frame . . . the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall and the CS signal CS falls after its corresponding gate signal G falls.

It should be noted that the relationship between rising and falling edges in the CS signals CS CS and CS in the odd numbered and even numbered frames may be opposite of the relationship stated above.

Since in adjacent rows are different from each other in terms of the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals fall in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS in the first frame takes the same waveforms as in a normal odd numbered frame e.g. the third frame . Therefore since the potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS CS and CS respectively inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative potential differences between the potential of the counter electrode and the shifted potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal of a negative polarity is written into the odd numbered pixels in the same column of pixels and a source signal of a positive polarity is written into the even numbered pixels in the same column of pixels the potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the odd numbered pixels are not polarity reversed during the writing into the odd numbered pixels are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the even numbered pixels are not polarity reversed during the writing into the even numbered pixels are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This results in elimination of appearance of transverse stripes in the first frame thus allowing an improvement in display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here. shows a configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit . In the following for convenience of explanation the row line next row following the nth row in a scanning direction indicated by an arrow in is represented as the n 1 th row and the row previous row immediately preceding the nth row in the scanning direction is represented as the n 1 th row.

As shown in the gate line driving circuit has a plurality of shift register circuits SR stages of a shift register corresponding to their respective rows and the CS bus line driving circuit has a plurality of latch circuits retaining circuits CSL corresponding to their respective rows. For convenience of explanation the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SRn 1 and the latch circuits CSLn 1 CSLn and CSLn 1 which correspond to the n 1 th nth and n 1 th rows respectively are taken as an example here.

The shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th row receives the gate clock signal GCK via its clock terminal CK from the control circuit see and receives a shift register output SRBOn 2 from the previous row the n 2 th row via its set terminal SB as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal SB of the shift register circuit SRn of the next row the nth row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to output a shift register output SRBOn 1 via its output terminal OUTB to the shift register circuit SRn. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal M connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn 1 of the current row the n 1 th row via which a signal M generated inside of the shift register circuit SRn 1 is outputted. This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to input its internal signal Mn 1 signal CSRn 1 control signal to the latch circuit CSLn 1.

Further the shift register output SRBOn 2 from the previous row the n 2 th row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn 1 and outputted as a gate signal Gn 1 SROn 2 inversion signal of SRBOn 2 to the gate line of the current row the n 1 th row via a buffer. Further the shift register circuit SRn 1 is supplied with a power supply VDD .

The latch circuit CSLn 1 in the n 1 th row constituted as a D latch circuit receives the polarity signal CMI from the control circuit see and the internal signal Mn 1 signal CSRn 1 from the shift register circuit SRn 1. The latch circuit CSLn 1 has its output terminal OUT connected to the CS bus line of the current row the n 1 th row . This allows the latch circuit CSLn 1 to output a CS signal CSOUTn 1 via its output terminal OUT to the CS bus line of the current row the n 1 th row .

The shift register circuit SRn in the nth receives the gate clock signal GCK row via its clock terminal CK from the control circuit see and receives a shift register output SRBOn 1 from the previous row the n 1 th row via its set terminal SB as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn. The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal SB of the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn to output a shift register output SRBOn via its output terminal OUTB to the shift register circuit SRn 1. The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal M connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn to input its internal signal Mn signal CSRn to the latch circuit CSLn.

Further the shift register output SRBOn 1 from the previous row the n 1 th row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn and outputted as a gate signal Gn SROn 1 inversion signal of SRBOn 1 to the gate line of the current row the nth row via a buffer.

The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal SB of the shift register circuit SRn 2 of the next row the n 2 th row .

The following explains operation of each shift register circuit SR. shows the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SR 1 in the n 1 th nth and n 1 th rows in detail. It should be noted that the shift register circuit SR in each row is identical in configuration to the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SR 1. The following explanation is centered on the shift register circuit SRn in the nth row.

As shown in the shift register circuit SRn includes an RS type flip flop circuit RS FF a NAND circuit and analog switching circuits SW and SW. The flip flop circuit RS FF receives the shift register output SRBOn 1 OUTB via its set terminal SB from the previous row the n 1 th row as a set signal as described above. The NAND circuit has its first input terminal connected to an output terminal QB of the flip flop circuit RS FF and its second input terminal connected to the output terminal OUTB of the shift register circuit SRn. The NAND circuit has its output terminal M connected to control electrodes of the analog switching circuits SW and SW and connected to the clock terminal CK see of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row . The analog switching circuits SW and SW receive from the NAND circuit an internal signal Mn which corresponds to a signal CSRn that controls each of the analog switching circuits SW and SW so that it switches between ON and OFF. The analog switching circuit SW has a first conductive electrode to which the gate clock signal CKB GCK is inputted and a second conductive electrode connected to a first conductive electrode of the analog switching circuit SW and the analog switching circuit SW has a second conductive electrode that is supplied with the power supply VDD . The analog switching circuits SW and SW are connected to each other at a connection point n connected to the output terminal OUTB of the shift register circuit SRn the first input terminal of the NAND circuit and the reset terminal RB of the flip flop circuit RS FF of the current row the nth row . The shift register circuit SRn has it output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal SB of the next row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register output SRBOn OUTB of the current row the nth row to be inputted as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row .

In the foregoing configuration the output OUTB of the shift register circuit SRn is inputted as a reset signal to the reset terminal RB of the flip flop circuit RS FF therefore the shift register circuit SRn functions as a self resetting flip flop. A specific operation of the shift register circuit SRn is described below.

First when the set signal SB SRBOn 1 inputted to the shift register circuit SRn changes from a high level to a low level becomes active the output QB of the flip flop circuit RS FF changes from a high level to a low level and the internal signal Mn which is an output from the NAND circuit changes from a low level to a high level t . When the internal signal Mn has been raised to a high level the analog switching circuit SW is turned on whereby the clock signal CKB is outputted to OUTB. This raises the output signal OUTB to a high level. During a period of time in which the output QB at a low level and the output OUTB at a high level are being inputted to the NAND circuit t to t the NAND circuit outputs the internal signal Mn at a high level whereby the output signal OUTB is raised to a high level. When the set signal SB has been raised to a high level t the clock signal CKB is still at a high level at this point in time. Therefore the flip flop circuit RS FF is not reset whereby the output QB is maintained at a low level and the internal signal Mn and the output signal OUTB are maintained at a high level t to t .

Then when the clock signal CKB has been dropped to a low level t the output signal OUTB is dropped to a low level and the flip flop circuit RS FF is reset whereby the output signal QB changes from a low level to a high level. Since the output signal QB at a high level and the output signal OUTB at a low level are inputted to the NAND circuit the internal signal Mn is maintained at a high level and the output signal OUTB is maintained at a low level t to t . When the clock signal CKB changes from a low level to a high level t the output signal OUTB is raised to a high level and the output signal QB at a high level and the output signal OUTB at a high level are inputted to the NAND circuit so that the internal signal Mn changes from a high level to a low level.

The output OUTB thus generated allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the next row the n 1 row to start an operation and the shift register circuit SRn in the current row the nth row to carry out a reset operation.

It should be noted here that the internal signal Mn which is generated inside of the shift register circuit SRn becomes active in a period of time from a point in time where the set signal SB has become active to a point in time where the reset signal RB CKB becomes active. Moreover the internal signal Mn is inputted to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn in the current row nth row signal CSRn of .

The following explains operation of each latch circuit CSL. shows the latch circuit CSLn in the nth row in detail. It should be noted that the latch circuit CSL in each row is identical in configuration to the latch circuit CSLn. The following explanation refers to the latch circuit CSL in each row as the D latch circuit CSLn.

The D latch circuit CSLn receives the internal signal Mn signal CSRn via its clock terminal CK from the shift register circuit SRn as described above. The D latch circuit CSLn receives the polarity signal CMI via its input terminal D from the control circuit see . This allows the D latch circuit CSLn to output an input state of the polarity signal CMI as a CS signal CSOUTn in accordance with a change in potential level of the internal signal Mn from a low level to a high level or from a high level to a low level and the CS signal CSOUTn indicates the change in potential level. Specifically when the potential level of the internal signal Mn that the D latch circuit CSLn receives via its clock terminal CK is a high level the D latch circuit CSLn outputs an input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it receives via its input terminal D. When the potential level of the internal signal Mn that the D latch circuit CSLn receives via its clock terminal CK has changed from a high level to a low level the D latch circuit CSLn latches the input state low level or high level of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the time of change and keeps the latched state until the next time when the potential level of the internal signal Mn that the D latch circuit CSLn receives via its clock terminal CK is raised to a high level. Then the D latch circuit CSLn outputs the latched state as the CS signal CSOUTn which indicates the change in potential level via its output terminal out.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives a reset signal RESET via its terminal CL see . By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G which corresponds to an output SRO from the shift register circuit SR to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t to t . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level during the period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the second frame from low to high t .

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal M changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the first row. It should be noted that the output in the third frame takes a waveform obtained by reversing the potential level of the output waveform in the second frame and in the fourth frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the second and third frames are alternately outputted.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL see . By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G which corresponds to an output SRO from the shift register circuit SR to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t to t . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level during the period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the second frame from low to high t .

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal M changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the second row. It should be noted that in the third frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the first and second frames are alternately outputted.

Moreover the operations in the first and second rows correspond to operations of the D latch circuits in each odd numbered row and each even numbered row.

Thus the D latch circuits CSL CSL CSL . . . which correspond to their respective rows output CS signals so that in all the frames that include the first frame the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals in their corresponding rows fall at points in time where the TFTs are switched from on to off differ from one row to an adjacent row. This makes it possible to properly operate the CS bus line driving circuit also in the first frame. This allows elimination of such irregular waveforms that cause transverse stripes in the first frame thus bringing about an effect of improving the quality of a display by preventing the appearance of transverse stripes in the first frame.

Further the effect is brought about without causing an increase in circuit area as compared with a conventional liquid crystal display device. is a block diagram showing an example of a configuration of a gate line driving circuit and a CS bus line driving circuit in the conventional liquid crystal display device for achieving the driving of . As shown in the latch circuit in the nth row D latch circuit CSLn receives an output SRBOn 1 from the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the next row the n 1 th row . This causes the CS signal CSn in the nth row to change in potential in synchronization with a rising edge in the gate signal Gn 1 in the n 1 th row see . In this configuration it is necessary to load the shift register output SRBOn 1 from the next row the n 1 th row into the latch circuit CSLn in the current row the nth row . This causes an increase in circuit area due to wiring and the like.

Further as shown in the conventional display driving circuit capable of eliminating the appearance of such transverse stripes requires wires through which the gate signal g from the current row the nth row and the gate signal g from the next row the n 1 th row are loaded and a circuit OR circuit that takes the logic of the gate signals g and g thus causing an increase in circuit area.

In this respect the configuration of Embodiment 1 causes a signal internal signal M generated inside of the shift register circuit SRn to be inputted directly to the latch circuit CSLn of the same row the nth row whereby a proper CS signal CSn is generated which allows eliminating the appearance of such transverse stripes. Therefore as compared with the conventional display driving circuit gate driver CS driver it is possible to dispense with a wire extending from the shift register in the next row nor is it necessary to provide a separate element for generating a proper CS signal CSn. This allows the display driving circuit capable of eliminating the appearance of such transverse stripes to be smaller in circuit area than the conventional configuration thus allowing achieving a small sized liquid crystal display device with high display quality and a liquid crystal display panel with a narrow frame.

In the output SRBOn 1 from the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th row corresponds to the gate signal Gn of the nth row and is supplied to the gate line of the nth line and the internal signal Mn CSRn from the shift register circuit SRn in the nth row is inputted to the latch circuit CSLn of the nth row and the CS signal CSOUTn is supplied to the CS bus line of the nth row. However a configuration shown in is also possible. In the output SRBOn from the shift register circuit SRn in the nth row corresponds to the gate signal Gn of the nth row and is supplied to the gate line of the nth line and the internal signal Mn 1 CSRn 1 from the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th row is inputted to the latch circuit CSLn of the nth row and the CS signal CSOUTn is supplied to the CS bus line of the nth row.

A flip flop circuit according to Embodiment 1 is described here in detail. a of is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a flip flop according to Embodiment 1. As shown in a of the flip flop circuit FF includes a P channel transistor p and an N channel transistor n which constitute a CMOS circuit a P channel transistor p and an N channel transistor n which constitute a CMOS circuit P channel transistors p and p N channel transistors n and n an SB terminal an RB terminal an INITB terminal and Q and QB terminals. The flip flop circuit FF is configured such that the gate of p the gate of n the drain of p the drain of p the drain of n and the QB terminal are connected to one another that the drain of p the drain of n the drain of p the gate of p the gate of n and the Q terminals are connected to one another that the source of n and the drain of n are connected to each other that the source of n and the drain of n are connected to each other that the SB terminal is connected to the gate of p and to the gate of n that the RB terminal is connected to the source of p to the gate of p and to the gate of n that the INITB terminal is connected to the source of p that the sources of p and p are connected to VDD and that the sources of n and n are connected to VSS. It should be noted here that p n p and n constitute a latch circuit LC that p functions as a set transistor ST that p functions a reset transistor RT and that n and n each function as a latch release transistor LRT.

 b of is a timing chart showing operation of FF when the INITB signal is non active and c of is a truth table of FF when the INITB signal is non active . As shown in b and c of the Q signal from FF is Low non active during a period of time in which the SB signal is Low active and the RB signal is Low active is High active during a period of time in which the SB signal is Low active and the RB signal is High non active is Low non active during a period of time in which the SB signal is High non active and the RB signal is Low active and is retained during a period of time in which the SB signal is High non active and the RB signal is High non active .

For example at t in b of Vdd from the RB terminal is outputted to the Q terminal whereby n is turned ON so that Vss Low is outputted to the QB terminal. At t the SB signal is raised to High so that p is turned OFF and n is turned ON whereby the state at t is maintained. At t the RB signal is dropped to Low whereby p is turned ON so that Vdd High is outputted to the QB terminal and furthermore n is turned ON so that Vss is outputted to the Q terminal. It should be noted that when both the SB signal and the RB signal have become Low active p is turned ON so that Vdd High is outputted to the QB terminal and Vss Vth threshold voltage of p is outputted to the Q terminal via p.

Furthermore when the SB signal and the RB signal have become non active during a period of time in which the INITB signal is active the Q and QB signals from FF become non active.

For example let it be assumed that during a period of time in which the INITB signal is Low active there is a change from a state in which the SB signal and the RB signal are both Low active state A to a state in which the SB signal and the RB signal are both High non active state X . In state A p is ON and p is OFF and Vdd High is outputted to the QB terminal and Vss is outputted to the Q terminal. In state X p remains OFF therefore the outputs to the Q and QB terminals are the same as those in state A. Further let it be assumed that during a period of time in which the INITB signal is Low active there is a change from a state in which both the SB signal is High non active and the RB signal is Low active state B to a state in the SB signal and the RB signal are both High non active state X . In state B p and n are turned ON and Vdd High is outputted to the QB terminal and Vss Low is outputted to the Q terminal. In state X p remains OFF therefore the outputs to the Q and QB terminals are the same as those in state B. Furthermore let it be assumed that during a period of time in which the INITB signal is Low active there is a change from a state in which both the SB signal is Low active and the RB signal is High non active state C to a state in the SB signal and the RB signal are both High non active state X . In state C the outputs to the Q and QB terminals becomes indefinite. In state X p is turned ON therefore Vss Vth threshold voltage of p is outputted to the Q terminal and Vdd High is outputted to the QB terminal.

Thus in FF p n p and n two CMOSs constitute a latch circuit and the RB terminal is connected to the gate of p which functions as the reset transistor RT and to the source of p which functions as the set transistor ST and the source of p is connected to the INITB terminal whereby the order of priority of set latch reset SB and RB signals when they become active at the same time is determined and initialization operations are achieved. In FF as described above when the SB signal and the RB signal become active at the same time the RB signal reset is given priority and the output QB becomes non active.

Another embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . For convenience of explanation those members which have the same functions as those described above in Embodiment 1 are given the same reference numerals and are not described below. Further those terms defined in Embodiment 1 are defined in the same way in the present embodiment unless otherwise noted.

In Embodiment 2 as shown in during an initial state as in the case shown in the CS signals CS CS and CS are all fixed at one potential in at a low level . The CS signal CS in the first row and the CS signal CS in the third row switch from a low level to a high level after rising edges in their corresponding gate signals G and G respectively and are at a high level at points in time where the gate signals G and G fall. Therefore the potential of a CS signal in each row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls is different from the potential of a CS signal in an adjacent row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls. For example the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a low level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls.

Thus as in Embodiment 1 adjacent rows are different from each other in terms of the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals fall in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS in the first frame takes the same waveforms as in a normal odd numbered frame e.g. the third frame . Therefore since the potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS CS and CS respectively inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative potential differences between the potential of the counter electrode and the shifted potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. This results in elimination of appearance of transverse stripes in the first frame thus allowing an improvement in display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here. shows a configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit . As in the row line next row following the nth row in a scanning direction indicated by an arrow in is represented as the n 1 th row and the row previous row immediately preceding the nth row in the scanning direction is represented as the n 1 th row.

As shown in the gate line driving circuit has a plurality of shift register circuits SR corresponding to their respective rows and the CS bus line driving circuit has a plurality of latch circuits CSL corresponding to their respective rows. In the following the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SRn 1 and the latch circuits CSLn 1 CSLn and CSLn 1 which correspond to the n 1 th nth and n 1 th rows respectively are taken as an example.

This allows the shift register circuit SRn to output a shift register output SRBOn via its output terminal OUT as a reset signal to the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the previous row and as a set signal to the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row. The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal Q connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn to input an internal signal Qn signal CSRn generated inside thereof to the latch circuit CSLn.

Further the shift register output SRBOn 1 from the previous row the n 1 th row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn and outputted as a gate signal Gn to the gate line of the current row the nth row via a buffer.

The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal OUT connected to the reset terminal R of the shift register circuit SRn of the previous row the nth row and the set terminal S of the shift register circuit SRn 2 of the next row the n 2 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to output a shift register output SRBOn 1 via its output terminal OUT as a reset signal to the shift register circuit SRn of the previous row and as a set signal to the shift register circuit SRn 2 of the next row. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal Q connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn 1 of the current row the n 1 th row .

The following explains operation of each shift register circuit SR. shows the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SR 1 in the n 1 th nth and n 1 th rows in detail. It should be noted that the shift register circuit SR in each row is identical in configuration to the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SR 1. The following explanation is centered on the shift register circuit SRn in the nth row.

As shown in the shift register circuit SRn includes an RS type flip flop circuit RS FF and analog switching circuits SW and SW. The flip flop circuit RS FF receives the shift register output SRBOn 1 OUTB via its set terminal SB from the previous row the n 1 th row as a set signal and the shift register output SRBOn 1 OUTB via its reset terminal RB from the next row the n 1 th row as a rest signal as described above. The flip flop circuit RS FF has its output terminal QB connected to control electrodes of the analog switching circuits SW and SW and connected to the clock terminal CK see of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row . The analog switching circuits SW and SW receive from the flip flop circuit RS FF an internal signal QBn signal CSRn that controls each of the analog switching circuits SW and SW so that it switches between ON and OFF. The analog switching circuit SW has a first conductive electrode to which the gate clock signal CKB GCK is inputted and a second conductive electrode connected to a first conductive electrode of the analog switching circuit SW and the analog switching circuit SW has a second conductive electrode that is supplied with the power supply VDD . The analog switching circuits SW and SW are connected to each other at a connection point n connected to the output OUTB of the shift register circuit SRn. The shift register circuit SRn has it output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal SB of the next row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register output SRBOn OUTB of the current row the nth row to be inputted as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row . Further the shift register circuit SRn has it output terminal OUTB connected to the reset terminal RB of the previous row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register output SRBOn OUTB of the current row the nth row to be inputted as a reset signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the previous row the n 1 th row .

Operation of the shift register circuit SRn is described below. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the shift register circuit SRn.

First when the set signal SRBOn 1 inputted to the shift register circuit SRn changes from a high level to a low level becomes active the output QB internal signal QBn from the flip flop circuit RS FF changes from a high level to a low level t . When the internal signal QBn has been dropped to a low level the analog switching circuit SW is turned on whereby the clock signal CKB at a high level is outputted to OUTB. This causes the output signal OUTB to be at a high level during the period from t to t. When the set signal SB has been raised to a high level t the reset signal RB is still at a high level non active at this point in time. Therefore the flip flop circuit RS FF is not reset whereby the internal signal QBn is maintained at a low level and the output signal OUTB is maintained at a high level t to t . When the clock signal CKB has been dropped to a low level t the analog switching circuit SW is in an on state. Therefore the output signal OUTB is dropped to a low level and this state is maintained during the period from t to t.

Then the reset signal RB outputted from the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the next row the n 1 th row which is inputted to the shift register circuit SRn in the current row the nth row is dropped to a low level active t the flip flop circuit RS FF is reset so that the internal signal QBn changes from a low level to a high level. When the internal signal QBn is raised to a high level t . the analog switching circuit SW is turned off and the switching circuit SW is turned on. This causes VDD high level to be outputted to OUTB and the output signal OUTB to be raised to a high level.

The output OUTB thus generated allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 in the next row the n 1 row to start an operation and the shift register circuit SRn in the previous row the n 1 th row to carry out a reset operation.

It should be noted here that the internal signal QBn which is generated inside of the shift register circuit SRn becomes active in a period of time 2H from a point in time where the set signal SB has become active to a point in time where the reset signal RB becomes active. Moreover an inversion signal Qn of the internal signal QBn is inputted to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn in the current row nth row signal CSRn of .

The following explains operation of each latch circuit CSL. The latch circuit CSL in each row is identical in configuration to that shown in . The following explanation refers to the latch circuit CSL as the D latch circuit CSL. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the D latch circuit CSLn. shows as an example a timing chart in the D latch circuit CSL in the first row and the D latch circuit CSL in the second row. It should be noted here that for the sake of convenience the internal signal QB shown in is expressed as internal signal Q logical inversion of QB .

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives a reset signal RESET via its terminal CL see . By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK see an internal signal Q signal CSR outputted from the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D see at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level during the period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. After that when the polarity signal CMI change from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low via its clock terminal CK t the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q in the second frame from low to high t .

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CS receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal Q signal CSR outputted from the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal Q changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the first row. It should be noted that the output in the third frame takes a waveform obtained by reversing the potential level of the output waveform in the second frame and in the fourth frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the second and third frames are alternately outputted.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL see . By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit CS outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal Q signal CSR outputted from the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level t to t . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level during the period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q in the second frame.

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal Q signal CSR outputted from the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal Q changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal Q is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal Q from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal Q in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the second row. It should be noted that in the third frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the first and second frames are alternately outputted.

Moreover the operations in the first and second rows correspond to operations of the D latch circuits in each odd numbered row and each even numbered row.

Thus the D latch circuits CSL CSL CSL . . . which correspond to their respective rows output CS signals so that in all the frames that include the first frame the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals in their corresponding rows fall at points in time where the TFTs are switched from on to off differ from one row to an adjacent row. This brings about the same effects as those brought about by Embodiment 1.

As in Embodiment 1 the configuration of Embodiment 2 causes a signal internal signal Q generated inside of the shift register circuit SRn to be inputted directly to the D latch circuit CSLn of the same row the nth row whereby a proper CS signal CSn is generated which allows eliminating the appearance of such transverse stripes. This allows a reduction in circuit area as compared with the conventional configuration thus allowing achieving a small sized liquid crystal display device and a liquid crystal display panel with a narrow frame both with high display quality.

Another embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . As in Embodiment 2 those members which have the same functions as those described above in Embodiment 1 are given the same reference numerals and are not described below. Further those terms defined in Embodiment 1 are defined in the same way in the present embodiment unless otherwise noted.

In Embodiment 3 too as shown in during an initial state as in the case shown in the CS signals CS CS and CS are all fixed at one potential in at a low level . The CS signal CS in the first row and the CS signal CS in the third row switch from a low level to a high level after rising edges in their corresponding gate signals G and G respectively and are at a high level at points in time where the gate signals G and G fall. Therefore the potential of a CS signal in each row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls is different from the potential of a CS signal in an adjacent row at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal falls. For example the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a low level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls and the CS signal CS is at a high level at a point in time where its corresponding gate signal G falls.

Thus as in Embodiment 1 adjacent rows are different from each other in terms of the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals fall in the first frame the CS signals CS CS and CS in the first frame takes the same waveforms as in a normal odd numbered frame e.g. the third frame . Therefore since the potentials Vpix Vpix and Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS CS and CS respectively inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative potential differences between the potential of the counter electrode and the shifted potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. This results in elimination of appearance of transverse stripes in the first frame thus allowing an improvement in display quality.

A specific configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit for achieving the aforementioned control is described here. shows a configuration of the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit . As in the row line next row following the nth row in a scanning direction indicated by an arrow in is represented as the n 1 th row and the row previous row immediately preceding the nth row in the scanning direction is represented as the n 1 th row.

As shown in the gate line driving circuit has a plurality of shift register circuits SR corresponding to their respective rows and the CS bus line driving circuit has a plurality of latch circuits CSL corresponding to their respective rows. The shift register circuits SR and the latch circuits CSL are all constituted as D latch circuits. In the following the shift register circuits SRn 1 SRn and SRn 1 and the latch circuits CSLn 1 CSLn and CSLn 1 which correspond to the n 1 th nth and n 1 th rows respectively are taken as an example.

The shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th row receives the gate clock signals GCK and GCK via its clock terminals CK and CKB respectively from the control circuit see and receives a shift register output SRBOn 2 from the previous row the n 2 th row via its set terminal S as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal OUTB connected to the set terminal S of the shift register circuit SRn of the next row the nth row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to output a shift register output SRBOn 1 via its output terminal OUT as a set signal to the shift register circuit SRn. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal OUT connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn 1 of the current row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to input a signal SRBOn 1 to the latch circuit CSLn 1.

Further the shift register output SRBOn 2 from the previous row the n 2 th row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn 1 and inputted to one input terminal of a NAND circuit of the current row the n 1 th row . GCK is inputted to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit and the output from the NAND circuit is outputted as a gate signal Gn 1 to the gate line of the current row the n 1 th row via a buffer.

The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal OUT connected to the set terminal S of the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn to output a shift register output SRBOn via its output terminal OUT as a set signal to the shift register circuit SRn 1. The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal OUT connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn to input an output signal SRBOn to the latch circuit CSLn.

Further the shift register output SRBOn 1 from the previous row the n 1 th row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn and inputted to one input terminal of a NAND circuit of the current row the nth row . GCK is inputted to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit and the output from the NAND circuit is outputted as a gate signal Gn to the gate line of the current row the nth row via a buffer.

The latch circuit CSLn in the nth row receives the polarity signal CMI from the control circuit see and the output signal SRBOn from the shift register circuit SRn. The latch circuit CSLn has its output terminal OUT connected to the CS bus line of the current row the nth row . This allows the latch circuit CSLn to output a CS signal CSOUTn via its output terminal OUT to the CS bus line of the current row.

The shift register circuit SRn 1 in the n 1 th row receives the gate clock signals GCK and GCK via its clock terminals CK and CKB respectively from the control circuit see and receives a shift register output SRBOn from the previous row the nth row via its set terminal S as a set signal for the shift register circuit SRn 1. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal out connected to the set terminal S of the shift register circuit SRn 2 of the next row the n 2 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to output a shift register output SRBOn 1 via its output terminal out as a set signal to the shift register circuit SRn 2. The shift register circuit SRn 1 has its output terminal out connected to the clock terminal CK of the latch circuit CSLn 1 of the current row the n 1 th row . This allows the shift register circuit SRn 1 to input a signal SRBOn 1 to the latch circuit CSLn 1.

Further the shift register output SRBOn from the previous row the nth row is both inputted to the shift register circuit SRn 1 and inputted to one input terminal of a NAND circuit of the current row the n 1 th row . GCK is inputted to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit and the output from the NAND circuit is outputted as a gate signal Gn 1 to the gate line of the current row the n 1 th row via a buffer.

The latch circuit CSLn 1 has its output terminal OUT connected to the CS bus line of the current row the n 1 th row . This allows the latch circuit CSLn 1 to output a CS signal CSOUTn 1 via its output terminal OUT to the CS bus line of the current row.

The following explains operation of each shift register circuit SR. shows the shift register circuits SRn in the nth row in detail. It should be noted that the shift register circuit SR in each row is identical in configuration to the shift register circuits SRn.

As shown in the shift register circuit SRn constituted by two inverters and and two clocked inverters and functions as a D latch circuit. As described above the shift register circuit SRn receives the shift register output SRBOn 1 via its set terminal S from the previous row the n 1 th row as a set signal receives a clock signal CK GCK via its clocked inverter and receives a clock signal CKB GCK via its clocked inverter . The shift register circuit SRn has its output terminal OUT connected to the clock terminal CK see of the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row and to the set terminal S of the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row .

Operation of the shift register circuit SRn is described below. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the shift register circuit SRn. First the set signal S output signal SRBOn 1 is inputted to the shift register circuit SRn. It should be noted here that while the clock signal CK is at a high level t to t the clocked inverter is in an on state whereby the input signal S at a low level is outputted as an output signal OUT output signal SRBOn . After the input signal S has changed from a low level to a high level active t to t the clock signal CK is dropped to a low level and the clock signal CKB is raised to a high level therefore the clocked inverter is brought into an off state and the clocked inverter is brought into an on state. This allows the shift register circuit SRn to retain a low level and the output signal OUT to be maintained at a low level.

After half a clock has elapsed since t t the clock signal CK changes from a low level to a high level and the clock signal CKB changes from a high level to a low level. Then the clocked inverter comes into an off state and the clocked inverter comes into an on state. This allows the input signal S to be outputted and the output signal OUT to change from a low level to a high level. Then when the clock signal CK changes from a high level to a low level and the clock signal CKB changes from a low level to a high level t the clocked inverter comes into an off state and the clocked inverter comes into an on state. This allows the shift register circuit SRn to retain a high level and the output signal OUT to maintain at a high level. In a period t to t during which the clock signal CKB is at a high level the output signal OUT maintains a high level. Next when the clock signal CKB changes from a high level to a low level and the clock signal CK changes from a low level to a high level t the clocked inverter comes into an on state and the clocked inverter comes into an off state. This allows the input signal S to be outputted and the output signal OUT to change from a high level to a low level.

The output signal OUT output signal SRBOn thus generated lags the input signal S output signal SRBOn 1 by half a clock 1H . This output signal OUT output signal SRBOn is a 2H width signal obtained by combining the clock signals CK and CKB together. Moreover the output signal OUT control signal is both inputted to the latch circuit CSLn of the current row the nth row and inputted as the input signal S to the shift register circuit SRn 1 of the next row the n 1 th row . Each shift register circuit SR carries out a shift operation in sequence on the basis of a signal OUT output signal SRBO outputted in each row.

The following explains operation of each latch circuit CSL. The latch circuit CSL in each row is identical in configuration to that shown in . The following explanation refers to the latch circuit CSL as the D latch circuit CSL. is a timing chart showing waveforms of various signals that are inputted to and outputted from the latch circuit CSLn. shows as an example a timing chart in the D latch circuit CSL in the first row and the D latch circuit CSL in the second row.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives a reset signal RESET via its terminal CL see . By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK see an output signal SRBO outputted from the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D see at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from high to low t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level during the period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. After that when the polarity signal CMI change from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from high to low via its clock terminal CK t the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO in the second frame.

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an output signal SRBO outputted from the shift register circuit SR. When the output signal SRBO changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the first row. It should be noted that the output in the third frame takes a waveform obtained by reversing the potential level of the output waveform in the second frame and in the fourth frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the second and third frames are alternately outputted.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL. By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an output signal SRBO outputted from the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from low to high t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from low to high t that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level t to t . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level during the period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO in the second frame.

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an output signal SRBO outputted from the shift register circuit SR. When the output signal SRBO changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the output signal SRBO is at a high level t to t . Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. After that when the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level t the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the output signal SRBO from high to low t via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the output signal SRBO in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the second row. It should be noted that in the third frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the first and second frames are alternately outputted.

Moreover the operations in the first and second rows correspond to operations in each odd numbered row and each even numbered row.

Thus the D latch circuits CSL CSL CSL . . . which correspond to their respective rows output CS signals so that in all the frames that include the first frame the potentials of the CS signals at points in time where the gate signals in their corresponding rows fall at points in time where the TFTs are switched from on to off differ from one row to an adjacent row. This brings about the same effects as those brought about by Embodiment 1.

Further the configuration of Embodiment 3 causes an output signal SRBO from the shift register circuit SRn to be inputted directly to the D latch circuit CSLn of the same row the nth row whereby a proper CS signal CSn is generated which allows eliminating the appearance of such transverse stripes. As in Embodiment 1 this allows a reduction in circuit area as compared with the conventional configuration thus allowing achieving a small sized liquid crystal display device and a liquid crystal display panel with a narrow frame both with high display quality.

Another embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to . It should be noted that those members which have the same functions as those described above in Embodiment 1 are given the same reference numerals and are not described below. Further those terms defined in Embodiment 1 are defined in the same way in the present embodiment unless otherwise noted.

Further shows the following signals in the order named a source signal S video signal which is supplied from the source bus line driving circuit to a source bus line source bus line provided in the xth column a gate signal G which is supplied from the gate line driving circuit to a gate line provided in the first row a CS signal CS which is supplied from the CS bus line driving circuit to a CS bus line provided in the first row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the first row and the xth column. shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the second row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the second row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the second row and the xth column. shows the following signals in the order named a gate signal G which is supplied to a gate line provided in the third row a CS signal CS which is supplied to a CS bus line provided in the third row and a potential waveform Vpix of a pixel electrode provided in the third row and the xth column. As to the fourth and fifth rows similarly shows a gate signal G a CS signal CS and a potential waveform Vpix in the order named and a gate signal G a CS signal CS and a potential waveform Vpix in the order named.

It should be noted that the dotted lines in the potentials Vpix Vpix Vpix Vpix and Vpix indicate the potential of the counter electrode .

In the following it is assumed that the start frame of a display picture is a first frame and that the first frame is preceded by an initial state. As shown in during an initial state the CS signals CS to CS are all fixed at one potential in at a low level . In the first frame the CS signal CS in the first row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G which corresponds to the output SRBO from the corresponding shift register circuit SR falls. The CS signal CS in the second row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the third row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fourth row is at a low level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls. The CS signal CS in the fifth row is at a high level at a point in time where the corresponding gate signals G falls.

It should be noted that the source signal S is a signal which has amplitude corresponding to a gray scale represented by a video signal and which reverses its polarity every two horizontal scanning period 2H . Further since it is assumed in that a uniform picture is displayed the amplitude of the source signal S is constant. Meanwhile the gate signals G to G serve as gate on potentials during the first to fifth 1H periods respectively in an active period effective scanning period of each frame and serve as gate off potentials during the other periods.

Then the CS signals CS to CS switch between high and low potential levels after their corresponding gate signals G to G fall. Specifically in the first frame the CS signals CS and CS fall after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS rises after its corresponding signals G and G falls respectively. It should be noted that in the second frame this relationship is reversed i.e. the CS signals CS and CS rise after their corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively and the CS signals CS and CS falls after its corresponding gate signals G and G fall respectively.

Thus in the 2H inversion driven liquid crystal display device the potential of each CS signal at a point in time where the gate signal falls varies every two rows in correspondence with the polarity of the source signal S therefore in the first frame the potentials Vpix to Vpix of the pixel electrodes are all properly shifted by the CS signals CS to CS respectively. Therefore inputting of source signals S of the same gray scale causes the positive and negative potential differences between the potential of the counter electrode and the shifted potential of each of the pixel electrodes to be equal to each other. That is in the first frame in which a source signal of a negative polarity is written into pixels corresponding to two adjacent rows in the same column of pixels and a source signal of a positive polarity is written into pixels corresponding to two adjacent pixels next to the two rows in the same column of pixels the potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the first two rows are not polarity reversed during the writing into the pixels corresponding to the first two rows are polarity reversed in a negative direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing and the potentials of the CS signals corresponding to the next two rows are not polarity reversed during the writing into the pixels corresponding to the next two rows are polarity reversed in a positive direction after the writing and are not polarity reversed until the next writing. This results in elimination of appearance of transverse stripes every two rows in the first frame thus allowing an improvement in display quality.

Operation of each shift register circuit SR is identical to the operation shown in and as such is not described here.

The following explains operation of each latch circuit CSL with reference to . shows as an example waveforms that are inputted to and outputted from the D latch circuits CL to CL in the first to fifth rows. First changes in waveform of various signals in the first row are described. The D latch circuit CSL shown below is identical in configuration to that shown in .

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives a reset signal RESET via its terminal CL. By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G which corresponds to an output SRO from the shift register circuit SR to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. Upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from low to high the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a high level and outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI until the next time when there is a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low that the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK i.e. during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level . When the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level during the period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the second frame from low to high .

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal M changes from a low level to a high level the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level. Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a high level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the first row. It should be noted that the output in the third frame takes a waveform obtained by reversing the potential level of the output waveform in the second frame and in the fourth frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the second and third frames are alternately outputted.

In the initial state the D latch circuit CSL receives the reset signal RESET via its terminal CL. By this reset signal RESET the potential of the CS signal CS that the D latch circuit CSL outputs via its output terminal OUT is retained at a low level.

When in the first frame the gate line driving circuit supplies a gate signal G which corresponds to an output SRO from the shift register circuit SR to the gate line in the first row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR.

When the polarity signal CMI changes from a high level to a low level during the period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a high level to a low level. Next upon receiving a change in potential of the internal signal M from high to low via its clock terminal CK the D latch circuit CSL latches an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received at the point in time i.e. latches a low level. After that the D latch circuit CSL retains its output CS at a low level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the second frame from low to high .

When in the second frame the gate line driving circuit similarly supplies a gate signal G to the gate line in the second row the D latch circuit CSL receives via its clock terminal CK an internal signal M signal CSR generated by the shift register circuit SR. When the internal signal M changes from a low level to a high level the D latch circuit CSL transfers an input state of the polarity signal CMI that it received via its input terminal D at the point in time i.e. transfers a low level. The D latch circuit CSL outputs the change in potential of the polarity signal CMI during a period of time in which the internal signal M is at a high level. Therefore when the polarity signal CMI changes from a low level to a high level the D latch circuit CSL switches its output CS from a low level to a high level.

After that the D latch circuit CSL retains a high level until there is a change in potential of the internal signal M in the third frame.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the second row. It should be noted that the output in the third frame takes a waveform obtained by reversing the potential level of the output waveform in the second frame and in the fourth frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the second and third frames are alternately outputted.

The CS signal CS thus generated is supplied to the CS bus line of the third row. It should be noted that in the third frame and later signals identical in output waveform to those in the first and second frames are alternately outputted.

Thus in Embodiment 4 the latch circuits . . . which correspond to their respective rows receive the polarity signals CMI and CMI which each reverses its polarity every two horizontal scanning periods and which are different in phase from each other. This brings about an effect of improving display quality in 2H inversion driving by preventing the generation of transverse stripes in the first frame. Further as in the case of the 1H inversion driven liquid crystal display device the effect is brought about without causing an increase in circuit area as compared with a conventional liquid crystal display device.

The liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment is not limited to 1H inversion driving or 2H inversion driving and may also be applied to nH inversion driving.

It should be noted here that although Embodiments 1 to 4 is each configured such that the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit are integrally formed and provided on one side of the liquid crystal display panel this does not imply any limitation. The gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit may be provided separately. For example such a configuration is possible that the gate line driving circuit is provided on one side of the liquid crystal display panel and the CS bus line driving circuit on the other side.

Further although the gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit shown in each of Embodiments 1 to 4 are configured to have one scanning direction e.g. the direction of the arrow in this does not imply any limitation. The gate line driving circuit and the CS bus line driving circuit may be configured to have an opposite scanning direction or to have a function of switching from one scanning direction to another.

The retaining circuit CSL at each stage of the CS bus line driving circuit according to the present embodiment may be configured as shown in . As shown in the retaining circuit CSL includes a memory circuit and an analog switching circuit . The memory circuit includes transistors and as switching elements and capacitors and and the analog switching circuit includes transistors and . Each of the transistors are constituted by an N channel MOS transistor and the retaining circuit CSL is constituted as a single channel N channel driving circuit. It should be noted that each of the transistors may be constituted by a P channel MOS transistor and the retaining circuit CSL may be constituted as a P channel driving circuit.

As shown in the retaining circuit CSL receives the internal signal Mn from the shift register circuit SRn in the nth row and the polarity signals CMI and CMIB and outputs the CS signal CSOUTn via the memory circuit and the analog switching circuit .

Operation of the retaining circuit CSL up to the point of output of the CS signal CSOUTn is described here with reference to . It should be noted that the following describes an operation that the retaining circuit CSL carries out in outputting a CS signal that is positive in polarity i.e. on receiving CMI that is positive in polarity.

First when the memory circuit receives the internal signal Mn the memory circuit loads the polarity signal CMI in accordance with a change in polarity of the internal signal Mn. Specifically when the internal signal Mn changes in potential from a low level to a high level the memory circuit transfers the polarity signal CMI and outputs it as a signal LAn and the capacitor collects stores charge. That is as shown in the signal LAn switches from a H level to a L level since the polarity signal CMI is outputted during a period of time in which the internal signal Mn is at a H level in which the transistor is on . Next when the internal signal Mn changes in potential level from a H level to a L level the transistor is shut off so that the polarity signal CMI is no longer outputted. Then the capacitor which has collected charge allows the signal LAn to retain a potential level L level reached at the point in time where the transistor was turned off. The signal LAn retains this state L level until the next time when the internal signal Mn changes in potential level from a L level to a H level i.e. during a single vertical scanning period 1V .

Next after 1V has elapsed the internal signal Mn changes in potential level from a L level to a H level. Then the polarity signal CMI is transferred and outputted therefore the signal LAn switches from a L level to a H level and retains this state high level during a single vertical scanning period 1V . After that the aforementioned process is repeated.

The signal LAn outputted from the memory circuit as a result of the aforementioned operation is inputted to the transistor of the analog switching circuit . The analog switching circuit receives a common voltage VCSH that is positive in polarity and a common voltage VCSL that is negative in polarity and the turning on and off of the transistor is controlled by the signal LAn. This allows the transistor to be turned on at the timing H level of a rising edge in the signal LAn so that VCSH is outputted as the CS signal CSOUTn while the signal LAn is at a H level.

It should be noted here that because the polarity signals CMI and CMIB is opposite in polarity to each other at the timing when the transistors and are turned on the signals LAn and LABn that are outputted from the memory circuit are different in potential level H L level from each other. Therefore as shown in when one of the signals is at a H level the other signal is outputted at a L level. This allows outputting a CS signal that reverses its potential level every frame.

It should be noted that a display driving circuit of the present invention may be configured as follows 

The display driving circuit is used in a display device in which pixels are arranged in rows and columns in which for each single row of pixels there are provided a scanning signal line and a retention capacitor wire that forms a capacitor with each pixel electrodes in the row of pixels and in which a potential reverses its polarity every single row of pixels. The display driving circuit includes a plurality of shift register circuits provided in such a way as to correspond to their respective rows. As for a scanning signal and a retention capacitor wire signal that switches in potential between high and low levels which signals are respectively supplied to a scanning signal line and a retention capacitor wire that correspond to one of two adjacent rows of pixels when the scanning signal changes from active to non active in the first vertical scanning period of a display picture the potential of the retention capacitor wire signal is at a low level and the retention capacitor wire signal switches in potential to a high level by the next time when the scanning signal becomes active. As for a scanning signal and a retention capacitor wire signal that switches in potential between high and low levels which signals are respectively supplied to a scanning signal line and a retention capacitor wire that correspond to the other one of the two adjacent rows of pixels when the scanning signal changes from active to non active in the first vertical scanning period of the display picture the potential of the retention capacitor wire signal is at a high level and the retention capacitor wire signal switches in potential to a low level by the next time when the scanning signal becomes active. The retention capacitor wire signals are generated by a retention capacitor wire driving circuit and the retention capacitor wire driving circuit includes a plurality of shift register circuits provided in such a way as to correspond to their respective rows. An internal signal from the shift register circuit in each row or an output signal from the shift register circuit in each row is inputted to the latch circuit in that row.

Further in the display driving circuit each one stage of the shift register corresponds to a scanning signal line and a retention capacitor wire that are provided in a single row of pixel and a scanning signal and a retention capacitor wire signal that are respectively supplied to the scanning signal line and the retention capacitor wire are generated using an internal signal or an output signal of that stage.

It should be noted that the gate line driving circuit the source line driving circuit or the gate line CS bus line driving circuit and the pixel circuit of the display section may be formed monolithically on an identical substrate .

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that a signal potential that is supplied to a data signal line reverses its polarity every n horizontal scanning periods where n is an integer and a direction of change of signal potentials written into pixel electrodes from the data signal line varies every n adjacent rows.

This allows elimination of the appearance of transverse stripes every n rows in n line inversion driving.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that when a scanning signal that is supplied to a scanning signal line connected pixels corresponding to a current stage has changed from active to non active a potential of a retention capacitor wire signal that is supplied to a retention capacitor wire forming capacitors with pixel electrodes of the pixels varies every n adjacent rows.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that immediately after a scanning signal that is supplied to a scanning signal line connected pixels corresponding to a current stage has changed from active to non active and while the control signal generated by a next stage of the shift register is active the retention target signal that is inputted to a retaining circuit corresponding to the next stage changes in potential.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that the retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage includes a first input section via which the retaining circuit receives the control signal generated by the current stage of the shift register a second input section via which the retaining circuit receives the retention target signal and an output section via which the retaining circuit outputs the retention capacitor wire signal to a retention capacitor wire corresponding to the previous stage the retaining circuit outputs as a first potential of the retention capacitor wire signal a first potential of the retention target signal that the retaining circuit received via the second input section when the control signal that the retaining circuit received via the first input section became active during a period of time in which the control signal that the retaining circuit received via the first input section is active the retention capacitor wire signal changes in potential in accordance with a change in potential of the retention target signal that the retaining circuit received via the second input section and the retaining circuit outputs as a second potential of the retention capacitor wire signal a second potential of the retention target signal that the retaining circuit received via the second input section when the control signal that the retaining circuit received via the first input section became non active.

This brings about an effect of improving display quality with simple circuitry by preventing the appearance of transverse stripes in the first vertical scanning period.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that a control signal that is generated by a current stage of the shift register is generated in accordance with an output signal from a previous stage of the shift register by which output signal the current stage of the shift register is set and an output signal from the current stage of the shift register by which output signal the current stage of the shift register is reset.

This allows achieving a self resetting shift register thus further allowing a further simplification of circuitry.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that a control signal that is generated by a current stage of the shift register is generated in accordance with an output signal from a previous stage of the shift register by which output signal the current stage of the shift register is set and an output signal from a subsequent stage of the shift register by which output signal the current stage of the shift register is reset.

The foregoing configuration brings about an effect of improving display quality with a conventional common shift register by preventing the appearance of such transverse stripes.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that an output signal from the current stage of the shift register is inputted to the subsequent stage of the shift register and the previous stage of the shift register and the control signal generated by the current stage of the shift register is inputted to the retaining circuit corresponding to the current stage.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that a control signal generated by a current stage of the shift register is active during a period from a point in time where an output signal from a previous stage of the shift register by which output signal operation of the current stage of the shift register is started is inputted to the current stage of the shift register to a point in time where a reset signal by which the operation of the current stage of the shift register is terminated is inputted to the current stage of the shift register.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that an output signal from the current stage of the shift register is generated in accordance with an output signal from the previous stage of the shift register by which output signal the current stage of the shift register is set and a clock signal inputted from an outside source.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that the control signal generated by the current stage of the shift register is an output signal from the current stage of the shift register and the output signal from the current stage of the shift register is inputted to a subsequent stage of the shift register and the retaining circuit of the current stage.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that the output signal from the current stage of the shift register lags by half a clock an output signal from a previous stage of the shift register by which output signal operation of the current stage of the shift register is started.

The foregoing configuration allows the scanning signal driving circuit to be constituted by latch circuits. This brings about an effect of improving display quality with simple circuitry by preventing the appearance of transverse stripes in the first vertical scanning period.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that a retention target signal that is inputted to a plurality of retaining circuits and a retention target signal that is inputted to another plurality of retaining circuits are different in phase from each other.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that one of two retaining circuits that carry out a retention operation in an identical horizontal scanning period is supplied with a first retention target signal and the other retaining circuit is supplied with a second retention target signal that is different in phase from the first retention target signal.

The foregoing configuration allows retention capacitor wire signals to vary in potential every n rows thus allowing elimination of transverse stripes every n rows.

The display driving circuit may also be configured such that each of the retaining circuits is constituted as a D latch circuit or a memory circuit.

A display device according to the present invention includes any one of the display driving circuits and a display panel.

With the foregoing configuration the effect of the display driving circuit preventing the appearance of transverse stripes makes it possible to provide a display device with satisfactory display quality.

It should be noted that it is preferable that the display device according to the present invention be a liquid crystal display device.

The present invention is not limited to the embodiments above but a modification of any one of the embodiments on the basis of technical common sense or a combination of such modification such as a COM driving circuit is encompassed in the embodiments of the present invention.

The present invention can be suitably applied in particular to driving of an active matrix liquid crystal display device.
