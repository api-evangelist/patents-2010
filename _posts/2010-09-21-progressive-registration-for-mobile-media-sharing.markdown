title: Progressive registration for mobile media sharing
abstract: A media sharing system accommodates passively registered users, who receive information from the system but do not provide content media to the system, and actively registered users, who provide content to the system and then share it with others. The system collects and stores information about a user as the information is needed to accomplish a function, shielding the user from burdensome data entry.
