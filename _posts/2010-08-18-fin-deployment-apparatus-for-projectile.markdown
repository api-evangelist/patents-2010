title: Fin deployment apparatus for projectile
abstract: A projectile may include a body and a base fixed to a rear end of the body. The base may include a gas cavity and an opening extending from a rear end of the base to the gas cavity. A retention plug may be disposed in the opening wherein a fit between the retention plug and the opening is such that propellant gas pressure in the gas cavity forces the retention plug out of the opening.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to tube launched or gun launched projectiles.

Some gun launched projectiles may include guidance systems. Guidance systems may include components such as for example control motors and electronics. The guidance system components may require that the projectile spin at a low spin rate. The low spin rate may decrease the stability of the projectile. Fins may be used to increase the stability of the projectile. While a projectile is in a gun tube the projectile s fins may be damaged by uneven loads produced by propellant gases. A need exists for a method and apparatus for protecting fins while in a gun tube and then deploying the fins after the projectile exits the gun tube.

It is an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for protecting fins while in a gun tube and then deploying the fins after the projectile exits the gun tube.

One aspect of the invention is a projectile. The projectile may include a body and a base fixed to a rear end of the body. The base may include a gas cavity and an opening extending from a rear end of the base to the gas cavity. A retention plug may be disposed in the opening. A fit between the retention plug and the opening may be such that propellant gas pressure in the gas cavity forces the retention plug out of the opening.

The retention plug may include at least one gas conduit between an outer surface of the retention plug and the gas cavity. A plurality of fins may be rotatably fixed to the base. The fins having a folded position and a deployed position.

A retention screw may be adjustably disposed in a rear end of the retention plug. A tab may be disposed on an inner edge of each fin. The retention screw may bear against the tabs to maintain the fins in the folded position. The retention plug may include a plurality of slots formed therein. When the fins are in the folded position a portion of each fin may be disposed in a respective one of the slots.

The base may include a slot and a fin shaft opening for each fin. A fin shaft may be connected to each fin. Each fin shaft may be rotatably disposed in the fin shaft opening in the base. A spring loaded pin may be disposed in each fin shaft. The spring loaded pin may lock the fin in the deployed position.

Another aspect of the invention is a method. The method may include providing a projectile as described above. The projectile may be seated in a cartridge having propellant. The method may include igniting the propellant and filling the gas cavity of the base of the projectile with gas produced by combustion of the propellant. When the projectile exits a gun tube the method may include forcing the retention plug out of the base and moving the fins from the folded position to the deployed position.

After moving the fins to the deployed position the method may include locking the fins in the deployed position.

A further aspect of the invention is a fin deployment apparatus. The fin deployment apparatus may include a base having a gas cavity and an opening extending from a rear end of the base to the gas cavity. A retention plug may be disposed in the opening. A fit between the retention plug and the opening may be such that propellant gas pressure in the gas cavity forces the retention plug out of the opening.

The retention plug may include at least one gas conduit between an outer surface of the retention plug and the gas cavity. A plurality of fins may be rotatably fixed to the base. The fins may have a folded position and a deployed position.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A fin deployment apparatus may support the rear fins of a projectile. A fin deployment apparatus may maintain the rear fins in a stowed configuration until the entire projectile has exited the gun tube muzzle. After exiting the muzzle a fin deployment apparatus may function by using the differential pressure between a pressurized gas cavity of the fin deployment apparatus and the atmosphere surrounding the fin deployment apparatus. The differential pressure may push a plug out of and away from a base thereby releasing and deploying the stabilizing fins. The plug may have an aerodynamic shape to ensure that it does not return to the gun site and inflict damage to the crew or equipment.

Once released the fins may then mechanically lock at a desired angle from the base. It may be necessary for the fins to be released simultaneously due to the naturally low level of stability in some precision artillery. The low stability may be required to ensure adequate maneuverability of the projectile throughout its flight and in its terminal flight phase.

A fit between retention plug and opening may be such that propellant gas pressure in gas cavity forces retention plug out of opening . For example the fit between plug and opening may be a press type of fit with an overlap of for example about 0.001 inches. Retention plug may include at least one gas conduit see also between an outer surface of retention plug and gas cavity . In one embodiment there may be four gas conduits spaced about ninety degrees apart.

After ignition of propellant the high pressure propellant gases may fill gas cavity via conduits before projectile exits gun tube . The pressure of the propellant gases in tube may be for example about 20 000 psi. When projectile exits tube the high pressure gas in cavity may force plug out of opening . Movement of plug rearwardly causes fins to rotate open as will be explained in more detail.

A plurality of fins may be rotatably fixed to base . Fins may comprise for example steel. Fins may have a folded position as in and a deployed position as in . Each fin may include a tab disposed on an inner edge of the fin . Each fin may include an opening for receiving a fin shaft .

Fins may be maintained in the folded position with a retention screw that may interact with tabs . Retention screw may be adjustably disposed in a rear end of retention plug . For example retention screw may be threaded into rear end of plug . Retention screw may include a head .

In the position shown in tabs may be disposed beneath forward of head . Retention screw may be threaded inwardly to bear against tabs and thereby maintain fins in the folded position. A gap may exist between forward edges of tabs and rear end of plug . The gap allows the fins to be unlocked as plug and retention screw move rearward after projectile exits gun tube .

Retention plug may include a plurality of slots formed therein. When fins are in the folded position a portion of each fin may be disposed in a respective one of the slots . A forward edge of each slot may be curvilinear. A forward edge of each fin may be linear. Alternatively a forward edge of each fin ma be curved.

Base may include a slot and a fin shaft opening for each fin . Fin deployment apparatus may further include a fin shaft FIGS. and A B connected to each fin . Fin shafts may be rotatably disposed in fin shaft openings in base . Each fin shaft may include an opening for housing a spring loaded pin .

After projectile exits the gun muzzle plug with attached retention screw may move rearward. Fins may first be unlocked by movement of retention screw away from tabs . As plug moves further rearward fins may rotate outwardly around fin shafts . When fins have completed their outward rotation deployed position of spring loaded pins may extend outwardly into recesses formed adjacent fin shaft openings in base . Extension of the spring loaded pins into recesses may lock fins in the deployed position.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
