This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from commonly owned U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 228 814 filed Jul. 27 2009 entitled LIQUID METAL CLAMP AND FIBER CLEAVING USING SAME which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present inventive concepts relate to the field of fiber optics and more particularly to the field of system and methods for preparing and processing optical fibers.

In conventional fiber cleavers a first portion of a fiber is mechanically clamped by a first clamp and then a second portion of the fiber is mechanically clamped by a second clamp. Once both clamps are secured to the fiber one clamp is selectively moved away or translated from the other clamp until a proper amount of tension is applied to the fiber between the clamps.

Once the proper amount of tension is applied a surface of the fiber is scored with for example an ultrasonic diamond blade. Given the tension the scoring of the fiber surface causes a crack to propagate through the fiber achieving a cleave of the fiber.

The stripped portion of the fiber is held by two clamps and . A first portion of fiber is positioned in a bottom portion of clamp and then a top portion of clamp is closed to secure the first portion of fiber . Fiber is clamped in clamp the same way. That is a second portion of fiber is positioned in a bottom portion of clamp and then a top portion of clamp is closed to secure the second portion of fiber . Clamp can be translated away from clamp to apply a controlled and accurate amount of tension to the fiber between the clamps .

Presuming the fiber is tensioned between the two clamps and the stripped portion of the fiber between the clamps can be cleaved. A slider includes a hard sharp blade e.g. an ultrasonic vibrating diamond blade that gets placed in contact the with the fiber when the slider is moved in the direction of the fiber within tracks . The blade scores a surface of the fiber and the tension applied to the fiber causes a crack originating at the score to propagate through the fiber resulting in a cleave.

In an ideal situation the cleave is perfectly perpendicular to a central axis and surface of the fiber. However the ideal is not practically achievable largely because clamping with the second clamp causes a small yet important torsion to the fiber. The torsion causes the propagation of the crack to be slightly off perpendicular.

When the ends of two fibers being spliced together are not perfectly perpendicular with respect to their surfaces the imperfect junction of the fibers adversely impacts the transmission properties of the spliced fiber.

The problem of torsion from the second clamp exists with fibers having a circular cross section. This problem is further exacerbated with fibers having other than circular cross sections and multi strand or bundled fibers.

In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure provided is a clamp system. The system includes a first clamp configured to hold a first portion of a set of fibers and a second clamp configured to hold a second portion of the set of fibers. The second clamp includes a liquid metal that takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of the second portion of the set of fibers and that takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the second portion of the set of fibers.

The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.

The system can further comprise a temperature controller arranged to transition the liquid metal to the first temperature.

The temperature controller can be further arranged to transition the liquid metal to the second temperature.

The metal alloy can consist of a Bi In Sn fusible alloy wherein the state change temperature can be about 174 F.

The multiple fibers can comprise a center fiber and a plurality of fibers distributed about the center fiber.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention provided is a method of clamping a set of fibers. The method comprises clamping a first portion of the set of fibers with a first clamp and clamping a second portion of the set of fibers with a second clamp that is a liquid metal clamp. Clamping the second portion of the set of fibers with a second clamp includes providing a liquid metal in a liquid form at a first temperature positioning the second portion of the set of fibers in the liquid metal in the liquid form and transitioning the liquid metal to a second temperature so that the liquid metal takes a solid form thereby securing the second portion of the set of fibers.

The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention provided is a fiber clamp comprising a liquid metal disposed in a container wherein the liquid metal takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of a portion of a set of fibers and takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the portion of the set of fibers.

The clamp can further comprise a temperature controller arranged to transition the liquid metal to the first temperature.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention provided is a fiber cleaver. The cleaver includes a first clamp configured to hold a first portion of a set of fibers a second clamp configured to hold a second portion of the set of fibers. and a blade configured to score the at least one fiber to generate a cleave in the at least one fiber. The second clamp includes a liquid metal that takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of the second portion of the set of fibers and that takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the second portion of the set of fibers.

The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.

The clamped set of fibers is maintained with an amount of torsion such that the cleave can be off from perpendicular relative to a surface of the fiber by 0.2 degrees or less.

The system can further include a heat pump arranged to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature.

The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature in response to a first voltage.

The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the second temperature in response to a second voltage.

The tensioning can be controlled by a controller and the tension can be a predetermined amount of tension for the set of fibers.

Hereinafter aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments detailed descriptions of well known items functions or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. are be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Spatially relative terms such as beneath below lower above upper and the like may be used to describe an element and or feature s relationship to another element s and or feature s as for example illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example if the device in the figures is turned over elements described as below and or beneath other elements or features would then be oriented above the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented e.g. rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.

In the various embodiments the fiber can be a single fiber of small or large diameter e.g. diameters above 40 m. The fiber can have a circular cross section or a non circular cross section e.g. oval . The fiber can be a plurality of fibers e.g. a ribbon or bundle of fibers. The plurality of fibers can for example include a center fiber and a plurality of fibers distributed about the center fiber in parallel . The fiber or plurality of fibers can be collectively referred to as a set of fibers. The set of fibers can include any known fiber or plurality of fibers and those developed hereafter.

Unlike in the fiber or set of fibers and holding and cleaving elements are vertically oriented so that a second portion of the fiber can be positioned in the liquid metal clamp of this embodiment. Fiber is fiber without the casing or cladding e.g. stripped . Liquid metal clamp includes a bowl within which a liquid metal is maintained. In this embodiment the liquid metal can take a liquid form at a first temperature and take a solid form at a second temperature. The first temperature can be above a state change temperature and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.

A temperature controller can be included and arranged to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature that is above the state change temperature so that the liquid metal takes a liquid form. When the liquid metal is in the liquid form a second portion of the fiber is positioned in the liquid metal within bowl . The liquid metal is then brought to a second temperature above the state change temperature so that it takes a solid form.

The liquid metal can be allowed to cool to reach the second temperature or it can be cooled using a cooling mechanism e.g. using temperature controller or a cooling mechanism that generates a flow of cool air or a gas e.g. using a fan . If unassisted cooling is used the temperature controller can be used to bring the liquid metal just above the state change temperature e.g. by 10 degrees F. or less so that it transitions below the state change temperature more quickly. This approach could be used with assisted cooling as well. Ten degrees F. above state change temperature is not however a restriction for purposes of the present invention.

In the preferred form the liquid metal is a Bi In Sn fusible alloy Bi is Bismuth In is Indium and Sn is Tin. In this embodiment the Bi In Sn fusible alloy includes 57 Bi 26 In and 17 Sn which has a state change temperature of about 174 F. One advantage of this alloy is that it is free of hazardous materials making its handing use and disposal relatively uncomplicated by special hazardous material requirements and procedures.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many other alloys could be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example the liquid metal could be a Bi Sn solder alloy e.g. with 58 Bi and 42 Sn and a state change temperature of 138 F. As another example the liquid metal could be a Bi In Pb Sn fusible alloy e.g. with 59 Bi. 21 In 18 Pb Lead and 12 Sn and a state change temperature of 136 F. As another example the liquid metal could be a Bi Pb Sn alloy e.g. with 52.5 Bi 32.0 Pb and 15.5 Sn. At the end of this specification are Addendum datasheets providing examples of metal alloys that can be used for the liquid metal clamping in accordance with the present invention.

The Bi In Sn fusible alloy properties presently seem to be the best with regard to the above criteria. But other criteria could lead to a different selection.

There is another class of materials which might be used as the liquid metal i.e. metals which are liquid at or near room temperature or even below . These include Gallium and many of its alloys. In this case it would not be necessary to heat the material to melt it only to cool it for solidification. Mercury also might be considered but is undesirable due to its very high toxicity. It is also possible that Mercury would not function well as a clamp as it is known to exhibit negligible wetting of glass unlike Gallium which wets glass aggressively or Indium which does so to a lesser degree.

In other embodiments the liquid metal could include non metals such as glues epoxies etc. Thus the term liquid metal as used herein can encompass non metals. In such cases if the non metal is initially in a liquid form the temperature controller could be used to produce either heating or cooling as required to bring the non metal to a solid form.

The temperature controller can be a Peltier heat pump as an example which is known in the art. The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature in response to a first voltage. The heat pump can also be configured to bring the liquid metal to the second temperature in response to a second voltage. The second voltage can have about the same magnitude as the first voltage with an opposite polarity. The first temperature can be about 40 F. higher than the second temperature in one embodiment.

For small diameter fibers e.g. less than 40 m in diameter a cleave that is two degrees or less off perpendicular is desirable. For large diameter fibers e.g. equal to or greater than 40 m in diameter a cleave that is half a degree or less off perpendicular is desirable. The clamp achieved by the liquid metal when achieving the solid state provides a fiber confirming substantially uniform force clamp substantially torsion free. As a result a cleave of a fiber clamped in this way will tend to have a negligible angle relative to a line that is perpendicular to a central axis or outer surface of the fiber e.g. an angle less than about 0.5 and preferably less than about 0.2 . These results can be achieved regardless of the outer shape of the fiber fiber strip or fiber bundle as the case may be.

In this embodiment of a clamp and cleaver after the cleave the liquid metal can be returned to liquid form the fiber portion or end can be removed from the bowl and discarded and the liquid metal then can be retained for use with another fiber to be cleaved.

Unlike in the fiber or set of fibers and holding and cleaving elements are horizontally oriented so that a second portion of the fiber can be positioned in the liquid metal clamp of this embodiment. Liquid metal clamp includes a trough within which a liquid metal is maintained. As with the embodiment of the liquid metal takes a liquid form at a first temperature and takes a solid form at a second temperature. The first temperature can be above a state change temperature and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.

Temperature controller can be included and arranged to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature so that the liquid metal takes a liquid form. When the liquid metal is in the liquid form a second portion or end of the fiber is positioned in the liquid metal within trough . The liquid metal is then brought to a second temperature so that it takes a solid form.

As above the clamp achieved by the liquid metal achieving the solid state which provides a fiber confirming substantially uniform force clamp substantially torsion free. As a result a cleave of a fiber clamped in this way will tend to have a negligible angle relative to a line that is perpendicular to a central axis or outer surface of the fiber e.g. an angle less than about 0.5 and preferably less than about 0.2 . These results can be achieved regardless of the outer shape of the fiber fiber strip or fiber bundle as the case may be.

In this embodiment of a clamp and cleaver after the cleave the liquid metal can be returned to liquid form the fiber end removed from the bowl and discarded and the liquid metal then retained for use with another fiber to be cleaved.

In some cases multiple liquid clamps could be used. For example in the above embodiments the first clamp could also be a liquid clamp.

Those skilled in the art will appreciated that the liquid clamp disclosed herein can have utility beyond that disclosed for fiber cleavers e.g. for stripping and or splicing. Depending on the use the liquid clamp could be the only clamp where a first clamp is not needed.

Also while the clamp is referred to as a liquid metal clamp herein reflecting the presently known best mode in other embodiments a liquid metal clamp could include substances materials or combinations that do not include metals per se but that serve as suitable equivalents. For example there may be several non metals that are liquid at a first temperature and solid at a second temperature that could suffice. Thus the phrase liquid metal is intended to include non metal equivalents.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
