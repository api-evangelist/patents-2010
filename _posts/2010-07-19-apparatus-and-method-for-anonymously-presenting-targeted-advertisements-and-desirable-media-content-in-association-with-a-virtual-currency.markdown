title: Apparatus and method for anonymously presenting targeted advertisements and desirable media content in association with a virtual currency
abstract: An electronic advertising system anonymously directs the attention of a user to content provided by an advertiser, in exchange for subsequently permitting the same user to access otherwise restricted desirable content of another part. Such desirable content may include online entertainment media, digital video content, social media, news media, and other privileged services or data. The user accumulates points, or virtual currency, in exchange for viewing the advertisements of vendor affiliates of the present system. The user may then spend previously accumulated points, or virtual currency, in order to access desirable content of redeemer affiliates of the present system. The present system further facilitates financial transactions between the system operator, vendor affiliates, and redeemer affiliates, relative to the movement of virtual currency amongst the various parties.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 271 207 filed Jul. 17 2009 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates in general to the presentation of electronic advertisements such as via the Internet and more particularly to the presentation of targeted advertisements in a manner that does not track an individual s Internet page navigation and history.

One issue facing the electronic advertising industry is the trade off between maximizing the amount of entertaining or desirable content that an individual exploring the Internet wants to see against the amount of advertising that is overlaid on top of or near such entertaining or desirable content.

Escalating the issue many online advertisers have implemented rather obtuse advertising systems that are often perceived as annoying to the end user including pop up ads and in text callout balloons. Unfortunately such systems necessarily force the participant s attention to be split between the advertisement and the non advertising content. This split is often less than desirable to all parties involved.

Many current consumers of digital media want to experience watch and or consume the content of their choice at the time of their choosing. Therefore many of these consumers do not particularly appreciate advertising methods that more or less randomly interrupt the experience of the participant. Thus a need exists for a technology that simultaneously satisfies the interests of advertisers in terms of their desires to broaden their exposure base and keep consumers informed of new products and services without overwhelming the end user and media viewer with unwanted potentially annoying unwelcome and unexpected advertising presentations.

A further drawback of many contemporary electronic advertising systems is that it is not uncommon for an individual or entity to be offended by advertising content that is presented side by side with primary non advertising content. Thus there is a need for advertising systems that give unprecedented levels of user control to the end media viewer or individual exploring the Internet.

Another drawback of many contemporary systems is that a significant number of contemporary digital advertising systems leverage some type of algorithmic data mining whereby the advertiser generates buys or records personal information such as web browser history shopping trends profile and social network picture viewing statistics age gender marital status family status sexual orientation religious persuasion computer software and hardware configurations indications of salary or generic financial success and numerous other examples of personal data. Many individuals express an extremely strong desire for such tracking technologies to become rare optional or even non existent.

Accordingly a digital advertising technology that is completely anonymous while at the same time offers advertisers some form of tangible assurance that their advertising messages are targeted would be beneficial.

The present invention provides a method to offer some tangible assurance to advertisers that their content is being viewed by individuals who are interested and more likely to buy the merchandise being embodied in the advertisement than a random individual would be.

The present invention provides in general an apparatus system and method for facilitating and conducting electronic marketing and customer retention using a virtual currency in the form of electronic points as a medium of exchanging and or rewarding the attention of a given Internet consumer. Individual web surfers who use the present invention are referred to herein as users. As an individual user accesses and explores Internet based websites services and or other sources of media of certain companies affiliated with the present electronic marketing and customer retention system such individual user is rewarded by being given a plurality of electronic points.

Later as an individual user accesses and explores the websites or other media sources of certain other companies affiliated with the present electronic marketing and customer retention system such an individual may redeem predetermined quantities of these previously earned electronic points in exchange for access to certain otherwise restricted media. The ability of an individual Internet web surfer to use this marketing and customer retention system is not predicated upon the user s expenditure of cash or other forms of tangible consideration nor is it predicated upon the user allowing the company to sell or otherwise profit from any personal information of the user that could have been gathered electronically.

Moreover the present invention does not require the utilization of conventional electronic advertising mechanisms such as pop up ads banner ads e mail marketing e mail spam Rich Media Ads interstitial ads online classified ads and search engine results. Of course the owner operator of a website who is affiliated with the present electronic marketing and customer retention system may opt to continue to additionally use such conventional electronic advertising mechanisms.

Additionally a user who has accumulated what is deemed by certain predetermined settings or parameters of the system predetermined to be a sufficient number of electronic points will be able to spend those points in a manner permitting the user to legitimately circumvent many models of current online advertising that are considered by many to be annoying or intrusive. For example many web surfers currently must watch pre video commercials before they view certain desired video media content made available to them through many websites that stream videos such as for example video news segments. Such accumulated electronic points can also be redeemed for a large variety of intangible virtual goods social networking apps smartphone apps music downloads video game expansions add ons character upgrades secret in game weapons and any manner of current and future virtual goods. The electronic points can be redeemed for any content that is prohibited to those who do not exchange a predetermined quantity of electronic points for access to such content. These electronic points may vary in for example value name market lifetime geographic distribution class convertibility and in other ways without deviating from the scope of the present invention.

In addition to the custom application specific software data system and methods of the present invention the present invention utilizes conventional off the shelf software components computers servers networks information management services databases session management and other technologies and electronics associated with modern computing and communication. Moreover it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that currently unspecified and future developed methods of human and computer interaction will provide a suitable opportunity for the distribution accumulation and marketing of the electronic points of the present invention and that usage of such human computer interaction does not depart from the scope of the present invention.

While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail several specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is intended as an exemplification of the principles of the present invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated.

Referring to the electronically interconnected computer environment and apparatus of the present invention is shown. Much of the digital processes and systems management functions of the present invention are controlled and run on one or more servers . Any number of servers may be connected to an external network such as the Internet. A wide variety of types of user interface devices enabled to access network may interact with the present invention via communication with servers . Devices may comprise many different communication devices including laptop computers desktop computer network enabled televisions gaming consoles smartphones tablets and any other kind of current or future communication device . Servers run a plurality of software programs for the purposes of performing management functions of the present invention including managing the number of points accumulated by a user given out by vendors and received by redeemers authenticating users registering new users managing payment and financial transactions performing Internet searches accessing databases and routing traffic over the network. Network enabled devices are connected to servers through external network and are used by users who are utilizing the present invention to visit affiliate websites or otherwise access affiliate media in order to accumulate and redeem points manage their user accounts send search queries to search engines in order to find more websites also using the present invention. Devices make use of programming languages to run execute interpret or otherwise make use of the code necessary to utilize and cooperate with the present invention.

Of course the various functions performed by server computer may alternatively be performed by several server computers interacting through one or more networks. Moreover the functions performed by network enabled device may alternatively be performed by several computers acting jointly such as by interacting through one or more networks. These distributions of tasks may be done for example for performance reasons.

Referring to server is shown as comprising several hardware components including processor network interface storage and memory . These components cooperate in conjunction with associated firmware and software to perform the tasks required of server .

Referring to in a preferred embodiment of the invention certain computer logic desirable or necessary to run and manage the present invention is disposed inside centralized data center incorporating a plurality of servers as a part of centralized server cluster . Data center is connected to external network through edge router . Edge router is preferably a networking appliance designed to control and organize traffic in a network. In turn edge router is connected to firewall which is designed to filter and protect against unauthorized and unwanted communications between computer networks or hosts. On the protected side of firewall lies a cluster of servers demilitarized zone providing web services via the Internet that typically are not considered to be critical from a security standpoint. Demilitarized zone provides amongst other services static content web services that handle commonly requested web address accesses Domain Name System services that assist routers in intercommunication between other servers and other miscellaneous front end services. Front end services like static content web services and domain name services are services that do not require the highest security protocols. They are thus less protected and in turn they are accessed and used more quickly. Adjacent to this moderate security area is second firewall tasked with directly protecting a back end portion of data center . Back end services are high security applications which necessarily have access to sensitive user and clientele data. Such information includes such data as usernames passwords email addresses number of accumulated points dates of registration ages business names credit card information payments given out payments received other financial account information points given out points redeemed cryptographic services and authentication services. Amongst other functions back end servers access databases programming languages executable and interpretable programs in order to handle the processes they are in control over.

Referring back to servers of server cluster communicate amongst themselves and with miscellaneous network connected devices distributed throughout the external network with text based messages. These text based messages adhere to predetermined messaging protocols and contain information that is of relevance to the sender and receiver of the message. This information includes authentication data status messages point count data and other information needed for servers or network connected devices to process any given request.

Referring to there are in general four different types of geographically dispersed computer and server systems connected to external network employed by the present invention. First there is network enabled device . Network enabled device allows a user to access web content and services exposed by back end server . Second there is back end server which services text based messages and other messages sent by and between the major computer components of the present invention. Third there are third party affiliate vendor servers . These third party servers control the points distributed by any particular affiliate vendor. Fourth there are third party affiliate redeemer servers . These third party servers control the points redeemed by any particular affiliate redeemer. Vendor server can access both network enabled device and back end server but cannot access the redeemer server . Likewise redeemer server can access both network enabled device and back end server but cannot access the vendor server .

Referring to when server sends a text based message server first encapsulates the message. Next the encapsulated data is marshaled into a form recognizable as a valid function call to a target computer of the clientele. This target computer maintained by the clientele is located in or interfaced to external network . The marshaled data may comprise for example a form of remote procedure call. This marshaled data is down converted through the Open Systems Interconnection OSI model layers . The OSI is an internationally standardized interface between hardware and software that allows streamlined intercommunication between various electronics and computer architectures. The down conversion through the OSI layers is primarily handled by network hardware inside computers via network interface . Next the data is sent across the physical connection . On the other side of physical connection a targeted recipient computer at an endpoint of external network begins to up convert the message up through OSI layers . After OSI conversion the messages are sent to a software application in the target computer capable of processing remote procedure calls where the message is de marshaled . The de marshaled data is now de encapsulated before being used by the target computer.

Referring to much of the software used to implement this present invention is subdivided into a task oriented organization. For example in a preferred embodiment the present invention makes use of operating system kernel running on server which is tasked with managing miscellaneous server hardware as described in and application programs. These application programs may implement several different languages operating environments precompiled or interpretable code. These subdivided applications include static content web servers active content creation preprocessing common gateway interface database engines server resource management health checking and status report software .

Referring now data that is recorded and tracked by the present invention in a preferred embodiment is stored in one or more databases . Each database comprises an application that runs in a server which may be a dedicated database server or a shared application database server that uses computer code designed to manage a physical database which in turn may be stored in one of more physical files. This database is stored on the file system of a server . This file system is in turn located in physical storage or memory . A data structure that is designed for optimized storage and retrieval is used as the technical foundation for database . Within this data structure is an abstraction commonly referred to as columns and rows. Each column or row contains a list of specific types of variables. In a preferred embodiment a column or row has an associated name or title indicating the kind of data stored in the rest of the column or row. For example a column or row with the title of username may contain a list that contains usernames. This connection does not need to be explicit and titles of columns or rows may not give easily interpretable titles or data. Also a database can store organize and retrieve an arbitrary amount of data in nearly any form.

This database is accessed by software applications designed to manage it sometimes referred to as database engines . The functionality of this database engine is in turn invoked by any manner of application logic processing program .

Before being able to use the present invention potential user must first create an account with the operator of the present invention. After the creation of the account the user then needs to log in to use the present invention. Once logged in the user may then access any number of different affiliate websites.

Referring to the general process of user account creation which includes communication back and forth between a user s network enabled device and a back end server is shown. At the start of the process of creating a new user account software operating on a back end server will cause a service policy and other related information that the overall system operator of the present invention wishes to show new users to be displayed upon the user s network enabled device. The software will ensure that the new user accepts and agrees to the terms and conditions outlined . If the user accepts these terms the user is then asked to input certain required information and possibly some optional information otherwise if the user does not accept the terms then the user is not permitted to proceed. This required data may include a user identification name an email address of the user a password of the user or other desired information. After the input is received 1204 it is checked for consistency and acceptable password strength . If both of these checks are acceptable then the operator s server hashes the data otherwise the user is asked again to supply the same required data. Once the data is hashed the operator s server attempts to store the hashed data in a database . If there is no conflicting data currently in the database then the server authenticates the account request . If it took the user too much time to input the required information in an acceptable form the users account request will timeout and ask the user to resupply the required information. If the user has successfully had his or her account authenticated and not timed out then the account is initialized in the server. The server then informs the user of the account status and exits the process of creating the account.

A technical description of the data transmissions of a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be provided. A user activates a network enabled device that is connected to the external network . The user uses this device to send a text based message through steps of to a server using the present invention that is connected to the external network . This third party controlled server prepares a second text based message and sends it via steps to servers that are managing the present invention. In order for the message to reach servers which are located in a centralized server cluster of the message must traverse external network arrive at centralized data center pass through edge router first firewall demilitarized zone second firewall and arrive at a server tasked with handling back end services through a back end network that is not connected to anything on the front end of the last firewall .

This back end server receives the message through steps processes it through static content web servers which call an application logic processing program of which deciphers the message and decides how to handle any remote procedure calls identified within it. If a remote procedure call requesting database access is identified then the application logic processing program calls the services of a database engine which in turn access the internal data structure of the database . The database engine returns data extracted from the database to the application logic processing program which uses this data to prepare response to the text based message. During the preparation of the response to the text based message server and the software applications it is running of may update or otherwise change the data in the internal data structure or the internal data structure in database .

There are many different potential responses to the text based message that can be prepared by the application logic processing program . These responses may indicate the number of points attributed to the user s account the last web page accessed by the user the next web page the user wants to visit the authenticated or log in status of the potential or actual user the geographical location of user and other data relevant to the present invention. One skilled in the art will understand that the present invention can be used in such a way as to require other types of data to be transmitted from servers .

Once application logic processing program completes preparing a response to the text based message the response is sent back to the third party controlled server using the present invention which sent a message to back end servers . Next the third party controlled server using the present invention utilizes application logic processing program to decipher and interpret the results it received. The proper interpretation of the response sent from back end servers is predicated on the predetermined rules governing the relationship between the business entity that manages back end servers and the business entity that manages the third party servers. If the response appropriately follows these business rules then the third party servers act in a specified way. As a first example of this response if the pre existing business rules establish that all properly authenticated and logged in users receive dispensations of points each time the user views certain content hosted on the third party servers then a user gains some amount of points when viewing the specified content while logged in. The amount of points dispensed into the user s account is determined by the pre existing business rules. As a second example if the response indicates that a given user is currently logged in properly authenticated and has a sufficient number of accumulated points in their account as judged when compared to the pre existing business rules then the third party server using the present invention grants the logged in user access to otherwise restricted content. Continuing with this example since the business rules generally necessitate that the release of otherwise restricted content corresponds to the deduction of points from the users total accumulated points such a deduction will take place. The amount of points deducted will also be determined by the pre existing business rules. Of course the identities of the third parties the specific business rules required user data total point additions or subtractions necessary computer and human interaction interactive features as well as other properties of these examples can vary from this example.

Irrespective of the particular business rules once the third party servers using the present invention compare the business rules against the response received from back end servers the third party servers send a text based message through to network enabled device operably connected to external network . Next network enabled devices may display a human readable message to the web surfer.

A high level description of the general functionality of a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be provided. A web surfer or other Internet user employs network enabled device to access content provided by a third party through external network . The accessing of this content does not necessarily require a purchase of any goods or services and may comprise for example only the viewing of a single webpage. In general the business rules or criteria that are predetermined for a given third party may dispense points as a result of nearly any interaction with the web surfer or user otherwise accessing media content of the third party. The web surfer may see a connection established between device and the third party servers assuming for descriptive purposes that the web surfer is knowingly attempting to establish a network connection and explore the websites and online content of a third party that is dispensing points. A user will expect to see visual notification of said points being added to the user s account. After the third party website has successfully established a connection with the device a certain number of points in accordance with pre established criteria or business rules will be deposited into the account of the user. This is all predicated on the logging in and authentication of the user a connection between the third party servers and the back end server and the following of the appropriate business rules.

Referring to in a preferred embodiment when logged into the present invention s system via the operator s server the user sees or otherwise experiences on the user s network enabled device a slightly different version of the Internet websites than the user would otherwise normally encounter. The present invention uses a number of different technologies to accomplish this. In an embodiment of the present invention among other changes to the user s browsing experience implemented by the present invention is the addition of toolbar in the use s web browser at the top of the webpage window just below the top portion of the browser . In toolbar progress bar or other indicator gradually fills or increases in value as the user accumulates points and empties or decreases in value as the user spends or users previously acquired points. Accordingly progress bar serves as an instantaneous indicator of how many points the user has accumulated and is currently available for use. Progress bar may be enhanced or replaced by a simple counter that numerically indicates the number of points the user has acquired. Also in toolbar application interface has been added to the screen and includes convenient hyperlinks that may be of interest to the user. Another item inside toolbar is a communication region reserved for messages issued to the user. There is also a software based mechanism added to that allows the content within the browser to be programmatically hidden behind an obscuring veil making the other rendered content unusable. All other aspects of the browser remain unchanged.

Referring to user accesses first affiliate vendor website . The third party business entity who manages this website is called a vendor because they typically offer or promote goods or services for sale through their website and because they are able to dispense points to users via the present invention. Because user accesses content provided by first vendor website first vendor website dispenses an appropriate and predetermined amount of points to user . As a result the number of points in the user s account is increased by the number of points given out by the vendor. User may then navigate to a new website that may be for example a separate second vendor website controlled by another possibly distinct third party business entity. Because user accesses content provided by second vendor website second website dispenses points to the user . User may then navigate to another new website that may be a separate nth vendor website controlled by another possibly distinct nth party. Because user accesses content provided by nth vendor website nth website dispenses points to the user . This process whereby user navigates through numerous possibly separate vending websites and receives dispensations of points for this navigation and or interaction with the websites could continue for an unlimited amount of navigation and or interactivity as well as for an unlimited number of vendors subject only to their affiliation with an operator of the present invention.

The points accumulated through such traversal of a large number of affiliate vending websites may all be identical. It is possible to implement the present invention in a manner such that no point may be distinguishable from any other point. It is also possible to implement the present invention such that all third party vendors are not aware of the number of points distributed by any other vendors. Moreover variable amounts of information may be transferred between any of the parties using the present invention. Furthermore the points permitted to be distributed by a particular third party vendor may be made to be identifiable and thus distinguishable from the points distributed by other third party vendors.

Referring to the required several steps that a user must perform in order to receive points from a vendor starting from a non logged in status is shown. When the user initiates the login process the operator server requests account information of the user and the user inputs it using a network enabled device. The server then analyzes this information and checks its validity . If the information is correct then the user is free to explore the Internet via for example a web browser enhanced with system components as described above. If the information is incorrect the user is not logged in and is instead redirected back to the request for account information. Once successfully logged in the user then proceeds to browse various vendor websites and explores their content . When the user explores the content of a particular vendor website that has previously established a business relationship with an operator of the present invention the associated vendor server then causes the number of points in the users account to increase by a predetermined amount . This results in the operators database being updated and then the users own display being updated to reflect the change in point total. Each time the user acquires points in this manner the operator s server the user and the relevant vendor s server are all informed of the transaction.

Referring to user then accesses a first affiliate redeemer website . The third party business entity who manages this website is called a redeemer because they accept points as a consideration which they may later redeem with the operator of the present invention for a monetary payment or other goods or services. Because user accesses content provided by first redeemer website first redeemer website may be given points by the user in exchange for providing the user with certain goods or services As a result the number of points in the user s account is lessened by the number of points used in the trade with the redeemer. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will commonly feature the goods and services offered by the redeemer that can be given to the user via the user s network enabled device using the external network such as for example providing the user with access to certain desirable media such as film clips music or other audio visual or audiovisual materials or other content including access provided by streaming media and or file download methods of distribution. Although this may be a commonplace occurrence within the operation of the present invention the redeemer may alternatively or in addition offer goods or services to user that are not distributed or distributable over the network connection. User may then navigate to a new affiliate website that may be separate second redeemer website controlled by another possibly distinct third party business entity. Because user accesses content provided by second redeemer website second website may likewise be given points by user in exchange for certain other goods or services. User may then navigate to a new website that may be separate nth redeemer website controlled by yet another possibly distinct third party. Because user accesses content provided by nth redeemer website the nth website may likewise be given points by user in exchange for certain other goods or services. This process whereby user uses a web browser or other application to navigate through numerous possibly separate redeeming websites and trades previously received points for certain goods and services could continue for an unlimited amount of navigation and or interactivity as well as for an unlimited number of redeemers subject only by the amount of points the user has accumulated and the redeemers affiliation with an operator of the present invention.

The points traded to redeemers from users in the manner described above are the same points the web surfers received from the vendors. As such all of the qualities and characteristics of the points such as their actual or perceived value are the same. Moreover an anonymity related benefit of the present invention is that no redeemer is notified or otherwise made aware of any trade between a user and another redeemer. More generally no redeemer or vendor necessarily has to be notified or otherwise made aware of any point transaction between a user and any other redeemer or vendor other than transactions involving themselves. Redeemers only need to be aware that the web surfer has accumulated points and may be ignorant of where the points came from i.e. which vendor affiliate was the source of such points . Though not necessarily a part of a preferred embodiment of the present invention variable amounts of information in both the quantitative and qualitative sense may be transferred or permitted to be transferred between any of the parties using the present invention. Moreover points may alternatively be made to be identifiable and thus distinguishable however it is not necessary for points to have these qualities.

Referring to if a user has previously registered an account with an operator of the present invention then the user can attempt to log in to the system. Assuming that the user passes all authentication checks the user will be granted access to the system. Now that the user has been logged in to the system the user can explore numerous different affiliated websites via for example a web browser enhanced for use in conjunction with the present system in the manner described above in search of content or media that is desirable to the user. If a user attempts to access a redeemer s website then the system checks to see if the current user presently has acquired sufficient i.e. and equal or greater quantity of points in comparison to the number of points required by the interactive or other content attempted to be accessed on the redeemer s site. If the user does have sufficient points in comparison to the number of points required by the redeemer s site then the user s point count is adjusted by the system to reflect the deduction of points which was requested by the redeemer s server. This deduction is made in database which stores information including aggregate point total information pertaining to the user. Next the redeemer server allows 1404 the user to see or otherwise access what is otherwise restricted content. If on the other hand the user does not have sufficient points in comparison to the number of points that is required by the redeemer s site then no modifications are made to the database and access to the restricted content remains prohibited to the user. In this case the redeemer provides an indication to the user of the shortage of points in their account and may optionally lower the number of points required by the particular user to gain access to restricted content. If the number of points is lowered by the redeemer to an amount of points less than or equal to the number of points the user has then the user proceeds toward access of the restricted content and has their point count lowered . If the redeemer instead does not lower the point requirement or does not lower it below what would allow the user to proceed in view of the user s current total of acquired points then the user is forwarded a message urging the user to browse vendors websites or otherwise access vendor content in order to accumulate additional points .

In the present invention neither the vendors or redeemers are operating the present invention nor are they offering the present invention for sale. Rather the vendors and redeemers are interacting with the present invention as affiliates. The web surfers who are using the present invention users are using the present invention as they would use many services offered to the general public through the Internet or other external networks and thus only use and do not control the present invention. Because the affiliates and users do not control the present invention they do not have access to the full spectrum of information used by the present invention. The only entity that has access to the full spectrum of information is the operator of the present invention.

Referring to the operator of the present invention also sees and controls certain financial transactions. The financial transactions that allow the operator of the present invention to run a potentially profitable business may be carried out using a regionally accepted currency commonly referred to as money. Examples of money include but are not limited to the United States Dollars the British Pound the European Union Euro gold silver the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen. One skilled in the art will understand that there are many forms of money not listed that could be used in the business of the operator of the present invention.

Operator of the present invention receives a payment of money through a financial transaction. This payment is made by a vendor as a form of consideration for purchasing a right to distribute a limited and predetermined number of points to users of the present invention who access their websites or other content via the present system. Once points are so purchased vendor is then given the right to distribute its aforementioned number of points to users in return for the users expending their time and effort browsing the vendor s content on their website and thus exposing themselves to the promotion of the vendor s products or services.

Because users have voluntarily explored the content of vendor they receive a certain predetermined number of points per interaction with the vendor s website. These points are now associated with user who retains ownership of such points until that same user voluntarily spends or trades them at a redeemer s website.

A specific redeemer that receives points issues a message to operator via the system and in the manner described above indicating how many points the system should deduct and when and from which specific user they are to be deducted. At the same time the redeemer releases access to previously restricted content to user as the other part of the aforementioned trade. Because redeemer is causing the points to be deducted from the users account by relaying an indication of the trade to operator redeemer is in effect giving the points back to operator from whom the points originated from the perspective of the redeemer.

Next operator of the present invention engages in a financial transaction with redeemer . In this financial transaction payments of money are made from operator to redeemer in a predetermined amount that is related at least in part to the amount of points released by the redeemer in the aforementioned trade with the user.

In a preferred embodiment operator will charge to vendor a certain amount of money per point for distribution rights i.e. the right of the affiliate vendor to distribute points to authorized users via the present system. This amount of money will in a preferred embodiment be larger than the amount of money paid from the operator to the redeemer in exchange for the redeemer s release back to the operator of an equivalent number of points. For example operator of the present invention may charge 0.005 US Dollars to vendor for the right to distribute 1 point. The operator may after points have cycled through users to redeemers pay to the redeemers 0.003 US Dollars per point redeemed. Continuing with this example the operator will make 0.005 0.003 0.002 US Dollars per point cycled through the present system. This difference of 0.002 US Dollars is seen as revenue to operator . Of course the amount of money charged to affiliated vendors for the right to distribute each point and the amount of money paid to affiliated redeemers for the right to release each point back to the system and subtract same from a user s account are both variable. One skilled in the art will likewise understand that there are many more ways to engage in financial and point transactions in cooperation with the present invention. For example it is contemplated by the present invention that one website can be both a redeeming website and a vending website simultaneously so that one interaction with a user gives the user points and another interaction takes points away from the user . Indeed there are a wide variety of combinations of ways users vendors and redeemers may interact with each other and with an operator taking part in the transaction of money or points.

If user deliberately or accidentally accumulates a surplus of points that are not timely traded at a redeemer s website then the amount of money the vendors paid for these points originally may be considered to be additional revenue by operator although the operator may never be fully assured that any such points will never be redeemed in the future and thus never be fully assured that the amount vendors paid to operator is necessarily entirely revenue.

Referring to additional reasons that the financial and point transactions are taking place in the present invention are shown. One reason is that redeemers have valuable and desirable content that they would like to distribute to users . In order for these redeemers to be able to provide this valuable content they typically must generate revenue and be profitable. Through the present invention users can view high quality valuable content on the Internet without the redeemer having to generate revenue by resorting to what are often perceived by users as annoying distracting time wasting or otherwise unsolicited or undesired forms of supporting advertisement i.e. advertising supported content requiring direct financial payment from the users or other conventional ways of generating revenue.

Through such financial and point transactions provided via the present invention vendors can reward users for engaging in what some may refer to as digital window shopping at their websites. The vendors are in effect paying users points in return for exposure or attention that vendors receive from users . This increase in exposure may potentially correlate to amongst other things better brand recognition for vendor better customer retention and or increased sales. As users explore the websites of affiliated vendors who offer points in order for such users to accumulate the aforementioned points users may be presented with promotional materials for new and exciting goods and services for sale at vendors websites.

In general users want to spend a portion of their free or leisure time consuming electronic media being presented to them through the Internet . The desire of many users to consume this electronic media is sufficient to entice such users to regularly accumulate points at many different vendors websites.

Referring to a preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes a relational database i.e. database composed of a set of interrelated tables. For example a table of the database may be dedicated to storing information relative to users another table for vendors yet another table for redeemers and another table still for financial data . Continuing with this example of database implementation each table is composed of specific uniquely identifiable named database table fields or variables of specified variable types. In more detail there are many variables used and each such variable is predefined and fixed to be a specific type of variable. In variables of the following types are shown INT representing is an integer VARCHAR 45 representing a character string of variable length and at most 45 characters in length DATE representing a calendar date TEXT representing a moderately long string of human readable text and LONG TEXT representing a relatively long string of human readable text. As shown in there are also many different variables used with the particular associated variable type being shown immediately after each variable name in tables .

User table includes but is not necessarily limited to variables such as a table identification name that increments for each new user a system login user name the age of the user in years that could alternatively be stored as a date of birth the current number of points in the user s account date of registration country of registration a cryptographic hash of the user s password the user s most recent IP address whether or not the user is currently logged in the number of different network enabled devices the user has used to log in during the current session whether or not the user has read the End User License Agreement or other terms whether the user has agreed to those terms the email address of the user and the participating user s history of point transactions which records at every specified period of time how many points are in the user s account .

Vendor table of includes but is not necessarily limited to variables such as a table identification value that increments for each newly added vendor vendor name vendor s system login user name a cryptographic hash of the vendor s password a randomly assigned and unique vendor identification number vendor payment history points the vendor has given out points the vendor has redeemed the history of the points given out the history of the points that the vendor has redeemed the identification number tokenization of the vendor that permits the financial servicing of a third party in a manner that does not expose the third party s sensitive financial details to the system operator number of administrators of the vendor the vendor administrator s user name and password hashes the number of points the vendor gives out for each user interaction the number of points the vendor redeems for each user interaction and the telephone number or other contact information of the vendor s main administrator .

Redeemer table of includes but is not necessarily limited to variables such as a table identification name that increments for each newly added redeemer redeemer name the redeemer s user name a cryptographic hash of the redeemer s password a randomly assigned vendor identification number redeemer payment history points the redeemer has given out points the redeemer has redeemed the history of the points given out the history of the points that the redeemer has redeemed the identification number tokenization of the redeemer that permits the financial servicing of a third party in a manner that does not expose the third party s sensitive financial details to the system operator number of administrators of the redeemer the redeemer administrator s user name and password hashes the number of points the redeemer gives out for each user interaction the number of points the redeemer redeems for each user interaction and the telephone number or other contact information of the main administrator or alternatively any other contact information.

Financial table of includes but is not necessarily limited to variables such as a table identification name that increments for each new financial record associated with a redeemer an affiliate s sign up date the affiliate s name the identification number tokenization the contact phone number the contact email address the payment method the payment gateway payment password hash payment currency payment personal identification number payment username payment account number and payment account type .

Of course the data described above relative to is one method of many possible methods of storing organizing and using relevant data in a database for an application such as the present invention. Possible alternative methods of storing organizing and using the relevant data in conjunction with the present invention may include but is not necessarily limited to consolidating different data elements and tables expanding or adding different data elements and tables changing the variable types defining how data elements are stored changing the names of different data elements and removing different database elements.

Referring to in a preferred embodiment affiliate servers including both vendor and redeemer servers operator servers and user s device all communicate electronically with each other through the use of various software modules written in programming code. User s device has a program stored on it that is capable of accessing affiliate servers and operator servers through some method a preferred method being through the use of web browser application . When user logs into the system the browser application simultaneously and transparently queries the front end servers of the system operator for a standard package of software to download which contains a user side in browser logic program which may comprise for example a browser plug in extension or interpretable script dependencies and in browser frame which is primarily included in dependencies . Front end servers are preferably located inside demilitarized zone and in response to the aforementioned query from the user s browser application responds with standard software package to browser . Software package may be downloaded transparently and may be temporary in nature as it may be easily deleted as a result of user actions.

After user is logged in and has downloaded standardized package of user can navigate browser to any website on the external network the user wishes. If the user navigates to a website containing an application programming interface API managed by affiliate servers a system of electronic interactions following a predefined protocol as permitted by the API is initiated. In this method of implementing the preferred embodiment of the present invention this API has been previously provided to the affiliate by the system operator and implemented by the affiliate at some earlier date.

First to initiate this sequence of interactions the browser sends a query to an API installed on the affiliate servers that contains the request for website content the user s randomly assigned identification and a cryptographic hash for authenticating the query. The API then sends a second query to the back end interface that contain the user s randomly assigned identification the same cryptographic hash and other additional parameters to define the nature of the website content requested. The additional parameters in a preferred embodiment describe but are not limited to the description of the number of points to be vended the number of points to be redeemed contingent upon the proper number of points in user s account and an age requirement of the user. Upon receipt of this second query the back end interface communicates with the database engines to first authenticate the original query. If the authentication is successful back end interface proceeds to interact with database engines to decide on the result of the query that is situation dependant.

If the user is properly authenticated several different responses to the second query are possible. If the affiliate is attempting to vend points to user unless there are some age restrictions or other extenuating factors which must first be processed back end interface instructs database engines to update the number of points in the account of user and retrieves the updated value. This new value and a message indicating the success of the authentication are sent in a response to API on vendor servers . API then accesses content originally requested that is otherwise prohibited on vendor servers and relays such content and an updated point total to browser application . The browser then displays web content originally requested in frame inside of browser and updates toolbar through the use of standard software package .

If the affiliate is attempting to redeem points from user unless there are some age restrictions or other extenuating factors which must first be processed back end interface requests database engines to report the current number of points in the account of user .

If the number of points in the user s account is less than the number of points to be redeemed back end interface responds to the second query with a message indicating that the user has been authenticated but does not have a sufficient number of points in the user s account to access the restricted content requested by the user. This message is sent from the back end interface to the on affiliate servers . API then ascertains what content the user may be permitted to access via browser given the user s relatively limited number of aggregate points which may be no content at all. This limited content which does not include the restricted content that was originally requested by the user is then sent from affiliate servers to browser . Affiliate servers also send browser a message indicating that the user does not have the required number of points to view the restricted content. Browser then renders this limited content or no content at all and a message indicating that the content is limited or completely restricted or that user does not currently have enough points.

If the number of points in the user s account is greater than or equal to the number of points to be redeemed back end interface instructs database engines to decrement the number of points in the account of user account to reflect the amount of points currently being redeemed. Back end interface then responds to the second query with a message indicating that the user has been authenticated does have a sufficient number of points in the user s account to access the otherwise restricted content and the updated value of the amount of points in the user s account. This message is sent from back end interface to API on affiliate servers . API then retrieves the specific content that browser has requested access to. Affiliate servers then send this requested content to browser along with the updated number of points in the account of user . Browser then renders the content and in browser frame updates the number of points in the account of user in a manner that is visible to user .

If the query is sent to API installed on affiliate servers that contains the request for website content but is missing either a randomly assigned identification or a cryptographic hash then the API will in a preferred embodiment respond with a message asking the web surfer to log in to use the present invention. If a query of standard and expected format is sent to API that does not correspond to an authenticated user then back end interface will after the authentication test fails respond to API to indicate the failure. If the original query would have also earned the would be user points no points are awarded because the original query did not correspond to an authenticated user. If the original query requested access to restricted content no access is granted. The API will respond appropriately by responding to the original query indicating no change in points in any account and allowing access only to non restricted content.

Affiliate servers may have content available to web surfers who are not logged in as users as well as users who are presently logged in. This content does not interact with API or operator servers does not differentiate logged in users from other web surfers in any manner and is generally conventional content provided by the affiliates that are not affiliated with the present invention similar to content on any other server in the external network who is not an affiliate server and is not affiliated with the operator of the present invention in any manner.

Referring to a preferred embodiment of the present invention may allow the necessary communication between the affiliate servers operator servers and a user s device through an alternative method that increases the use of affiliate servers and reduces the use of operator servers . In some circumstances this alternative method may be desirable over the method described above relative to .

In this method it is much more easily allowable that user will have his Uniform Resource Locator read as a web address that begins with the domain name of the affiliate s website as opposed to the domain name of the operator s website. Another key difference in this method is that operator servers likely have less traffic to handle which may be desirable as well as a smaller amount of data to store in operator s servers . In turn affiliate servers must employ a larger API and will likely have more traffic to handle. This alternative method is primarily achieved by including a standard software package in the API on affiliate servers in addition to a different standard software package that is stored on operator s servers as opposed to keeping the aforementioned standard software package that is used in the method described by on operator servers .

In this method a logged in user may still navigate browser to any website on the external network that user wishes. If user navigates to a website containing an application programming interface API managed by affiliate servers a similar system of interactions is initiated. API must have been given to the affiliate by the operator earlier for this method of implementing an embodiment of the present invention.

First to initiate this system of interactions browser sends a query to API installed on affiliate servers in order to request content. API then uploads a first standard software package to the web surfer s device which must contain user side in browser logic program dependencies and in browser frame . When run software package downloads to device of user second standard software package which also contains user side in browser logic program dependencies and an in browser frame . Though software packages contain the same general kinds of elements the elements themselves differ in that they support different respective tasks. Browser then uses the two software packages to render two different in browser frames . First software package causes large in browser frame to appear in the browser window taking up all of the space in the browser window except where toolbar is located. Second software package causes a small in browser frame to appear in the browser window that is toolbar . The large in browser frame contains the rest of the accessed content of the website targeted by the user.

The specific content that is accessed and placed in large in browser frame is determined by the nature of the original query the authenticity of user and the number of points in the account of user in the manner described above relative to . The relevant differences in this method are relative to what tasks each server is performing in order to produce the same ultimate results. In this method toolbar s of in browser frame queries back end interface directly to refresh any of the elements in toolbar such as with the textual content of messages or an updated value of the number of points in the account of user .

The connection of browser s to back end interface through in browser frame contained in second software package a downloadable first software package the functionality of software package being split between the two other software packages and the storing of one of software packages in API on affiliate servers are the fundamental differences between this presently described method and the one previously described with reference to .

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention activity of users are tracked while users are both having points vended to them by vendor affiliates and when users are redeeming points with redeemer affiliates. Effectively any action that could be taken by the interface device of user could be used to trigger point transactions. In general affiliates will be the parties that dictate what event s will trigger point transactions according to their own motivations and what they would like to accomplish with a user s time and attention.

Some examples of events that may trigger point transactions for vendors include a user clicking on internal content in a vendor website that allows vendors to vend in such a way to as to incentivize user interaction with vendor content a user spending a certain amount of time on a vendor website or a user navigating to a different webpage on the vendor website. Vendors could give out points for specified interaction on a per time basis or on a pages viewed basis. For example relative to time spent by a user on vendor websites vendors could give out points at a high rate for the first ten minutes and at a diminished rate after the first ten minutes have past. The vendors could give out points according to an opposite rate as well or give out a high amount of points for a specified interaction of user and less for normally viewing any additional page or according to nearly any other methodology that vendors may desire. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a number of different events could be used to trigger point transactions between a user and a vendor. Events that can be used to trigger such point transactions are limited only by the ability of a vendor to interact with a user interface of a network enabled user device.

Some examples of events that could trigger point transactions for redeemers include users clicking on internal content in a redeemer website thus requiring the user to pay points to interact with a redeemer website users spending a certain amount of time on a redeemer website again requiring the user to pay points to view a redeemer website redeemer could redeem points on a flat point per time basis redeemer could redeem points according to how long a user has been at their website redeemers could leverage different types of content by requiring the user payment and redeemer receipt of different amounts of points for viewing different internal content redeemers could receive points from user when the user first visits the redeemer s content redeemer could receive points upon providing a particular service to user or redeemers could receive points upon providing a product to a user including files downloadable to the user s network enabled device. For example redeemers could give out points at a high rate for the first ten minutes and at a diminished rate after the first ten minutes have past. Redeemers could give out points according to an opposite rate as well or give out a high amount of points for a specified interaction of user and less for normally viewing any additional page or according to nearly any other methodology the redeemers may desire. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a number of different events could be used to trigger point transactions between a user and a redeemer. Events that can be used to trigger such point transactions are limited only by the ability of a redeemer to interact with a user interface of a network enabled user device.

Referring to message format of data sent by and between the various servers and network enabled devices used in the present invention is designed in general for efficient generation and processing. Data is preferably transmitted in a form that may be readily processed by the various computing equipment firmware and software implementing the present invention. Such computer equipment includes but is not necessarily limited to network routers servers network enabled devices web browsers browser based logic programs compiled code and interpreted code. A preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes text based format used for messaging.

Such text based format has within it many different subsections . Each subsection is identified with a special set of alpha numeric characters . This special set of alpha numeric characters is composed of a string of characters which would not normally appear in common text. Examples of such non standard characters in strings include but are not necessarily limited to or variable name time variable value 12 30 pm . By using such structured sets of generally human readable data stored in text based format developer or operator of the present invention can readily visually inspect data being sent by and between all electronic and computer equipment responsible for running and maintaining the present invention without the requirement for complex data analyzers. Moreover the use of such structured sets of relatively human readable data stored in text based format permits all electronic and computer equipment systems involved in the present invention to relatively easily extract data as such structured data contains many regular patterns . In turn regular patterns allow electronic and computer equipment to access and manipulate any data stored in such a relatively human readable text based message .

An example of what such text based message may contain as data includes but is not necessarily limited to the following user name date type of point transaction number of points used in transaction destination location of sender function call numbers account information pin numbers etc.

Of course any number of different messaging formats may alternatively be employed in the present invention. Moreover any number of different types of data variable names structures characters character sets fonts font sizes font colors emoticons concatenations message lengths file names file extensions encoding systems encryption systems programming languages spoken languages justifications arrangements arguments markup languages printing languages calendars counting systems enumerations categorizations alphabetizations could likewise be used in the present invention.
