The present invention is related to a security system that may be used to determine an appropriate application application environment and or access or security control measure based at least in part on using an application controller program to evaluate a file s reputation information.

Computer security is increasingly important and protecting files and computer systems from malware containing files has become increasingly difficult. A need exists to improve file security and malware protection systems.

An aspect of the present invention relates to the treatment and management of files based on an understanding of their history and or reputation. The invention in certain embodiments involves acquiring an understanding of a file s reputation possibly based on a number of factors or just an understanding of whether it came from a trusted source and then opening the file through a software application that treats the file in accordance with its reputation. The software application may be chosen and or launched through an application manager once the file s reputation is understood. For example the application manager may understand that a file has been received from the Internet and thus judge its reputation as suspect. Once judged as suspicious the application manager may cause the file to be opened by a software application that is adapted to manage suspicious files. This software application may also operate in a virtual space that is separated from more secure spaces of a computer or computer network to prevent possible problems that may be caused by the suspicious file. The application manager may treat a trusted file in a similar manner by choosing an application based on the trusted nature of the file for opening the file. For example if a file was generated by a trusted program and only communicated through an intranet the file may be considered trusted or of a high reputation. In this event the application manager may choose a software application adapted to manage trusted files to open the trusted file. This software application may also be in a virtual environment but more likely it is in a less restrictive environment because there is no apparent reason to keep the file separated from other environments in the computer or computer network because of the file s trusted nature.

In addition to choosing a software application instance of a software application or environment for the management of the file the application controller may be used to further manage the file. For example the application controller may be used to attach to or otherwise associate information with the file such that the file s reputation can be further assessed. The application controller may also manage where the file can go. For example an application adapted to treat suspicious files may not have the ability to send the file to environments within the computer or computer network that are not set up to manage suspicious files. Similarly an application adapted to manage trusted files may not be able to send a file out through the Internet or other such open network. Or it may not be able to do so without providing a warning or associating some information about the transmission.

In embodiments of the present invention a framework for an extensible file based security system may be used to determine an appropriate application application environment and or access or security control measure based at least in part on a file s reputation. A file s reputation may be recorded and stored at least in part in metadata or some other form of information that can be associated with the file hereinafter we will generally refer to this type of information as metadata but it should be understood that we intend the term metadata to generally refer to data that is associated with other data a file etc. . Metadata may define access and security parameters or some other parameter of a file. The access security or other parameters recorded in the metadata may conform to and or implement a corporate policy. The metadata may be stored in association with the file appended to the file linked to the file in a database or plurality of databases including a remote database or plurality of databases or otherwise encoded to relate to the file in such a manner that the metadata and its related file may be read together or near simultaneously. The metadata may be used to control the access and security settings of the file and to require that only an approved method of gaining access to the file or any of the file s contents is used and that the method and use of the file is in accord with the access and security parameter definitions in the metadata which embody the corporate policy.

In embodiments in response to the selection of a file an application controller may be used to select a software application from two or more software applications to open the selected file based at least in part on the selected file s reputation. If launched a software application may be configured to open the file in an environment such as a virtual machine quarantined environment and the like that is appropriate for the file based at least in part on the reputation information that is associated with the file. In embodiments a software application may be a secure software application configured to manage secure files or an insecure software application configured to manage insecure files. The software application may be selected and may launch a selected file based at least in part on the reputation information that is associated with the file. The selected file and all communications relating to the selected software application may be managed according to the selected software application s secure or insecure configuration.

In embodiments an application controller software program may be used to select a software application to launch a file and to select an appropriate environment or virtual environment in which to launch the software application. The application controller may be associated with a plurality of machines including virtual machines in which a file may be launched. The application controller may identify store update modify create read or otherwise manipulate reputation information that is associated with the file e.g. reputation metadata including all subsequent files that are created and or modified by a selected application. The reputation information may be stored within the application controller or remotely stored in a database independent of the application controller but which is accessible by the application controller. The reputation information may be stored in association with the file. The application controller may manage evaluate analyze read and store communications that are associated with a file. In embodiments communications that are associated with a file may include network communications device communications e.g. USB memory device network access communications file access communications process access communications memory access communications or some other type of communication. In embodiments the reputation information that is associated with a file may be metadata relating to the file format of the selected file the originating location of the selected file e.g. an Internet URL a location on an intranet a server address an IP address a UDP address a memory location a disk drive a folder path a CPU a plurality of locations etc. one or more prior locations where the selected file was previously located or some other type of reputation information. Reputation information may be metadata relating to an application that may be used to open the file.

In embodiments in response to an attempted access of a selected file the application controller may select a software application from at least two software applications to open the selected file based on the selected file s reputation. The at least two software applications may be configured to open the file if launched wherein one of the at least two software applications is a secure software application configured to manage secure files and one of the at least two software applications is an insecure software application configured to manage insecure files. Following the selection of an appropriate software application to use to open the file the selected software application may be launched in order to open the selected file. The secure application and or insecure application may be launched in a first machine a second machine or a plurality of machines including but not limited to virtual machines machines running in a quarantined environment machines running with restricted operational privileges and capabilities and the like. The application controller may be used to manage the selected file and all communications relating to the selected software application in accordance with the selected software application s secure or insecure configuration which may be based at least in part on the selected file s reputation. In embodiments communications may include network communications device communications e.g. USB memory device network access communications file access communications process access communications memory access communications or some other type of communication.

In embodiments in response to an attempted access of a selected file the application controller may select a software application from at least two software applications to open the selected file based on the selected file s reputation. The at least two software applications may be configured to open the file if launched wherein one of the at least two software applications is a secure software application configured to manage secure files and one of the at least two software applications is an insecure software application configured to manage insecure files. Following the selection of an appropriate software application to use to open the file the selected software application may be launched in order to open the selected file. The secure application and or insecure application may be launched in a first machine a second machine or a plurality of machines including but not limited to virtual machines machines running in a quarantined environment machines running with restricted operational privileges and capabilities and the like. The application controller may enable the selected application to further associate reputation information with the selected file such that the selected file is maintained in a condition that directs how it should be treated in the future. This may include but is not limited to updating recording and or storing reputation metadata and associating the metadata with the file. In another example embodiment the application controller may cause the selected application to associate similar reputation information as that for the selected file with a second file that is interacted with by the selected software application. Further the selected software application may associate reputation information with all files that are modified and or created by the selected software application including at least in part reputation information matching that of the selected file.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

While the invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments other embodiments would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed herein.

It should be understood that the threat management facility may provide multiple services and policy management may be offered as one of the services. We will now turn to a description of certain capabilities and components of the threat management system .

Over recent years malware has become a major problem across the internet . From both technical and user perspectives the categorization of a specific threat type whether as virus worm spam phishing exploration spyware adware or the like is becoming reduced in significance. The threat no matter how it is categorized may need to be stopped at various points of a networked computing environment such as one of an enterprise facility including at one or more laptops desktops servers such as the server facility gateways communication ports handheld or mobile devices firewalls and the like. Similarly there may be less and less benefit to the user in having different solutions for known and unknown threats. As such a consolidated threat management facility may need to apply a similar set of technologies and capabilities for all threats. In certain embodiments the threat management facility may provide a single agent on the desktop and a single scan of any suspect file. This approach may eliminate the inevitable overlaps and gaps in protection caused by treating viruses and spyware as separate problems while simultaneously simplifying administration and minimizing desktop load. As the number and range of types of threats has increased so may have the level of connectivity available to all IT users. This may have lead to a rapid increase in the speed at which threats may move. Today an unprotected PC connected to the internet may be infected quickly perhaps within 10 minutes which may require acceleration for the delivery of threat protection. Where once monthly updates may have been sufficient the threat management facility may automatically and seamlessly update its product set against spam and virus threats quickly for instance every five minutes every minute continuously or the like. Analysis and testing may be increasingly automated and also may be performed more frequently for instance it may be completed in 15 minutes and may do so without compromising quality. The threat management facility may also extend techniques that may have been developed for virus and malware protection and provide them to enterprise facility network administrators to better control their environments. In addition to stopping malicious code the threat management facility may provide policy management that may be able to control legitimate applications such as VoIP instant messaging peer to peer file sharing and the like that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility .

The threat management facility may provide an enterprise facility protection from computer based malware including viruses spyware adware Trojans intrusion spam policy abuse uncontrolled access and the like where the enterprise facility may be any entity with a networked computer based infrastructure. In an embodiment may depict a block diagram of the threat management facility providing protection to an enterprise against a plurality of threats. The enterprise facility may be corporate commercial educational governmental or the like and the enterprise facility s computer network may be distributed amongst a plurality of facilities and in a plurality of geographical locations. The threat management facility may include a plurality of functions such as security management facility policy management facility update facility definitions facility network access rules facility remedial action facility detection techniques facility testing facility threat research facility and the like. In embodiments the threat protection provided by the threat management facility may extend beyond the network boundaries of the enterprise facility to include client facilities that have moved into network connectivity not directly associated or controlled by the enterprise facility . Threats to client facilities may come from a plurality of sources such as from network threats physical proximity threats secondary location threats and the like. In embodiments the threat management facility may provide an enterprise facility protection from a plurality of threats to multiplatform computer resources in a plurality of locations and network configurations with an integrated system approach.

In embodiments the threat management facility may be provided as a stand alone solution. In other embodiments the threat management facility may be integrated into a third party product. An application programming interface e.g. a source code interface may be provided such that the threat management facility may be integrated. For instance the threat management facility may be stand alone in that it provides direct threat protection to an enterprise or computer resource where protection is subscribed to directly . Alternatively the threat management facility may offer protection indirectly through a third party product where an enterprise may subscribe to services through the third party product and threat protection to the enterprise may be provided by the threat management facility through the third party product.

The security management facility may include a plurality of elements that provide protection from malware to enterprise facility computer resources including endpoint security and control email security and control web security and control reputation based filtering control of unauthorized users control of guest and non compliant computers and the like. The security management facility may be a software application that may provide malicious code and malicious application protection to a client facility computing resource. The security management facility may have the ability to scan the client facility files for malicious code remove or quarantine certain applications and files prevent certain actions perform remedial actions and perform other security measures. In embodiments scanning the client facility may include scanning some or all of the files stored to the client facility on a periodic basis may scan applications once the application has been requested to execute may scan files as the files are transmitted to or from the client facility or the like. The scanning of the applications and files may be to detect known malicious code or known unwanted applications. In an embodiment new malicious code and unwanted applications may be continually developed and distributed and updates to the known code database may be provided on a periodic basis on a demand basis on an alert basis or the like.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for email security and control where security management may help to eliminate spam viruses spyware and phishing control of email content and the like. The security management facility s email security and control may protect against inbound and outbound threats protect email infrastructure prevent data leakage provide spam filtering and the like. In an embodiment security management facility may provide for web security and control where security management may help to detect or block viruses spyware malware unwanted applications help control web browsing and the like which may provide comprehensive web access control enabling safe productive web browsing. Web security and control may provide internet use policies reporting on suspect devices security and content filtering active monitoring of network traffic URI filtering and the like. In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for network access control which may provide control over network connections. Network control may stop unauthorized guest or non compliant systems from accessing networks and may control network traffic that may not be bypassed from the client level. In addition network access control may control access to virtual private networks VPN where VPNs may be a communications network tunneled through another network establishing a logical connection acting as a virtual network. In embodiments a VPN may be treated in the same manner as a physical network.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for host intrusion prevention through behavioral based protection which may guard against unknown threats by analyzing behavior before software code executes. Behavioral based protection may monitor code when it runs and intervene if the code is deemed to be suspicious or malicious. Advantages of behavioral based protection over runtime protection may include code being prevented from running whereas runtime protection may only interrupt code that has already partly executed behavioral protection may identify malicious code at the gateway or on the file servers and deletes it before reaching end point computers and the like.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for reputation filtering which may target or identify sources of known malware. For instance reputation filtering may include lists of URIs of known sources of malware or known suspicious IP addresses or domains say for spam that when detected may invoke an action by the threat management facility such as dropping them immediately. By dropping the source before any interaction can initiate potential threat sources may be thwarted before any exchange of data can be made.

In embodiments information may be sent from the enterprise back to a third party a vendor or the like which may lead to improved performance of the threat management facility . For example the types times and number of virus interactions that a client experiences may provide useful information for the preventions of future virus threats. This type of feedback may be useful for any aspect of threat detection. Feedback of information may also be associated with behaviors of individuals within the enterprise such as being associated with most common violations of policy network access unauthorized application loading unauthorized external device use and the like. In embodiments this type of information feedback may enable the evaluation or profiling of client actions that are violations of policy that may provide a predictive model for the improvement of enterprise policies.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for the overall security of the enterprise facility network or set of enterprise facility networks may provide updates of malicious code information to the enterprise facility network and associated client facilities . The updates may be a planned update an update in reaction to a threat notice an update in reaction to a request for an update an update based on a search of known malicious code information or the like. The administration facility may provide control over the security management facility when updates are performed. The updates may be automatically transmitted without an administration facility s direct control manually transmitted by the administration facility or the like. The security management facility may include the management of receiving malicious code descriptions from a provider distribution of malicious code descriptions to enterprise facility networks distribution of malicious code descriptions to client facilities or the like. In an embodiment the management of malicious code information may be provided to the enterprise facility s network where the enterprise facility s network may provide the malicious code information through the enterprise facility s network distribution system.

The threat management facility may provide a policy management facility that may be able to block non malicious applications such as VoIP instant messaging peer to peer file sharing and the like that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility . The policy management facility may be a set of rules or policies that may indicate enterprise facility access permissions for the client facility such as access permissions associated with the network applications external computer devices and the like. The policy management facility may include a database a text file a combination of databases and text files or the like. In an embodiment a policy database may be a block list a black list an allowed list a white list or the like that may provide a list of enterprise facility external network locations applications that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . The policy management facility may include rules that may be interpreted with respect to an enterprise facility network access request to determine if the request should be allowed. The rules may provide a generic rule for the type of access that may be granted the rules may be related to the policies of an enterprise facility for access rights for the enterprise facility s client facility . For example there may be a rule that does not permit access to sporting websites. When a website is requested by the client facility a security facility may access the rules within a policy facility to determine if the requested access is related to a sporting website. In an embodiment the security facility may analyze the requested website to determine if the website matches with any of the policy facility rules.

The policy management facility may be similar to the security management facility but with the addition of enterprise facility wide access rules and policies that may be distributed to maintain control of client facility access to enterprise facility network resources. The policies may be defined for application type subset of application capabilities organization hierarchy computer facility type user type network location time of day connection type or the like. Policies may be maintained by the administration facility through the threat management facility in association with a third party or the like. For example a policy may restrict IM activity to only support personnel for communicating with customers. This may allow communication for departments requiring access but may maintain the network bandwidth for other activities by restricting the use of IM to only the personnel that need access to IM in support of the enterprise facility . In an embodiment the policy management facility may be a stand alone application may be part of the network server facility may be part of the enterprise facility network may be part of the client facility or the like.

In embodiments the threat management facility may provide configuration management which may be similar to policy management but may specifically examine the configuration set of applications operating systems hardware and the like and managing changes to their configurations. Assessment of a configuration may be made against a standard configuration policy detection of configuration changes remediation of improper configuration application of new configurations and the like. An enterprise may keep a set of standard configuration rules and policies which may represent the desired state of the device. For example a client firewall may be running and installed but in the disabled state where remediation may be to enable the firewall. In another example the enterprise may set a rule that disallows the use of USB disks and sends a configuration change to all clients which turns off USB drive access via a registry.

In embodiments the threat management facility may also provide for the removal of applications that may interfere with the operation of the threat management facility such as competitor products that may also be attempting similar threat management functions. The removal of such products may be initiated automatically whenever such products are detected. In the case where such applications are services are provided indirectly through a third party product the application may be suspended until action is taken to remove or disable the third party product s protection facility.

Threat management against a sometimes quickly evolving malware environment may require timely updates and the update management facility may be provided by the threat management facility . In addition a policy management facility may also require update management e.g. as provided by the update facility herein described as the enterprise facility requirements for policies change enterprise facility client facility server facility enterprise facility . The update management for the security facility and policy management facility may be provided directly by the threat management facility such as by a hosted system or in conjunction with the administration facility . In embodiments the threat management facility may provide for patch management where a patch may be an update to an operating system an application a system tool or the like where one of the reasons for the patch is to reduce vulnerability to threats.

In embodiments the security facility and policy management facility may push information to the enterprise facility network and or client facility the enterprise facility network and or client facility may pull information from the security facility and policy management facility network server facilities there may be a combination of pushing and pulling of information between the security facility and the policy management facility network servers enterprise facility network and client facilities or the like. For example the enterprise facility network and or client facility may pull information from the security facility and policy management facility network server facility may request the information using the security facility and policy management facility update module the request may be based on a certain time period by a certain time by a date on demand or the like. In another example the security facility and policy management facility network servers may push the information to the enterprise facility s network and or client facility by providing notification that there are updates available for download and then transmitting the information. The combination of the security management network server facility and security update module may function substantially the same as the policy management facility network server and policy update module by providing information to the enterprise facility network and the client facility in a push or pull method. In an embodiment the policy management facility and the security facility management update modules may work in concert to provide all the needed information to the enterprise facility s network and or client facility for control of application execution. In an embodiment the policy update module and security update module may be combined into a single update module.

As threats are identified and characterized the threat management facility may create definition updates that may be used to allow the threat management facility to detect and remediate the latest malicious software unwanted applications configuration and policy changes and the like. The threat definition facility may contain threat identification updates also referred to as definition files. A definition file may be a virus identity file that may include definitions of known or potential malicious code. The virus identity IDE definition files may provide information that may identify malicious code within files applications or the like. The definition files may be accessed by security management facility when scanning files or applications within the client facility for the determination of malicious code that may be within the file or application. The definition files may contain a number of commands definitions or instructions to be parsed and acted upon or the like. In embodiments the client facility may be updated with new definition files periodically to provide the client facility with the most recent malicious code definitions the updating may be performed on a set time period may be updated on demand from the client facility may be updated on demand from the network may be updated on a received malicious code alert or the like. In an embodiment the client facility may request an update to the definition files from an update facility within the network may request updated definition files from a computing facility external to the network updated definition files may be provided to the client facility from within the network definition files may be provided to the client facility from an external computing facility from an external network or the like.

In an embodiment a definition management facility may provide for the timely updates of definition files information to the network client facilities and the like. New and altered malicious code and malicious applications may be continually created and distributed to networks worldwide. The definition files that maintain the definitions of the malicious code and malicious application information for the protection of the networks and client facilities may need continual updating to provide continual defense of the network and client facility from the malicious code and malicious applications. The definition files management may provide for automatic and manual methods of updating the definition files. In embodiments the network may receive definition files and distribute the definition files to the network client facilities the client facilities may receive the definition files directly or the network and client facilities may both receive the definition files or the like. In an embodiment the definition files may be updated on a fixed periodic basis on demand by the network and or the client facility as a result of an alert of a new malicious code or malicious application or the like. In an embodiment the definition files may be released as a supplemental file to an existing definition files to provide for rapid updating of the definition files.

In a similar manner the security management facility may be used to scan an outgoing file and verify that the outgoing file is permitted to be transmitted per the enterprise facility rules and policies. By checking outgoing files the security management facility may be able to discover malicious code infected files that were not detected as incoming files as a result of the client facility having been updated with either new definition files or policy management facility information. The definition files may discover the malicious code infected file by having received updates of developing malicious code from the administration facility updates from a definition files provider or the like. The policy management facility may discover the malicious code infected file by having received new updates from the administration facility from a rules provider or the like.

The threat management facility may provide for a way to control access to the enterprise facility networks. For instance the enterprise facility may want to restrict access to certain applications networks files printers servers databases or the like. In addition the enterprise facility may want to restrict user access under certain conditions such as the user s location usage history need to know job position connection type time of day method of authentication client system configuration or the like. Network access rules may be developed by the enterprise facility or pre packaged by a supplier and managed by the threat management facility in conjunction with the administration facility . Network access rules and control may be responsible for determining if a client facility application should be granted access to a requested network location. The network location may be on the same network as the facility or may be on another network. In an embodiment the network access control may verify access rights for client facilities from within the network or may verify access rights of computer facilities from external networks. When network access for a client facility is denied the network access control may send an information file to the client facility the information file may contain data or commands that may provide instructions for the remedial action facility . The information sent by the network access facility control may be a data file. The data file may contain a number of commands definitions instructions or commands to be parsed and acted upon through the remedial action facility or the like. The information sent by the network access facility control may be a command or command file that the remedial action facility may access and take action upon.

In an embodiment the network access rules may provide an information store to be accessed by the network access control. The network access rules facility may include databases such as a block list a black list an allowed list a white list an unacceptable network site database an acceptable network site database a network site reputation database or the like of network access locations that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . Additionally the network access rules facility may incorporate rule evaluation the rule evaluation may parse network access requests and apply the parsed information to network access rules. The network access rule facility may have a generic set of rules that may be in support of an enterprise facility s network access policies such as denying access to certain types of websites controlling instant messenger accesses or the like. Rule evaluation may include regular expression rule evaluation or other rule evaluation method for interpreting the network access request and comparing the interpretation to the established rules for network access. In an embodiment the network access rules facility may receive a rules evaluation request from the network access control and may return the rules evaluation to the network access control.

Similar to the threat definitions facility the network access rule facility may provide updated rules and policies to the enterprise facility . The network access rules facility may be maintained by the network administration facility using network access rules facility management. In an embodiment the network administration facility may be able to maintain a set of access rules manually by adding rules changing rules deleting rules or the like. Additionally the administration facility may be able to retrieve predefined rule sets from a provider that may provide a set of rules to be applied to an entire enterprise facility . The network administration facility may be able to modify the predefined rules as needed for a particular enterprise facility using the network access rules management facility .

When a threat or policy violation is detected by the threat management facility the threat management facility may provide for a remedial action facility . Remedial action may take a plurality of forms such as terminating or modifying an ongoing process or interaction sending a warning to a client or administration facility of an ongoing process or interaction executing a program or application to remediate against a threat or violation record interactions for subsequent evaluation or the like. Remedial action may be associated with an application that responds to information that a client facility network access request has been denied. In an embodiment when the data file is received remedial action may parse the data file interpret the various aspects of the data file and act on the parsed data file information to determine actions to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment when the data file is received remedial action may access the threat definitions to parse the data file and determine an action to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment the information received from the facility may be a command or a command file. The remedial action facility may carry out any commands that are received or parsed from a data file from the facility without performing any interpretation of the commands. In an embodiment the remedial action facility may interact with the received information and may perform various actions on a client requesting access to a denied network location. The action may be one or more of continuing to block all requests to a denied network location a malicious code scan on the application a malicious code scan on the client facility quarantine of the application terminating the application isolation of the application isolation of the client facility to a location within the network that restricts network access blocking a network access port from a client facility reporting the application to a administration facility or the like.

Remedial action may be provided as a result of a detection of a threat or violation. The detection techniques facility may include monitoring the enterprise facility network or end point devices such as by monitoring streaming data through the gateway across the network through routers and hubs and the like. The detection techniques facility may include monitoring activity and stored files on computing facilities such as on server facilities desktop computers laptop computers other mobile computing devices and the like. Detection techniques such as scanning a computer s stored files may provide the capability of checking files for stored threats either in the active or passive state. Detection techniques such as streaming file management may provide the capability of checking files received at the network gateway facility client facility and the like. This may provide the capability of not allowing a streaming file or portions of the streaming file containing malicious code from entering the client facility gateway facility or network. In an embodiment the streaming file may be broken into blocks of information and a plurality of virus identities may be used to check each of the blocks of information for malicious code. In an embodiment any blocks that are not determined to be clear of malicious code may not be delivered to the client facility gateway facility or network.

Verifying that the threat management facility is detecting threats and violations to established policy may require the ability to test the system either at the system level or for a particular computing component. The testing facility may allow the administration facility to coordinate the testing of the security configurations of client facility computing facilities on a network. The administration facility may be able to send test files to a set of client facility computing facilities to test the ability of the client facility to determine acceptability of the test file. After the test file has been transmitted a recording facility may record the actions taken by the client facility in reaction to the test file. The recording facility may aggregate the testing information from the client facility and report the testing information to the administration facility . The administration facility may be able to determine the level of preparedness of the client facility computing facilities by the reported information. Remedial action may be taken for any of the client facility computing facilities as determined by the administration facility remedial action may be taken by the administration facility or by the user of the client facility .

The threat research facility may provide a continuously ongoing effort to maintain the threat protection capabilities of the threat management facility in light of continuous generation of new or evolved forms of malware. Threat research may include researchers and analysts working on known and emerging malware such as viruses rootkits a spyware as well as other computer threats such as phishing spam scams and the like. In embodiments through threat research the threat management facility may be able to provide swift global responses to the latest threats.

The threat management facility may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility where the enterprise facility may include a plurality of networked components such as client facility server facility administration facility firewall gateway hubs and routers threat management appliance desktop users mobile users and the like. In embodiments it may be the end point computer security facility located on a computer s desktop which may provide threat protection to a user and associated enterprise facility . In embodiments the term end point may refer to a computer system that may source data receive data evaluate data buffer data or the like such as a user s desktop computer as an end point computer a firewall as a data evaluation end point computer system a laptop as a mobile end point computer a PDA as a hand held end point computer a mobile phone as an end point computer or the like. In embodiments end point may refer to a source or destination for data including such components where the destination is characterized by an evaluation point for data and where the data may be sent to a subsequent destination after evaluation. The end point computer security facility may be an application loaded onto the computer platform or computer support component where the application may accommodate the plurality of computer platforms and or functional requirements of the component. For instance a client facility computer may be one of a plurality of computer platforms such as Windows Macintosh Linux and the like where the end point computer security facility may be adapted to the specific platform while maintaining a uniform product and product services across platforms. Additionally components may have different functions to serve within the enterprise facility s networked computer based infrastructure. For instance computer support components provided as hubs and routers server facility firewalls and the like may require unique security application software to protect their portion of the system infrastructure while providing an element in an integrated threat management system that extends out beyond the threat management facility to incorporate all computer resources under its protection.

The enterprise facility may include a plurality of client facility computing platforms on which the end point computer security facility is adapted. A client facility computing platform may be a computer system that is able to access a service on another computer such as a server facility via a network. This client facility server facility model may apply to a plurality of networked applications such as a client facility connecting to an enterprise facility application server facility a web browser client facility connecting to a web server facility an e mail client facility retrieving e mail from an internet service provider s mail storage servers and the like. In embodiments traditional large client facility applications may be switched to websites which may increase the browser s role as a client facility . Clients may be classified as a function of the extent to which they perform their own processing. For instance client facilities are sometimes classified as a fat client facility or thin client facility . The fat client facility also known as a thick client facility or rich client facility may be a client facility that performs the bulk of data processing operations itself and does not necessarily rely on the server facility . The fat client facility may be most common in the form of a personal computer where the personal computer may operate independent of any server facility . Programming environments for fat clients may include CURI Delphi Droplets Java win32 X11 and the like. Thin clients may offer minimal processing capabilities for instance the thin client facility may primarily provide a graphical user interface provided by an application server facility which may perform the bulk of any required data processing. Programming environments for thin clients may include JavaScript AJAX ASP JSP Ruby on Rails Python s Django PHP and the like. The client facility may also be a mix of the two such as processing data locally but relying on a server facility for data storage. As a result this hybrid client facility may provide benefits from both the fat client facility type such as multimedia support and high performance and the thin client facility type such as high manageability and flexibility. In embodiments the threat management facility and associated end point computer security facility may provide seamless threat protection to the plurality of clients and client facility types across the enterprise facility .

The enterprise facility may include a plurality of server facilities such as application servers communications servers file servers database servers proxy servers mail servers fax servers game servers web servers and the like. A server facility which may also be referred to as a server facility application server facility operating system server facility computer or the like may be an application program or operating system that accepts client facility connections in order to service requests from clients . The server facility application may run on the same computer as the client facility using it or the server facility and the client facility may be running on different computers and communicating across the network. Server facility applications may be divided among server facility computers with the dividing depending upon the workload. For instance under light load conditions all server facility applications may run on a single computer and under heavy load conditions a single server facility application may run on multiple computers. In embodiments the threat management facility may provide threat protection to server facilities within the enterprise facility as load conditions and application changes are made.

A server facility may also be an appliance facility where the appliance facility provides specific services onto the network. Though the appliance facility is a server facility computer that may be loaded with a server facility operating system and server facility application the enterprise facility user may not need to configure it as the configuration may have been performed by a third party. In an embodiment an enterprise facility appliance may be a server facility appliance that has been configured and adapted for use with the threat management facility and located within the facilities of the enterprise facility . The enterprise facility s threat management appliance may enable the enterprise facility to administer an on site local managed threat protection configuration where the administration facility may access the threat resources through an interface such as a web portal. In an alternate embodiment the enterprise facility may be managed remotely from a third party vendor or the like without an appliance facility located within the enterprise facility . In this instance the appliance functionality may be a shared hardware product between pluralities of enterprises . In embodiments the appliance facility may be located at the enterprise facility where the enterprise facility maintains a degree of control. In embodiments a hosted service may be provided where the appliance may still be an on site black box to the enterprise facility physically placed there because of infrastructure requirements but managed by a third party vendor or the like.

Simple server facility appliances may also be utilized across the enterprise facility s network infrastructure such as switches routers wireless routers hubs and routers gateways print servers net modems and the like. These simple server facility appliances may not require configuration by the enterprise facility but may require protection from threats via an end point computer security facility . These appliances may provide interconnection services within the enterprise facility network and therefore may advance the spread of a threat if not properly protected.

One way for a client facility to be protected from threats from within the enterprise facility network may be a personal firewall. A personal firewall may be an application that controls network traffic to and from a client permitting or denying communications based on a security policy. Personal firewalls may be designed for use by end users which may result in protection for only the computer on which it s installed. Personal firewalls may be able to control network traffic by providing prompts each time a connection is attempted and adapting security policy accordingly. Personal firewalls may also provide some level of intrusion detection which may allow the software to terminate or block connectivity where it suspects an intrusion is being attempted. Other features that may be provided by a personal firewall may include alerts about outgoing connection attempts control of program access to networks hiding the client from port scans by not responding to unsolicited network traffic monitoring of applications that may be listening for incoming connections monitoring and regulation of incoming and outgoing network traffic prevention of unwanted network traffic from installed applications reporting applications that make connection attempts reporting destination servers with which applications may be attempting communications and the like. In embodiments the personal firewall may be provided by the threat management facility .

Another important component that may be protected by an end point computer security facility is a network firewall facility which may be a hardware or software device that may be configured to permit deny or proxy data through a computer network that has different levels of trust in its source of data. For instance an internal enterprise facility network may have a high level of trust because the source of all data has been sourced from within the enterprise facility . An example of a low level of trust is the Internet because the source of data may be unknown. A zone with an intermediate trust level situated between the Internet and a trusted internal network may be referred to as a perimeter network . Since firewall facilities represent boundaries between threat levels the end point computer security facility associated with the firewall facility may provide resources that may control the flow of threats at this enterprise facility network entry point. Firewall facilities and associated end point computer security facility may also be associated with a network node that may be equipped for interfacing between networks that use different protocols. In embodiments the end point computer security facility may provide threat protection in a plurality of network infrastructure locations such as at the enterprise facility network entry point i.e. the firewall facility or gateway at the server facility at distribution points within the network i.e. the hubs and routers at the desktop of client facility computers and the like. In embodiments the most effective location for threat detection may be at the user s computer desktop end point computer security facility .

The interface between the threat management facility and the enterprise facility and through the appliance facility to embedded end point computer security facilities may include a set of tools that may be the same for all enterprise implementations but allow each enterprise to implement different controls. In embodiments these controls may include both automatic actions and managed actions. Automatic actions may include downloads of the end point computer security facility to components of the enterprise facility downloads of updates to existing end point computer security facilities of the enterprise facility uploaded network interaction requests from enterprise facility components to the threat management facility and the like. In embodiments automatic interactions between the enterprise facility and the threat management facility may be configured by the threat management facility and an administration facility in the enterprise facility . The administration facility may configure policy rules that determine interactions such as developing rules for accessing applications as in who is authorized and when applications may be used establishing rules for ethical behavior and activities rules governing the use of entertainment software such as games or personal use software such as IM and VoIP rules for determining access to enterprise facility computing resources including authentication levels of access risk assessment and usage history tracking rules for when an action is not allowed such as whether an action is completely deigned or just modified in its execution and the like. The administration facility may also establish license management which in turn may further determine interactions associated with a licensed application. In embodiments interactions between the threat management facility and the enterprise facility may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility by managing the flow of network data into and out of the enterprise facility through automatic actions that may be configured by the threat management facility or the administration facility .

Client facilities within the enterprise facility may be connected to the enterprise facility network by way of wired network facilities A or wireless network facilities B. Client facilities connected to the enterprise facility network via a wired facility A or wireless facility B may receive similar protection as both connection types are ultimately connected to the same enterprise facility network with the same end point computer security facility and the same threat protected enterprise facility environment. Mobile wireless facility clients B F because of their ability to connect to any wireless B D network access point may connect to the internet outside the enterprise facility and therefore outside the threat protected environment of the enterprise facility . In this instance the mobile client facility B F if not for the presence of the end point computer security facility may experience a malware attack or perform actions counter to enterprise facility established policies. In addition there may be a plurality of ways for the threat management facility to protect the out of enterprise facility mobile client facility D F that has an embedded end point computer security facility such as by providing URI filtering in personal routers using a web appliance as a DNS proxy or the like. Mobile client facilities D F that are components of the enterprise facility but temporarily outside connectivity with the enterprise facility network may be provided with the same threat protection and policy control as client facilities inside the enterprise facility . In addition mobile client facilities B F may receive the same interactions to and from the threat management facility as client facilities inside the enterprise facility where mobile client facilities B F may be considered a virtual extension of the enterprise facility receiving all the same services via their embedded end point computer security facility .

Interactions between the threat management facility and the components of the enterprise facility including mobile client facility B F extensions of the enterprise facility may ultimately be connected through the internet . Threat management facility downloads and upgrades to the enterprise facility may be passed from the firewalled networks of the threat management facility through to the end point computer security facility equipped components of the enterprise facility . In turn the end point computer security facility components of the enterprise facility may upload policy and access requests back across the internet and through to the threat management facility . The Internet however is also the path through which threats may be transmitted from their source. These network threats may include threats from a plurality of sources including websites e mail IM VoIP application software and the like. These threats may attempt to attack a mobile enterprise client facility B F equipped with an end point computer security facility but in embodiments as long as the mobile client facility B F is embedded with an end point computer security facility as described above threats may have no better success than if the mobile client facility B F were inside the enterprise facility .

However if the mobile client facility were to attempt to connect into an unprotected connection point such as at a secondary location that is not a part of the enterprise facility the mobile client facility may be required to request network interactions through the threat management facility where contacting the threat management facility may be performed prior to any other network action. In embodiments the client facility s end point computer security facility may manage actions in unprotected network environments such as when the client facility F is in a secondary location or connecting wirelessly to a non enterprise facility wireless internet connection where the end point computer security facility may dictate what actions are allowed blocked modified or the like. For instance if the client facility s end point computer security facility is unable to establish a secured connection to the threat management facility the end point computer security facility may inform the user of such and recommend that the connection not be made. In the instance when the user chooses to connect despite the recommendation the end point computer security facility may perform specific actions during or after the unprotected connection is made including running scans during the connection period running scans after the connection is terminated storing interactions for subsequent threat and policy evaluation contacting the threat management facility upon first instance of a secured connection for further actions and or scanning restricting access to network and local resources or the like. In embodiments the end point computer security facility may perform specific actions to remediate possible threat incursions or policy violations during or after the unprotected connection.

The secondary location may have no end point computer security facilities as a part of its computer components such as its firewalls B servers B clients G hubs and routers C D and the like. As a result the computer components of the secondary location may be open to threat attacks and become potential sources of threats as well as any mobile enterprise facility clients B F that may be connected to the secondary location s network. In this instance these computer components may now unknowingly spread a threat to other components connected to the network.

Some threats may not come directly from the Internet such as from non enterprise facility controlled mobile devices that are physically brought into the enterprise facility and connected to the enterprise facility client facilities . The connection may be made from direct connection with the enterprise facility s client facility such as through a USB port or in physical proximity with the enterprise facility s client facility such that a wireless facility connection can be established such as through a Bluetooth connection. These physical proximity threats may be another mobile computing device a portable memory storage device a mobile communications device or the like such as CDs and DVDs memory stick flash drive external hard drive cell phone PDAs MP3 players digital cameras point to point devices digital picture frames digital pens navigation devices appliances and the like. A physical proximity threat may have been previously infiltrated by network threats while connected to an unprotected network connection outside the enterprise facility and when connected to the enterprise facility client facility pose a threat. Because of their mobile nature physical proximity threats may infiltrate computing resources in any location such as being physically brought into the enterprise facility site connected to an enterprise facility client facility while that client facility is mobile plugged into an unprotected client facility at a secondary location and the like. A mobile device once connected to an unprotected computer resource may become a physical proximity threat . In embodiments the end point computer security facility may provide enterprise facility computing resources with threat protection against physical proximity threats for instance through scanning the device prior to allowing data transfers through security validation certificates through establishing a safe zone within the enterprise facility computing resource to transfer data into for evaluation and the like.

Now that the overall system has been described we turn towards an extensible file based security system that may be used to determine an appropriate application application environment and or access or security control measure based at least in part on using an application controller program to evaluate a file s reputation information. It should be understood that the following embodiments may be managed through a threat management facility along with other services such as those described herein.

In embodiments of the present invention a framework for an extensible file based security system may be used to determine an appropriate application application environment and or access or security control measure based at least in part on a file s reputation. A file s reputation may be recorded and stored at least in part in metadata. Metadata may define access and security parameters or some other parameter of a file. The access security or other parameters recorded in the metadata may conform to and or implement a corporate policy. The metadata may be stored in association with the file appended to the file linked to the file in a database or plurality of databases including a remote database or plurality of databases or otherwise encoded to relate to the file in such a manner that the metadata and its related file may be read together or near simultaneously. The metadata may be used to control the access and security settings of the file and to require that only an approved method of gaining access to the file or any of the file s contents is used and that the method and use of the file is in accord with the access and security parameter definitions in the metadata which embody the corporate policy.

In embodiments in response to the selection of a file an application controller may be used to select a software application from two or more software applications to open the selected file based at least in part on the selected file s reputation. If launched a software application may be configured to open the file in an environment such as a virtual machine quarantined environment and the like that is appropriate for the file based at least in part on the reputation information that is associated with the file. In embodiments a software application may be a secure software application configured to manage secure files or an insecure software application configured to manage insecure files. The software application may be selected and may launch a selected file based at least in part on the reputation information that is associated with the file. The selected file and communications relating to the selected application may be managed according to the selected software application s secure or insecure configuration.

Referring to in embodiments of the present invention an application controller software program may be used to select a software application to launch a file and to select an appropriate environment or virtual environment in which to launch the software application. The application controller may be associated with a plurality of machines A B including virtual machines in which a file A B C may be launched. The application controller may identify store update modify create read or otherwise manipulate reputation information that is associated with the file e.g. reputation metadata . The reputation information may be stored within the application controller or remotely stored in a database independent of the application controller but which is accessible by the application controller and or stored in the file s metadata store if that is part of the format of the file or facility of the operating system to store metadata associated with the file. The application controller may manage evaluate analyze read and store network communications that are associated with an application e.g. A A B B . Communications may include but are not limited to network access communications file access communications process access communications memory access communications device communications e.g. USB memory stick or some other type of communication. In embodiments the reputation information that is associated with a file may be metadata relating to the file format of the selected file the originating location of the selected file e.g. an Internet URL a location on an intranet a server address an IP address a UDP address a memory location a disk drive a folder path a CPU a plurality of locations etc. one or more prior locations where the selected file was previously located or some other type of reputation information. Reputation information may be metadata relating to an application that may be used to open the file .

In embodiments in response to an attempted access of a selected file the application controller may select a software application from at least two software applications A B A B to open the selected file based on the selected file s reputation. The at least two software applications A B A B may be configured to open the file if launched wherein one of the at least two software applications A B A B is a secure software application A A or B configured to manage secure files and one of the at least two software applications A B A B is an insecure software application A or B configured to manage insecure files. Following the selection of an appropriate software application to use to open the file the selected software application may be launched in order to open the selected file. The secure application A or B and or insecure application A or B may be launched in a first machine A a second machine B or a plurality of machines including but not limited to virtual machines machines running in a quarantined environment machines running with restricted operational privileges and capabilities and the like. The application controller may be used to manage the selected file and all communications relating to an application e.g. A A B B in accordance with the selected software application s secure or insecure configuration. Communications may include but are not limited to network access communications file access communications process access communications memory access communications USB device or some other type of communication device.

In embodiments in response to an attempted access of a selected file the application controller may select a software application from at least two software applications A B A B to open the selected file based on the selected file s reputation. The at least two software applications A B A B may be configured to open the file if launched wherein one of the at least two software applications A B A B is a secure software application A or B configured to manage secure files and one of the at least two software applications A B A B is an insecure software application A or B configured to manage insecure files. Following the selection of an appropriate software application to use to open the file the selected software application may be launched in order to open the selected file. The secure application A or B and or insecure application A or B may be launched in a first machine A a second machine B or a plurality of machines including but not limited to virtual machines machines running in a quarantined environment machines running with restricted operational privileges and capabilities and the like. The application controller may enable the selected application to further associate reputation information with the selected file such that the selected file is maintained in a condition that directs how it should be treated in the future. This may include but is not limited to updating recording and or storing reputation metadata and associating the metadata with the file . In another example embodiment the application controller may cause the selected application to associate similar reputation information as that for the selected file with a second file that is interacted with during the launch of the selected software application or any file the application modifies or creates.

Still referring to in embodiments an application controller may execute on a machine e.g. a server a desktop virtual machine or some other computer facility . The application controller may be associated with one or more applications such as but not limited to Word Internet Explorer iTunes Acrobat Reader Yahoo Messenger or some other software application. The machine may be able to access one or more resources. A resource may be access to the Internet access to one or more intranets access one or more CPUs one or more disk drives one or more hard drives system resources network resources machine resources or other resources. Resources may include but are not limited to another application e.g. a server application . Resources may be areas of a local file system areas of a registry internal objects e.g. COM objects portions of a network Internet or intranet or some other type of resource. The machine may access one or more files through one or more such resources. For example a machine may download a file from the Internet and store the file to a hard drive attached to the machine . In another example a machine may access a file stored on a network drive. In embodiments an application may be run in virtual environment for example on a virtual machine or some other virtual environment. In embodiments the virtual environment may be utilized to control access to one or more resources accessible by the machine . In some embodiments the application controller may control application instances. In example embodiments the application controller may control separate application windows the application controller may control both application instances and separate application windows the application controller may control the operating system the application controller may control other execution environments.

In embodiments an application controller may determine an appropriate application to access a selected file based on a reputation associated with the selected file . For example the application controller may determine to run a selected file in a secure application . Alternatively the application controller may determine to run a selected file in an insecure application . In embodiments a user may define one or more rules for directing the application controller . Rules may for example derive from a corporate policy regarding software file usage. For example a user may define a rule directing the application controller to open text files selected from the Internet in Wordpad that is operating as a secure application . In embodiments one or more applications may be cached locally on the machine as an optimization.

In embodiments the application controller may determine to run a secure application because the application controller determines that the selected file has no reputation or only partially complete reputation metadata. In some embodiments the application controller may determine to run a secure application because the application controller determines that the reputation indicates that the selected file is from an insecure zone such as but not limited to the Internet an unknown device another machine a thumb drive or some other insecure location. The application controller may determine to run a secure application because the application controller determines that the reputation indicates the selected file is not from a trusted source such as but not limited to a trusted user a trusted intranet a trusted group a trusted machine or some other source such as a trusted application.

In embodiments the secure application may have limited access to resources available on the machine . The secure application may not be able to access resources such as but not limited to network drives the Internet other machines and other resources. For example the application controller may run a selected file with an unsafe reputation in a secure application that only has access to the machine CPU and RAM but not any drives on the machine nor the Internet . In another example the application controller may run a secure application with access to the Internet but without access to any other resources other than those required to run the secure application . In another example the application controller may run a secure application with access to an internal business server with access to additional system resources but without access to the Internet .

In some embodiments the application controller may determine to run an insecure application because the application controller determines that the selected file is secure. In some embodiments the insecure application may have access to resources available on the machine . In some embodiments the insecure application may have no restrictions on the resources available to the machine . In some embodiments the insecure application may access the same resources available to the user of the machine . In embodiments the application controller may determine to run an application in a mode other than secure or insecure. Such other mode may be a customized mode a test mode or some other mode. A customized mode may be defined by a user a machine administrator a system administrator or some other entity that can define a mode. A test mode for example may start as a secure application and escalate to an insecure application by granting the application access to additional resources. As another example an application may start as an insecure application and change to a secure application upon the application controller determining that there is a threat in the file . In embodiments there may be multiple definitions of secure and insecure modes depending on policy which may be tied to reputation information.

In embodiments the application controller may protect data by using a reputation to contain threats and prevent data leaks. In some embodiments the application controller may detect attempted data transfers from an insecure application to a secure application intercept the transfers and clean the insecure data. For example the application controller may detect a transfer of data from a file run in an insecure application intercept the transfer and execute a cleaning action e.g. quarantine virus infections quarantine malware remove confidential information etc. on the data to be transferred into the secure application . In some embodiments the application controller may protect against threats e.g. malware viruses adware etc. prevent data leaks by updating a selected file s reputation with a danger flag or other alert.

As depicted in for example the application controller associated with the machine A may run a file C from the Internet in a secure application A where the reputation indicates that the file C is from an unknown source. The application control associated with the machine B may also run the file C in a secure application B for the same reason. The application controllers A B may run the file B from the intranet in secure applications A B to prevent the data in B from being leaked to the Internet .

Referring to the application controller associated with a machine B may run a file in an insecure application and share the file with another machine A. that runs the same file in a second environment using a secure application A for example after the application controller has performed some action on the file rendering the file appropriate for running in a secure application environment. In embodiments the application controller may run a file B from an intranet in an insecure application B and may share the file B with a second unprotected machine A where the file B has a reputation indicating permission for external use. For example an application controller may run an intranet file B relating to a press release in an insecure application B so that the press release may be posted on the Internet .

Referring to a machine without an application controller such as an unmanaged machine or a machine lacking a designation within the system may not access file reputations. For example an unmanaged machine without an application controller may not be able to determine which files are from the Internet A or from an intranet B all files accessed by such machine A may be designated to be of unknown origin and may be required to be opened only by an insecure application B.

Referring to an application controller may be used to protect against damage from unknown malware such as that coming to a system from the internet or malware that has its origin within an intranet. As disclosed herein in embodiments an application controller may run a selected file in an insecure application B with restricted access to resources. For example a day zero malware file may be received by both a machine A without an application controller and a machine B with an application controller. For machine A protection provided by existing systems would not be able to detect the day zero malware A and the insecure application A will run the application without additional protections. For machine B the application controller may also run the day zero malware file A in an insecure application B. However the application controller may run the insecure application B without access to other resources e.g. run in a separate virtual environment run in a sandbox environment run without access to some sensitive resources or run in some other protected manner and protect machine B from the malware threat. Other files may also be protected from the threat because the application will not have access to the files. Additionally the application controller may update the reputation for the zero day malware A to identify the threat.

Referring to in embodiments an application controller may run on a single machine and or computing environment consisting of a single machine. For example a home user may run the application controller on his home computer laptop or some other client device fully enabled with the features of the application controller as described elsewhere herein. In an example embodiment a policy may be created that allows businesses applications secure only to be used to access business files and allow a user s home applications to only be used to access non business files.

Referring to in embodiments a file from a secure application A may be encrypted to restrict access to the file . For example a file from an intranet may be encrypted by a secure application A and access only granted to the file through another secure application B with the necessary decryption key. In another example a file from the Internet may be encrypted by a secure application A and access only granted to the file through another secure application B with the necessary decryption key. In some embodiments an unmanaged machine may not be able to decrypt such encrypted files .
