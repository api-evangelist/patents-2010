In this manner portable fitness device may gather information regarding athlete such as his her heart rate and body temperature and if the athlete s shoes are equipped with an RFID tag the shoes worn during the fitness activity. Portable fitness device may similarly present to the user performance directional and training information via watch and headphones .

Of course in alternative embodiments portable fitness device may sense or communicate with particular devices utilizing wired or wireless interfaces. For example microphone may alternatively be incorporated within wireless headphones and heart rate monitor may alternatively be coupled to CPU via a wired interface. Thus those skilled in the art will appreciate from the block diagram provided in that any number of internal or external devices and sensors such as temperature and barometric pressure sensor may be coupled to CPU via either wired or wireless interfaces. In this manner client software running on CPU may associate with the time and position information provided by GPS receiver various data of interest regarding athlete his her environment and the route being traversed. The data may be stored locally by portable fitness device for example within internal memory device or transmitted over the air by WAN wireless transceiver possibly in real time.

With reference now to there is illustrated a layer diagram of an exemplary software configuration of portable fitness device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated the software configuration of portable fitness device includes at a lowest level an operating system OS that provides a collection of services such as thread scheduling memory management interrupts etc. that may be accessed by higher level software. Running on top of operating system is a runtime environment such as one of the JAVA or BREW runtime environments. Finally the software configuration of portable fitness device includes a portable fitness device client running on top of runtime environment . Portable fitness device client may be downloaded to portable fitness device over the air for example via the wireless WAN and WAN wireless transceiver .

As illustrated portable fitness device client comprises a number of individual modules each performing a function of portable fitness device . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the illustrated modules are illustrative rather than exhaustive and that portable fitness device client may include additional or alternative modules to support or extend the functionality of portable fitness device .

As shown in the modules within portable fitness device client preferably include a number of reader modules . GPS reader receives from GPS receiver time stamped waypoints including at least time latitude and longitude information and depending upon implementation and the number of GPS satellites from which GPS signals were received elevation and error information. Utilizing the time stamped waypoints received from GPS receiver GPS reader calculates performance and route information for athlete . For example GPS reader may determines the start time at which a route was begun an elapsed time an elapsed distance distance remaining in the route elevation change average elevation current pace average pace bearing etc.

The remainder of readers for example heart rate reader and annotation reader similarly obtain input data and associate the input data with a corresponding time stamped waypoint obtained by GPS reader . Readers may also perform additional calculations to determine instantaneous differential or cumulative quantitative characterizations of the route the performance of athlete or of his her environment. Thus for example heart rate reader may obtain an instantaneous heart rate reading from heart rate monitor associate that heart rate reading with the time stamped waypoint obtained by GPS reader and calculate an average heart rate. Similarly annotation reader may store a route annotation entered by athlete via input buttons or microphone with a time stamped waypoint obtained by GPS reader .

The data gathered and calculated by readers are then parsed and formatted by formatter into a predetermined data format that associates the performance and route data with a timestamp and geographical location. The particular data format employed by data formatter is implementation dependent but is preferably compact to conserve the capacity of internal memory device and the bandwidth of the communication link between portable training device and the wireless WAN. Storage capacity and wireless communication bandwidth may further be conserved by applying a data compressor to the formatted data produced by data formatter .

After data obtained and calculated by readers have been formatted by data formatter and optionally compressed by data compressor the data are either stored within internal memory device or audio storage or a removal memory loaded in removable memory slot or are transmitted over the air via WAN wireless transceiver . Upload manager and route and performance recorder determine whether or not to upload and or store data locally based upon one or more criteria for example whether WAN wireless transceiver can acquire a connection to the wireless WAN the available storage within internal memory device an indication of whether or not a remote user is tracking the training of athlete in real time and or other criteria. If based upon these and or other criteria upload manager decides to upload the formatted and compressed data upload manager outputs the data via WAN wireless transceiver and antenna to client computer system and or server computer system utilizing radio frequency signals . Data transmitted to client computer system is typically graphically presented within a display device and data transmitted to server computer system is typically stored within training journal database .

As noted above portable training device may alternatively receive data over the air from the wireless WAN. In a preferred embodiment the data received over the air from the wireless WAN may include route information transmitted by server computer system from route database settings of portable fitness device transmitted by server computer system or client computer system and training recommendations transmitted from server computer system or client computer system . Route information which may be identified as such for example by an XML header is received processed and stored by route storage manager . The route information may be for example turn by turn directions keyed to particular geographical areas defined by a latitude and longitude range duple. By storing route information in this format when GPS reader obtains a time stamped waypoint falling within a particular geographic area defined by a latitude and longitude range duple audio presentation module can present an audible instruction to athlete via speaker and or headphones to direct athlete how to traverse a desired route.

Settings data which may be identified as such for example by an XML header is initially received processed and output by data decompressor is then subsequently processed by settings manager . For example settings manager may utilize settings data to update storage locations within internal memory device governing particular aspects of the operation of portable training device . In addition based upon the received settings settings manager may notify upload manager or route and performance recorder to initiate upload or storage of route and performance information.

Training recommendations received processed and output by data decompressor are subsequently processed by training input manager . These training recommendations preferably take the form of either voice data communicated by a human trainer utilizing for example a voice over IP VoIP connection to portable training device or a predetermined data command representing an audio message. In the former case training input manager exports the audio data directly to audio presentation module which in turn directly presents the audio data to athlete via headphones and or speaker . If however the training recommendation takes the form of a data command representing an audio message training input manager locates an audio track within audio storage or internal memory device corresponding to the data command and presents the audio track to audio presentation module for subsequent presentation to athlete . In this manner a remote trainer who may be stationed at client computer system may provide training recommendations directly to athlete in substantially real time. And if portable training device is equipped with a microphone athlete may similarly communicate audibly with the remote trainer e.g. via VoIP through the execution of annotation reader data formatter data compressor and upload manager .

Audio presentation module is also preferably equipped to present in audio format turn by turn directions correcting the course of an athlete to return to a route if a turn is missed as well as turn by turn directions providing the most direct return path to the starting point. Such turn by turn directions are preferably computed by server computer system based upon real time location information received over the air from portable fitness device and then transmitted to portable fitness device again utilizing over the air communication via the wireless WAN. Audio presentation module may also be utilized to decode and present audio entertainment tracks such as the MP3 files stored within audio storage .

As further depicted in portable fitness device client includes a visual presentation module that manages the presentation of route performance and environmental information to athlete via optional display and or the display of watch . It should be noted however that it is presently preferred to present data of all types to athlete during the course of a fitness activity in audio format so that the concentration and attention of athlete is not diverted from training efforts.

Finally route publication manager of portable fitness device client supports the sharing of routes between multiple portable fitness devices for example utilizing the local wireless interface WAN wireless transceiver or data port . In this manner an athlete can directly share selected routes e.g. as identified utilizing input buttons to other athletes having compatible portable fitness devices .

Referring now to there is depicted a layer diagram of an exemplary software configuration of server computer system of that in accordance with the present invention provides an automated web based route generation route journaling and route visualization service. The service may be restricted to users that have been issued login IDs and passwords and may further be offered in exchange for a subscription fee.

As shown at the lowest layer the software configuration of server computer system includes an operating system OS which is preferably one of the commercially available operating systems such as Windows UNIX LINUX AIX etc. OS has an associated application programming interface API though which middleware and application programs may access the services of OS .

Running on top of OS is a hypertext transport protocol HTTP server which as is well known in the art communicates data over Internet utilizing HTTP. In particular HTTP server supports data communication with portable fitness device and one or more remote client computers utilizing HTTP. Communication with server computer system may alternatively or additionally be conducted utilizing a sockets layer interface or other lower layer protocol running over IP.

In addition to HTTP server the application software of server computer system includes a number of different modules supporting the client side functionality provided by portable fitness device client . In the depicted embodiment these modules include a route generation and publication module a data recorder module and a visualization module . Those skilled in the art will again appreciate that alternative or additional modules may be implemented within server computer system in order to provide or extend the described or additional functionality.

Route generation and publication module generates routes to be traversed by athletes during fitness activities stores the routes within route database for subsequent access and downloads the routes to portable fitness devices . In a preferred embodiment route generation and publication module includes a route wizard which as described below with respect to guides a user through a step by step process for generating routes having desired parameters and attributes. As shown in route generation and publication module preferably accesses a local or remote map database that stores street and or trail information in association with at least latitude and longitude information and preferably elevation information. Thus given at least one terminal point e.g. a starting point route generation and publication module is able to construct one or more routes having a desired length elevation profile and other parameters and attributes. Routes generated by route generation and publication module are stored for subsequent access within route database .

Once a particular route is scheduled by an athlete as discussed further below route generation and publication module transforms the route into a sequence of turn by turn instructions and publishes the route to a portable fitness device via HTTP server and the wireless WAN. Because route generation and publication module can obtain elevation information along a desired route directly from map database route generation and publication module is also able to advantageously supply in conjunction with a route elevation information for the route. In this manner the elevation information supplied by route generation and publication module can assist or replace the elevation information provided by GPS receiver . Thus if less than four GPS satellites are acquired or if GPS receiver is not designed to process elevation information portable fitness device can still determine elevation dependent route and performance data regarding a route traversed by athlete .

Data recorder module receives route and performance information from portable training device via the wireless WAN and or local wireless interface and or data port and utilizes such data to build a virtual training journal for athlete within training journal database . As noted previously depending upon the operation of the upload manager and route and performance recorder within portable fitness device client data recorder module can build a journal entry describing the traversal of a particular route in substantially real time i.e. during traversal of the route . Data recorder module also preferably supports an interface through which a route recorded by data recorder module can be exported to route database for subsequent viewing selection and scheduling within a user s training journal.

The exemplary software configuration of server computer system finally includes visualization module . Visualization module supports one or more interfaces through which users of remote client computer systems can view and or annotate the data recorded within training journal database by data recorder module . In the depicted embodiment visualization module includes training journal interface which as described in detail below permits an athlete to view and or annotate a journal entry describing a route traversed during a fitness activity after completion of the route traversal. In a preferred embodiment visualization module further includes a real time interface through which a user at a remote client computer system may view in substantially real time data logged within training journal database for one or more athletes. Thus for example a spectator having access to Internet can view the real time standings of multiple competitors in a fitness activity such as a marathon cycling race or other competitive event. Similarly a remotely located trainer having access to Internet via a client computer can view the progress of one or more athletes engaged in one or more training activities in substantially real time.

Visualization module also preferably includes support for the export of selected journal entries between accounts of different users of the back end service provided by server computer system . For example visualization module preferably permits a user to transmit a journal entry representing a traversal of a route via email. In addition visualization module may permit a user to create a buddy account that may be accessed and even annotated by guest users. In this manner if the services provided by server computer system are provided for a subscription fee marketing of the service is enhanced by the ability of non subscribers or subscriber having reduced cost subscriptions to view journal entries created by exercise partners.

Referring now to there are illustrated a sequence of graphical user interface GUI windows presented by route wizard to a user of client computer system by HTTP server .

The user may interact with route map in a number of ways. For example the user may annotate route map by dragging any of icons to a selected location along route path utilizing cursor . For example in the illustrated embodiment the user is dragging an annotation representing a potable water source onto route map . The user may alternatively drag callout box icon onto route map in order to enter a textual annotation.

In addition in response to clicking on route path utilizing cursor training journal interface displays one or more markers along route path preferably in association with one or more items of route or performance information e.g. a distance for the geographical location identified by the marker . By adding markers in this manner the user can graphically and intuitively ascertain the geographical location of features of interest and performance and route information at selected locations along route path . Training journal interface may alternatively or additionally present route and performance information for a selected geographical location in response to the user causing cursor to fly over the corresponding location on route path .

In association with route map training journal interface preferably presents other performance information route information and or environmental information in graphical format. For example in the depicted embodiment training journal interface presents an elevation profile a heart rate profile and a pace profile in association with route map . When the user adds markers to route path training journal interface automatically presents corresponding markers and at corresponding locations along graphical profiles . As discussed above all of markers and all of markers are synchronized so that movement of any of markers moves all of markers movement of any of markers moves all of markers . In this manner the user is able to graphically and intuitively define an interval over which performance route and or environmental information may be viewed. For example in the depicted embodiment interval information is depicted in interval section which informs the user of the interval distance time taken by the athlete to traverse the route interval average pace over the route interval and average heart rate over the route interval.

Of course the particular types of route performance and environmental information shown in are not exhaustive and other types of route performance and environmental information may be captured in association with the traversal of a route. If additional route performance or environmental information is captured in association with the route that information is preferably presented in a profile within interval section and or within overall performance section in like manner. For example GUI window may present information regarding what pair of shoes the athlete was wearing during the fitness activity together with a lifetime mileage total for that specific pair of shoes .

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user may alternatively or additionally view route performance and environmental information regarding a previously traversed route in an overlay view in which a graphical representation of the route performance and or environmental information is depicted along route path . For example in the illustrated embodiment in response to user selection of overlay view button utilizing cursor training journal interface presents route map of in place of route map of .

Like route map route map includes terminal points and defining the starting and ending points of a route path . In contrast to route map however route path of route map comprises a plurality of bands each of which represents a respective route performance or environmental parameter quantified at the waypoints recorded along the route. The value of the respective route performance or environmental parameter is preferably charted along route path utilizing gray scale or color shade variation to represent the instantaneous quantity of the route performance or environmental parameter at each point along the route. Thus in the different hatching applied to each of bands represents a different color and a varying spacing between the hatches represents the display of the colors at varying levels of intensity along the route path depending upon the value of the parameters at each point along the path. The value associated with each shade of color or each level of gray scale is generally graphically represented in an accompanying legend . Training journal interface preferably further presents instantaneous route and performance data at any point along the route path in response to a flyover of cursor or in response to the user adding markers to the route path as described above. For example in association with the display of marker training journal interface displays information regarding the traversed distance relative elevation heart rate and pace associated with a distance 1.4 miles from the beginning of the route.

Returning to in addition to supporting user annotation of route maps and GUI window preferably permits the user to enter additional information regarding environmental and route conditions and personal thoughts. For example GUI window includes a route condition section that permits the user to record the surface and traffic conditions observed along the route as well as a text box in which the user may enter personal reflections about the training activity.

Finally GUI window preferably includes a GUI component that permits the user to review and or rate the route. For example in the exemplary embodiment GUI window contains a second text box in which the user can compose a review of the route and a ratings section in which the user can award the route between one and four stars . After the route has been reviewed and or rated the user can select Publish button which causes training journal interface to store the review and rating within route database in association with the route. In this manner the review and rating are available for access by other users through route wizard as described above.

Training journal interface preferably permits a user to view prospective routes that have been scheduled utilizing a similar interface to that illustrated in . In particular in response to a user selecting a journal entry for a future date within list box of training journal interface presents a journal entry containing a route map of the prospective training activity as shown in . Of course the journal entry will not contain any performance information e.g. time pace heart rate etc. because the athlete has not yet traversed the route.

Training journal interface also preferably permits a user to view routes currently being traversed in substantially real time through an interface similar to that depicted in . In this case training journal interface presents a journal entry containing a route map and a marker showing the athlete s current location with respect to route path . In addition training journal interface may present a summary section summarizing the athlete s performance to the current position a weather condition section an interval section and one or more graphical profiles . In this manner a remote trainer or spectator stationed at a client computer system may track an athlete s performance information route information and environmental information in substantially real time.

If a user stationed at a client computer system desires to view a substantially real time view of the activities of multiple athletes traversing a common route the user preferably logs into real time interface through HTTP server . Assuming the user has the appropriate subscription and or permissions real time interface builds from the training journals of multiple athletes a web page containing a single route map on which multiple markers each representing a respective athlete are presented. The web page may further present separate performance and route information for each athlete. In this manner a remote trainer or spectator stationed at a client computer system may track performance information route information and environmental information in substantially real time for multiple athletes traversing the same or substantially the same route.
