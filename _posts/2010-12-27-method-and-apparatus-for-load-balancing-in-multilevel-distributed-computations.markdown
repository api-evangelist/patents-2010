Mobile devices with various methods of connectivity are now for many people becoming the primary gateway to the internet and also a major storage point for personal information. This is in addition to the normal range of personal computers and furthermore sensor devices plus internet based providers. Combining these devices together and lately the applications and the information stored by those applications is a major challenge of interoperability. This can be achieved through numerous individual and personal information spaces in which persons groups of persons etc. can place share interact and manipulate or program devices to automatically perform the planning interaction and manipulation of webs of information with their own locally agreed semantics without necessarily conforming to an unobtainable global whole.

Furthermore in addition to information the information spaces may be combined with webs of shared and interactive computations or computation spaces so that the devices having connectivity to the computation spaces can have the information in the information space manipulated within the computation space environment and the results delivered to the device rather than the whole process being performed locally in the device. It is noted that such computation spaces may consist of connectivity between devices from devices to network infrastructure to distributed information spaces so that computations can be executed where enough computational elements are available. These combined information spaces and computation spaces often referred to as computation clouds are extensions of the Giant Global Graph in which one can apply semantics and reasoning at a local level.

In one example clouds are working spaces respectively embedded with distributed information and computation infrastructures spanned around computers information appliances processing devices and sensors that allow people to work efficiently through access to information and computations from computers or other devices. An information space or a computation space can be rendered by the computation devices physically presented as heterogeneous networks wired and wireless . However despite the fact that information and computation presented by the respective spaces can be distributed with different granularity still there are challenges in certain example implementations to achieve scalable high context information processing within such heterogeneous environments. For example in various implementations due to distributed nature of the cloud exchange of data information and computation elements e.g. computation closures among distributed devices involved in a cloud infrastructure may require excessive amount of resources e.g. process time process power storage space etc. . In various example circumstances to enhance the information processing power of a device and reduce the processing cost one might consider minimizing or at least significantly improving exchange of data information and computations among the distributed devices. In various example embodiments we can minimize or improve or significantly improve data migration within a computational architecture by providing multi level distributed computations such that the data can be migrated to the closest possible computation level with minimized or improved cost. However unbalanced distribution of computations within a computation architecture may cause congestions in parts of the architecture while there may be unused available resources in other parts of the architecture. Furthermore under certain conditions some of the resources within the architecture may become unavailable for example due to faults failures heavy transaction load etc.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for computation migration within a computational architecture such that the data can be migrated to the closest possible computation level with minimized or improved cost while factors such as resource availability congestion load etc. are taken in to account. In order to optimize the execution of computation closures factors such as load balancing status closure execution capabilities available at each part of the computational architecture functional flow specifications cost functions network communication rule etc. need to be detected identified and determined and the decision for distribution of closures for execution made based on the determined factors.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for providing load balancing in multi level distributed computations are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

As used herein the term computation closure identifies a particular computation procedure together with relations and communications among various processes including passing arguments sharing process results flow of data and process results etc. The computation closures e.g. a granular reflective set of instructions data and or related execution context or state provide the capability of slicing of computations for processes and transmitting the computation slices between devices infrastructures and information sources.

As used herein the term cloud refers to an aggregated set of information and computation closures from different sources. This multi sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework RDF RDF Schema RDFS OWL Web Ontology Language FOAF Friend of a Friend ontology rule sets in RuleML Rule Markup Language etc. Furthermore as used herein RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium W3C specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources using a variety of syntax formats. Although various embodiments are described with respect to clouds it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other structures and conceptual description methods used to create distributed models of information and computations.

The basic concept of cloud computing technology provides access to distributed computations for various devices within the scope of the cloud in such a way that the distributed nature of the computations is hidden from users and it appears to a user as if all the computations are performed on the same device. The cloud computing also enables a user to have control over computation distribution by transferring computations between devices that the user has access to. For example a user may want to transfer computations among work devices home devices and portable devices other private and public devices etc. Current technologies enable a user of a mobile device to manipulate contexts such as data and information via the elements of a user interface of their user equipment. However distribution of computations and processes related to or acting on the data and information within the cloud is typically controlled by the system. In other words a cloud in general does not provide a user e.g. an owner of a collection of information distributed over the information space with the ability to control distribution of related computations and processes of for instance applications acting on the information. For example a contact management application that processes contact information distributed within one or more clouds generally executes on a single device e.g. with all processes and computations of the application also executing on the same device to operate on the distributed information. In some cases e.g. when computations are complex the data set is large etc. providing a means to also distribute the related computations in addition to the information is advantageous.

This goal is achieved by introduction of the capability to construct distribute and aggregate computations as well as their related data. More specifically to enable a user of a cloud who connects to the cloud via one or more user devices to distribute computations among the one or more user devices or other devices with access to the cloud each computation is deconstructed to its basic or primitive processes or computation closures. Once a computation is divided into its primitive computation closures the processes within or represented by each closure may be executed in a distributed fashion and the processing results can be collected and aggregated into the result of the execution of the initial overall computation.

In one embodiment a computational architecture consists of a plurality of architectural levels including a device level and infrastructure level and a cloud computing level. A device from the device level has connectivity to the cloud computing level via one or more infrastructure levels wherein each infrastructure level may consist of layers and components such as backbones routers base stations etc. Typically the computation closures associated with a process related to a device from device level are defined constructed and executed within the cloud computing level which may have various levels of distribution as well. However the components of the infrastructure levels may be equipped with various resources e.g. processing environments storage spaces etc. that can be utilized for the execution of computation closures associated with a process. Since the infrastructure level functions as an interface between the device level and the cloud computing level if the computation closures can be executed in the infrastructure level there will be no need for the computation closures to be migrated to the cloud computing level that may very well require excessive use of resources. Therefore execution of computation closures associated with a process related to a device at the infrastructure level can provide services to device users in a more efficient manner. However resources such as processing environments storages etc. within the multi level architectural environment of device level infrastructure level and cloud level each may differ in configuration availability processing power storage volume communication capability etc. Because of this diversity load balancing and even distribution of workload across components of an architectural level or among different levels becomes a very critical issue.

To address this problem a system of introduces the capability to provide load balancing in multi level distributed computations. A computational architecture environment consists of different levels of proactive computational elements available for various levels of the architecture such as device level infrastructure level and cloud computing level. Since these computational elements provide various levels of functionality for each of the levels providing different levels of migration of the computational closures within the architecture enables the execution of the computational closures after the least required level of migration. However a very important functionality for optimizing execution of computational closures are to detect identify and determine load balancing including what closure capabilities are available at each part of the multi level computational levels and components and what is the efficient distribution of closures.

In one embodiment different components of each architectural level support different types of closures. Each component e.g. infrastructure component node may have a number of previously created entities closures and links for the computation of the closures such as connectors between closures multiple branches interaction points rules etc. Furthermore the computations can be requested to be transferred and or expanded from one component to another or from an architectural level to another e.g. from infrastructure to cloud 

In one embodiment a cloud may include a superset of closure elements e.g. closure primitives while the infrastructure or device level components may have subsets of and therefore the cloud may be capable of supporting computational closures more effectively compared to the infrastructure or device levels. In other embodiments computational closure packets can be expanded to proper components via load balancing.

In one embodiment device setup at various architectural levels such as battery consumption quality of service QOS settings class of service COS settings priority settings etc. may affect the direction and method of computational closure distribution as different setups may lead to different situations of resource availability. Additionally cost of load balancing can be indirectly affected by other features of architectural levels such as energy consumption strategies privacy settings security enforcements etc. On the other hand load balancing between different architectural levels and components can be achieved by different levels of computation migration.

In one embodiment certain amount of load balancing functionality can be transferred from device level to infrastructure level or further to cloud level depending on the available capabilities of each level. For example device level may be equipped with a high speed high capacity Radio Frequency RF memory tag which provides an additional component for device level computation. In this embodiment access to the RF memory tag may reduce the need for computation migration to other levels since the RF memory tag can be used as a resource for computations.

As shown in the system comprises a set of user equipments UEs having connectivity to distributed computation control platform via a communication network . By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network not shown a wireless network not shown a telephony network not shown or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UEs are any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

In one embodiment the UEs are respectively equipped with one or more user interfaces UI . Each UI may consist of several UI elements not shown at any time depending on the service that is being used. UI elements may be icons representing user contexts such as information e.g. music information contact information video information etc. functions e.g. setup search etc. and or processes e.g. download play edit save etc. . These contexts may require certain sets of media dependent computational closures which may affect the service for example the bit error rate etc. Additionally each UI element may be bound to a context process by granular migration. In one embodiment granular migration enables processes to be implicitly or explicitly migrated between devices computation clouds and other infrastructure.

In one embodiment process migration can be initiated for example by means of unicast e.g. to just another device or multicast e.g. to multiple other devices . For example one UE may communicate with many infrastructures or many components of many infrastructures while many nodes of infrastructures may communicate with multiple clouds. Additionally process migration may be triggered via gesture recognition wherein the user preselects a particular set of UI elements and makes a gesture to simulate pouring the selected UE elements from one device to another. In other embodiments process migration may be initiated automatically without direct user involvement and based on default setup by the manufacturer of the UE previous setup by the user of the UE default setup in an application activated on or associated with a UE or a combination thereof.

As seen in a user of UEs may own use or otherwise have access to various pieces of information and computations distributed over one or more computation clouds in information stores and computation stores where each of the one or more computation spaces include multiple sets of one or more computation closures.

In one embodiment the communication network consists of one or more infrastructures wherein each infrastructure is a designed communication system including multiple components . The components include backbones routers switches wireless access points access methods protocols etc. used for communication within the communication network or between communication network and other networks.

In one embodiment the distributed computation control platform controls the distribution of computations associated with UEs to other components or levels of the architecture including the infrastructure level within the environment of the communication network and the cloud level 

In one embodiment computation distribution control includes load balancing which may be initiated by the user or based on a background activity for example by triggering a sequence of computation closures which in turn support load balancing action. Prior to load balancing the capabilities available for performing the load balancing function are evaluated. If capabilities are not satisfactory or changes are found the evaluation process will be repeated until proper capabilities become available. The capabilities may be found in the same or other levels of the computational architecture and the computation closure execution will be performed at the level where available capabilities are found.

In another embodiment network components may provide different levels of functionality. For example some components may provide static computational closures while others may provide dynamic computational closures. As used herein static computational closures are closures with predetermined configurations while dynamic computational closures are closures that may function differently based on dynamic factors such as time traffic load type of available power resource etc. A dynamic computation closure may adjust itself based on the dynamic factor by modifying parameters such as the amount of reserved resources.

In one embodiment the amount and type of available computational closures at a component of the infrastructure may or may not be aligned with the required computation closures by UE through a one to one mapping. This means that the component may need to locate request further computational elements from current or next layer or level of the architecture. In other words if the computation closures between a process and its processing environment are not directly aligned the processing environment may expand its computation closures for dynamic closures or request additional computational closures from other components for static closures or a combination thereof. In one embodiment if neither the direct alignment succeeds nor additional closures found the setup may be aligned with lower computation requirements. The requirements may be lowered for example by dropping part of the computational components reducing media requirements e.g. reduction of multimedia to voice only or decreasing speed requirements . Additionally the satisfaction threshold may be lowered with service provider and user s agreement so that a lower level of load balancing setup can be considered as satisfactory.

In one embodiment the computational closures available in multiple levels of device level infrastructure level and cloud level are either aligned meaning that all the computational closures are available in every level or a super set of all computational closures is available at cloud level while each lower level has access to a sub set of the computational closures from its higher level for example infrastructure level computational closures may be a sub set of the closures of cloud level and device level closures a sub set of the infrastructure level closures.

By way of example the UE and the distributed computation control platform communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically affected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer header a data link layer header an internetwork layer header and a transport layer header and various application layer layer and layer headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

In one embodiment capability evaluator of the distributed computation control platform determines closure capability data associated with respective levels of a computational architecture wherein the respective levels include at least in part a device level a infrastructure level and a cloud computation level per step of . The determined capabilities can be utilized for deciding at which level each computation should be executed. In one embodiment the capability evaluator may determine closure capabilities following the start of process distribution. In other embodiments the capability evaluator may periodically e.g. based on an initial setup determine closure capability data associated with different levels of the architecture store the determined data in storage in information stores of clouds or a combination thereof and retrieve reuse the stored data when needed. The capability evaluator may determine and store the closure capabilities in Resource Description Framework RDF format. In one embodiment if the determined capabilities are unsatisfactory the required capabilities are not met the capability evaluator may continue evaluating other components e.g. devices infrastructure nodes clouds until the proper capabilities is found. This shown at step of

As shown in step of in one embodiment the functional flow analysis module determines functional flow information of the respective levels including a device level a infrastructure level and a cloud computation level one or more components of the respective levels or a combination thereof with respect to at least one set of one or more computation closures wherein the at least one set of one or more computation closures may be a set of computations associated with a process that is going to be executed in a distributed fashion. The functional flow can be utilized to identify the computational closures that should be executed at each step of the process. The functional flow analysis module may store the determined data in storage in information stores of clouds or a combination thereof and retrieve reuse the stored data when needed.

In one embodiment the closure distributor determining to cause at least in part processing at least the closure capability data determined by the capability evaluator the functional flow information determined by the functional flow analysis module or a combination thereof per step of to determine a distribution of the one or more computation closures among the respective levels device level infrastructure level cloud computation level the one or more components or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment at any step of computation distribution if any changes in the capabilities functional flows or any other parameters of the network are recognized as seen in step of e.g. power shut down fault in a component etc. which may affect the distribution process the capability evaluator will reevaluate the capabilities and the process of will restart from step . Alternatively if no change occurs in step the distribution process may be performed.

In one embodiment the capability evaluator and the functional flow analysis module determine the closure capability and functional flow information based at least in part on at least one cost function at least one computation migration rule or a combination thereof wherein the processing of at least the closure capability data the functional flow information or a combination by the closure distributor is further based at least in part on the at least one cost function the at least one computation migration rule or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the cost functions used by the capability evaluator and functional flow analysis module are provided by a cost function provider . The cost functions may be defined by device manufacturers distributed system management service providers or a combination thereof. One or more cost functions may be assigned to each architectural level or to every component of an architectural level. Furthermore definition of a cost function may take into consideration various factors affecting the cost of computations on a certain component or an architectural level such as energy consumption energy cost privacy and or security enforcement measures processing power speed etc.

In one embodiment the closure capability data may includes at least in part data related to one or more computational branches a part of computation that is executed for example in a component node of the infrastructure one or more computational elements one or more closures that comprise a process one or more resources processor storage power etc. or a combination thereof associated with the respective levels the one or more components or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the process of load balancing may start at device level UE level wherein the first branch of computational closures are executed within the device while higher levels of infrastructure level and cloud level are investigated for higher capabilities for load balancing. In another embodiment the direction of load balancing may be top down starting at the cloud level continuing at infrastructure level and ending at device level. For example the starting point for a service setup may be from cloud side wherein cloud services can be segmented and processed at the infrastructure level or device level since local computational aspects make it more beneficial to spread computations between infrastructures or devices rather than in cloud.

In another embodiment the computation migration rules used by the capability evaluator and functional flow analysis module are provided by a migration rule provider . The migration rules may be defined by distributed system management service providers or a combination thereof. One or more migration rules may be assigned to each architectural level or to every component of an architectural level. Furthermore definition of a migration rule may take into consideration various factors affecting the migration of computations from a component or an architectural level to another component or architectural level. The migration rules may include information about devices that the computations are being migrated from and being migrated to such as device configurations types formats etc. The rules can be used for mapping the computations from a start point to a destination.

In one embodiment either of the capability evaluator or the functional flow analysis module may consider a combination of results from cost functions and functional flows for determining the distribution of computation closures. In this embodiment the cost value calculator processes the at least one cost function provided by the cost function provider the at least one computation migration rule provided by the migration rule provider or a combination thereof to determine a cost value associated with at least a portion of the distribution. In this embodiment the closure distributor may determine to whether to initiate the at least a portion of the distribution based at least in part on a comparison of the cost value calculated by the cost value calculator against a threshold value. The threshold value may be a predefined value provided by the service provider system management etc. Additionally various factors such as history data computation characteristics and requirements etc. may affect the threshold value.

It is noted that the capabilities determination by the capability evaluator may be performed either statically dynamically or a combination thereof. In the case of static determination of capability the capabilities are determined prior to computation migration and the results are stored for closure distributor to refer to. In Under the static status the computation closures may be static as well meaning that the closures may consist of pre coded preprocessed pre computed functions or functions that their availability has been previously insured. As for static closures all the states of closure and functions are pre computed so that a particular input will always produce the same output and the internal states remain unchanged.

Alternatively the capability evaluator may dynamically monitor the capabilities prior to and during the computation migration and whenever diagnosing an unsatisfactory condition alert the closure distribution . In any case the capabilities determined by the capability evaluator may not be satisfactory for computation migration or the evaluation process may diagnose changes in the capabilities. For example excessive work load or congestion at an architectural level or at a component of the architectural level may result in unsatisfactory status of the level or the component for computation migration. In this case the update module recalculates computational closure capabilities and the needed level of computational closure is re evaluated by the capability evaluator . In this case the closures may be dynamic wherein the code is constructed during the execution and furthermore the internal state of the execution may vary. Also the output of the computation closure execution will change based on dynamically determined capabilities.

In one embodiment the functional flow analysis module utilizes the capability determination by the capability evaluator and analyzes the map of functional flow of migrating computations. The analysis results may be used for updating the functional flows. For example an unsatisfactory capability may cause the functional flow analysis search for new optimized flow maps in order to avoid or bypass the components with unsatisfactory status. The functional flow analysis module may also optimize the map by suggesting redistribution of computations for resolving the congestions.

In one embodiment the update module updates information associated with the closure capability data the one or more computation closures one or more executable states of the one or more computation closures the functional flow or a combination thereof. The closure distributor may process at least the update information to determine a redistribution of the one or more computation closures among the respective levels the one or more components or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the redistribution of computation closures by the closure distributor may include a least in part start stop a pause an interruption a resumption an interaction a termination a rollback or a combination thereof of at least a portion of the one or more computation closures. For example if the execution of computations fails the computation distribution process would be restarted another component selected for execution or another computational closure or a set of closures with different requirements is requested.

In this embodiment the pause interruption resumption interaction termination or rollback may be performed in response to an unsatisfactory level of capabilities for example to perform load balancing and optimize computation cost. For example the closure distributor may receive an alert from the capability evaluator during distribution stating work load congestion at one or more of the destination locations. The closure distributor may in response pause the distribution until the congestion is resolved and resume the distribution interrupt the distribution and resume the distribution to a new destination terminate the distribution and start a redistribution process etc.

In one embodiment the closure capability data provided by the capability evaluator the functional flow information provided by the functional flow analysis module or a combination thereof is processed by the closure distributor at least in part on traversal of at least one of the one or more computation closures from a first level of the respective architectural levels to at least a second level of the respective architectural levels from a first component of the one or more components to at least a second component of the one or more components or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment following the execution of the one or more distributed computations the result aggregator determines to cause at least in part retrieval of respective results of the computation closures based at least in part on the distribution and processes the results to generate an aggregated result. The aggregated result may then be stored in storage sent to the device that initially requested the execution or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the service class assignor may determine service class information associated with at least one user of the at least one set of the one or more computation closures. The service class may assign various priority levels to the computations associated with the users wherein the distribution the closure capability data the functional flow information an availability of at least a portion of the one or more computation closures at the respective levels or a combination thereof are based at least in part on the service class information.

In one embodiment connectors may contain information about parameters such as capabilities functional flows distribution maps links between closures and architectural levels etc. Arrows connecting closures to connectors and connectors to next closures show the functional flow adopted based on the parameters. As seen in the closures have been distributed from component to component via communication between connector and connector . The computation branch of component includes closures communicating via connectors and while branches and communicate via connectors and . Similarly a third branch has been formed of closures being executed at component and connected by connectors and while the branch communicates with other branches via connector . The final results from closure execution of the three branches and are aggregated by result aggregator and forwarded to the requesting device.

In one embodiment the initial branch may be in a UE the second branch in a component of the infrastructure and the third branch in another component of the same infrastructure a different infrastructure in a cloud or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment connectors may contain information about parameters such as capabilities functional flow specifications distribution maps links between closures and architectural levels etc. Arrows connecting closures to connectors and connectors to next closures show the functional flow adopted based on the parameters. For example star signs and represent the capability parameters provided by the capability evaluator and associated with each closure and respectively.

In one embodiment if the value of certain parameters such as cost based on the analyses by the capability evaluator and the functional flow analysis module exceed a certain thresholds some computational closure may be omitted from the chain in the current branch for the value to be reduced. The closures may be initially assigned with priority levels so that less important closures can be omitted if necessary. Similarly cost values and direct closures and in branch via connectors and .

In one embodiment the amount of work load describes the requirements for load balancing. The user of a UE is able to decide how different computational closure levels are projected. For example how different load levels should be handled what components should be used what restrictions to selected components are applied what is the service class priority level of each computation etc.

In one embodiment the distributed computation control platform is aware of work load at each level of the network for example between UEs in device level between components in infrastructure level between clouds in cloud level between infrastructures between cloud groups and between different levels of architecture. Additionally the distributed computation control platform is capable of utilizing computational resources and take additional resources e.g. computational branches when necessary. For example the distributed computation control platform may offload a process from one cloud to another cloud via the infrastructure level. The distributed computation control platform may also create and take into account load balancing parameters such as computational capabilities by the capability evaluator for each entity functional flow setup by the functional flow analysis module for any number of computational elements load balancing rules affecting the setup provided by migration rule provider etc.

In one embodiment the closure distributor utilizes the parameters such as capabilities and functional flow map shown by arrows in or B cost values and rules and etc. to perform load balancing during the closure distribution. As seen in in step the closure distributor parses a list of closure capabilities provided by capability evaluator . This list shows which closures can be executed at which architectural level of the computational environment e.g. device level infrastructure level or cloud level . Per step the functional flow of closures is identified by the functional flow analysis module based on the parameters such as capabilities. The functional flow analysis determines at every step of load balancing what will be the next computational component. Per step the capability evaluator receives cost values from the cost value calculator and compares the cost values against the parsed list of closure capabilities in order to select the most cost efficient next component capable of the current computations. Per step the capability evaluator and the functional flow analysis module apply the rules provided by the migration rule provider on the current computations and choices for the next computation component. The rules may eliminate some of the components that for example are not approved for having access to the computation for example for privacy or security reasons. Per step the closure distributor distributes the current computations to the selected components. It is noted that the computations may be distributed from a UE to many components of an infrastructure level for a UE to many components of multiple infrastructure levels from many components of multiple infrastructures to multiple clouds or a combination thereof.

Per step the receiving devices components clouds execute the distributed computation closures and produce execution results. The execution happens in many branches such as or of where one branch may be in the UE e.g. branch while other branches can distributed over many components where each component may execute a sub branch. Each component may store the execution results locally send the results to a collection point via the links to other components or a combination thereof. In step the result aggregator aggregates the results from distributed computations and produces the result of the overall process made of the distributed computations. The result may be stored locally in storage sent directly to the requesting UE sent to one or more components of infrastructures or clouds with connectivity to the requesting UE to be made accessible to the UE or a combination thereof.

However a backend device serving high numbers of users may be equipped with larger volumes of non volatile memory spaces. Because of the limited capacity of non volatile memory spaces on UEs a subset of the closure store is stored locally at the closure store for local use by the UE .

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link .

Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing load balancing in multi level distributed computations. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairment that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU not shown .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to provide load balancing in multi level distributed computations. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device may be but not limited to a single memory CD DVD ROM RAM EEPROM optical storage magnetic disk storage flash memory storage or any other non volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.

An optionally incorporated SIM card carries for instance important information such as the cellular phone number the carrier supplying service subscription details and security information. The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile terminal settings.
