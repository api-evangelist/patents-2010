title: RFID-based loss-prevention system
abstract: In RFID systems employed for loss prevention, an item supplier or an ingress reader writes an ownership code associated with an organization or facility into a tag, indicating that an item to which the tag is attached is associated with the facility and not foreign. At checkout or point-of-sale an authorization reader writes a digital signature into the tag indicating that the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility. At point-of-exit an exit reader determines if the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility by verifying the ownership code and the digital signature. The loss-prevention system may issue an alert or sound an alarm if a facility-associated item is leaving the facility without a proper digital signature indicating that the item is approved to leave.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 354 659 filed on Jun. 14 2010. The disclosures of the provisional patent application are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Radio Frequency Identification RFID systems typically include RFID tags and RFID readers. RFID readers are also known as RFID reader writers or RFID interrogators. RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying objects to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are particularly useful in product related and service related industries for tracking objects being processed inventoried or handled. In such cases an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item or to its package.

In principle RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency RF wave performs the interrogation. The RF wave is typically electromagnetic at least in the far field. The RF wave can also be predominantly electric or magnetic in the near field.

A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave responds by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag generates the transmitted back RF wave either originally or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.

The reflected back RF wave may further encode data stored internally in the tag such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader which thereby identifies counts or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number a price a date a time a destination other attribute s any combination of attributes and so on.

An RFID tag typically includes an antenna subsystem and a radio subsystem including a modem a power management section a logical section and a memory. In some RFID tags the power management section includes an energy storage device such as a battery. RFID tags with an energy storage device are known as active or battery assisted tags. Advances in semiconductor technology have miniaturized the electronics so much that an RFID tag can be powered solely by the RF signal it receives. Such RFID tags do not include an energy storage device such as a battery and are called passive tags. Regardless of the type all tags typically store or buffer some energy temporarily in passive storage devices such as capacitors.

RFID technology may be employed in loss prevention systems used for example by retailers. Point of Exit PoE readers deployed at store exits read tagged items exiting the store and determine if the item is approved to leave. However the determination can be a challenging one. In one approach a store database maintains information about all items in the store and indicates if an item is approved to leave. The PoE reader then checks the database for approval. Unfortunately implementing the database may be costly and or complex especially for large stores that contain a large number of items multiple entrances and exits and multiple Point of Sale or checkout registers collectively PoS that must continually update the database.

In another approach the tags themselves retain information about whether they are approved to leave the store and the PoE reader checks each tag for approval. Authorization readers at PoS may write a bit or bits to each tag indicating that the item is approved to leave. Unfortunately this approach is susceptible to thieves using unauthorized readers to illegitimately set the bit or bits typically necessitating a password based authorization system that is complicated to maintain and use and is itself susceptible to attack.

Finally for both approaches foreign tags entering a store such as a tag carried by a consumer on his or her person may further complicate the situation because the PoE reader must determine if a departing item is foreign or stolen.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Embodiments are directed to RFID systems for loss prevention. An ownership code OC associated with an organization or facility is stored in the tag indicating that an item to which the tag is attached is associated with the facility and not foreign a foreign tag indicates an item not associated with the facility . An authorization reader writes a digital signature DS into the tag to indicate that the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility. The DS is based on information stored in the tag such as the tag s item identifier or other tag information collectively an item identifier or II and or a temporal parameter TP based on a date and or time for example a date and or time of the authorization for the tagged item to be removed . The TP may have any numeric value such as the date itself a number generated based on the date a randomly generated number or similar values. The DS is also based on a secret or private key associated with the facility. A PoE reader verifies that for items whose OC is associated with the facility the DS is legitimate or proper and therefore the item is approved to leave the facility.

These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of aspects as claimed.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. These embodiments or examples may be combined other aspects may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

Reader and tag exchange data via wave and wave . In a session of such an exchange each encodes modulates and transmits data to the other and each receives demodulates and decodes data from the other. The data can be modulated onto and demodulated from RF waveforms. The RF waveforms are typically in a suitable range of frequencies such as those near 900 MHz 2.4 GHz and so on.

Encoding the data can be performed in a number of ways. For example protocols are devised to communicate in terms of symbols also called RFID symbols. A symbol for communicating can be a delimiter a calibration symbol and so on. Further symbols can be implemented for ultimately exchanging binary data such as 0 and 1 if that is desired. In turn when the symbols are processed internally by reader and tag they can be equivalently considered and treated as numbers having corresponding values and so on.

RFID tag can be a passive tag or an active or battery assisted tag i.e. having its own power source . Where RFID tag is a passive tag it is powered from wave .

RFID tag is formed on a substantially planar inlay which can be made in many ways known in the art. RFID tag includes an electrical circuit which is preferably implemented as an IC . IC is arranged on inlay .

RFID tag also includes an antenna for exchanging wireless signals with its environment. The antenna is usually flat and attached to inlay . IC is electrically coupled to the antenna via suitable antenna terminals not shown in .

The antenna may be made in a number of ways as discussed in more detail below. In the example of the antenna is made from two distinct antenna segments which are shown here forming a dipole. Many other embodiments are possible using any number of antenna segments.

In some embodiments an antenna can be made with even a single segment. Different points of the segment can be coupled to one or more of the antenna terminals of IC . For example the antenna can form a single loop with its ends coupled to the terminals. It should be remembered that when the single segment has more complex shapes even a single segment could behave like multiple segments at the frequencies of RFID wireless communication.

In operation a signal is received by the antenna and communicated to IC . IC both harvests power and responds if appropriate based on the incoming signal and the IC s internal state. In order to respond by replying IC modulates the reflectance of the antenna which generates backscatter from wave transmitted by the reader. Coupling together and uncoupling the antenna terminals of IC can modulate the antenna s reflectance as can a variety of other means.

In the embodiment of antenna segments are separate from IC . In other embodiments antenna segments may alternatively be formed on IC and so on. Furthermore an interface element may be used to couple the IC to the antenna segments not shown in .

The components of the RFID system of may communicate with each other in any number of modes. One such mode is called full duplex. Another such mode is called half duplex and is described below.

RFID reader and RFID tag talk and listen to each other by taking turns. As seen on axis TIME when RFID reader talks to RFID tag the communication session is designated as RT and when RFID tag talks to RFID reader the communication session is designated as TR . Along the TIME axis a sample R T communication session occurs during a time interval and a following sample T R communication session occurs during a time interval . Of course interval is typically of a different duration than interval here the durations are shown approximately equal only for purposes of illustration.

According to blocks and RFID reader talks during interval and listens during interval . According to blocks and RFID tag listens while RFID reader talks during interval and talks while RFID reader listens during interval .

In terms of actual technical behavior during interval RFID reader talks to RFID tag as follows. According to block RFID reader transmits wave which was first described in . At the same time according to block RFID tag receives wave and processes it to extract data and so on. Meanwhile according to block RFID tag does not backscatter with its antenna and according to block RFID reader has no wave to receive from RFID tag .

During interval RFID tag talks to RFID reader as follows. According to block RFID reader transmits a Continuous Wave CW which can be thought of as a carrier signal that ideally encodes no information. As discussed before this carrier signal serves both to be harvested by RFID tag for its own internal power needs and also as a wave that RFID tag can backscatter. Indeed during interval according to block RFID tag does not receive a signal for processing. Instead according to block RFID tag modulates the CW emitted according to block so as to generate backscatter wave . Concurrently according to block RFID reader receives backscatter wave and processes it.

An order a timing and other parameters of RFID tag reader communications may be defined by industry and or government set standards. For example Class 1 Generation 2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz 960 MHz Gen2 Protocol by EPCglobal Inc. is one such standard. Contents of Gen2 Specification version 1.2 are hereby incorporated by reference.

Local block is responsible for communicating with the tags. Local block includes a block of an antenna and a driver of the antenna for communicating with the tags. Some readers like that shown in local block contain a single antenna and driver. Some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers and a method to switch signals among them including sometimes using different antennas for transmitting and for receiving. And some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers that can operate simultaneously. A demodulator decoder block demodulates and decodes backscattered waves received from the tags via antenna driver block . Modulator encoder block encodes and modulates an RF wave that is to be transmitted to the tags via antenna driver block .

Local block additionally includes an optional local processor . Local processor may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include by way of examples and not of limitation digital and or analog processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors DSPs controllers such as microcontrollers software running in a machine such as a general purpose computer programmable circuits such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs Field Programmable Analog Arrays FPAAs Programmable Logic Devices PLDs Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASIC any combination of one or more of these and so on. In some cases some or all of the decoding function in block the encoding function in block or both may be performed instead by local processor . In some cases local processor may implement an encryption or authorization function in some cases one or more of these functions can be distributed among other blocks such as encoding block or may be entirely incorporated in another block.

Local block additionally includes an optional local memory . Local memory may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include by way of examples and not of limitation nonvolatile memories NVM read only memories ROM random access memories RAM any combination of one or more of these and so on. These memories can be implemented separately from local processor or in a single chip with local processor with or without other components. Local memory if provided can store programs for local processor to run if needed.

In some embodiments local memory stores data read from tags or data to be written to tags such as Electronic Product Codes EPCs Tag Identifiers TIDs and other data. Local memory can also include reference data that is to be compared to the EPC codes instructions and or rules for how to encode commands for the tags modes for controlling antenna secret keys key pairs and so on. In some of these embodiments local memory is provided as a database.

Some components of local block typically treat the data as analog such as the antenna driver block . Other components such as local memory typically treat the data as digital. At some point there is a conversion between analog and digital. Based on where this conversion occurs a reader may be characterized as analog or digital but most readers contain a mix of analog and digital functionality.

If remote components are indeed provided they are coupled to local block via an electronic communications network . Network can be a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN a Wide Area Network WAN a network of networks such as the internet or a mere local communication link such as a USB PCI and so on. In turn local block then includes a local network connection for communicating with communications network . Communications on the network can be secure such as if they are encrypted or physically protected or insecure if they are not encrypted or otherwise protected.

There can be one or more remote component s . If more than one they can be located at the same location or in different locations. They can access each other and local block via communications network or via other similar networks and so on. Accordingly remote component s can use respective remote network connections. Only one such remote network connection is shown which is similar to local network connection etc.

Remote component s can also include a remote processor . Remote processor can be made in any way known in the art such as was described with reference to local processor . Remote processor may also implement an encryption function similar to local processor .

Remote component s can also include a remote memory . Remote memory can be made in any way known in the art such as was described with reference to local memory . Remote memory may include a local database and a different database of a Standards Organization such as one that can reference EPCs. Remote memory may also contain information associated with command tag profiles keys or the like similar to local memory .

Of the above described elements it may be advantageous to consider a combination of these components designated as operational processing block . Operational processing block includes those components that are provided of the following local processor remote processor local network connection remote network connection and by extension an applicable portion of communications network that links remote network connection with local network connection . The portion can be dynamically changeable etc. In addition operational processing block can receive and decode RF waves received via antenna and cause antenna to transmit RF waves according to what it has processed.

Operational processing block includes either local processor or remote processor or both. If both are provided remote processor can be made such that it operates in a way complementary with that of local processor . In fact the two can cooperate. It will be appreciated that operational processing block as defined this way is in communication with both local memory and remote memory if both are present.

Accordingly operational processing block is location independent in that its functions can be implemented either by local processor or by remote processor or by a combination of both. Some of these functions are preferably implemented by local processor and some by remote processor . Operational processing block accesses local memory or remote memory or both for storing and or retrieving data.

RFID reader system operates by operational processing block generating communications for RFID tags. These communications are ultimately transmitted by antenna block with modulator encoder block encoding and modulating the information on an RF wave. Then data is received from the tags via antenna block demodulated and decoded by demodulator decoder block and processed by processing operational processing block .

Embodiments of an RFID reader system can be implemented as hardware software firmware or any combination. It is advantageous to consider such a system as subdivided into components or modules. A person skilled in the art will recognize that some of these components or modules can be implemented as hardware some as software some as firmware and some as a combination. An example of such a subdivision is now described together with the RFID tag as an additional module.

An RFID tag is considered here as a module by itself RFID tag conducts a wireless communication with the reader via the air interface . It is noteworthy that air interface is really only a boundary in that signals or data that pass through it are not intended to be transformed from one thing to another. Specifications as to how readers and tags are to communicate with each other for example the Gen 2 Specification also properly characterize that boundary as an interface.

RFID system includes one or more reader antennas and an RF front end module for interfacing with reader antenna s . These can be made as described above.

RFID system also includes a signal processing module . In one embodiment signal processing module exchanges waveforms with RF front end module such as I and Q waveform pairs.

RFID system also includes a physical driver module which is also known as data link module. In some embodiments physical driver module exchanges bits with signal processing module . Physical driver module can be the stage associated with the framing of data.

RFID system additionally includes a media access control module which is also known as MAC layer module. In one embodiment MAC layer module exchanges packets of bits with physical driver module . MAC layer module can make decisions for sharing the medium of wireless communication which in this case is the air interface.

RFID system moreover includes an application programming library module . This module can include application programming interfaces APIs other objects etc.

All of these RFID system functionalities can be supported by one or more processors. One of these processors can be considered a host processor. Such a host processor might include a host operating system OS and or central processing unit CPU as in module . In some embodiments the processor is not considered as a separate module but one that includes some of the above mentioned modules of RFID system . In some embodiments the one or more processors may perform operations associated with calculating and or writing an OC and or a DS to the tag as part of a loss prevention system.

User interface module may be coupled to application programming library module for accessing the APIs. User interface module can be manual automatic or both. It can be supported by the host OS CPU module mentioned above or by a separate processor etc.

It will be observed that the modules of RFID system form a chain. Adjacent modules in the chain can be coupled by appropriate instrumentalities for exchanging signals. These instrumentalities include conductors buses interfaces and so on. These instrumentalities can be local e.g. to connect modules that are physically close to each other or over a network for remote communication.

The chain is used in one direction for receiving RFID waveforms and in the other direction for transmitting RFID waveforms. In receiving mode reader antenna s receives wireless waves which are in turn processed successively by the various modules in the chain. Processing can terminate in any one of the modules. In transmitting mode waveform initiation can be in any one of the modules. Ultimately signals are routed to reader antenna s to be transmitted as wireless waves.

The architecture of RFID system is presented for purposes of explanation and not of limitation. Its particular subdivision into modules need not be followed for creating embodiments. Furthermore the features of the present disclosure can be performed either within a single one of the modules or by a combination of them.

As mentioned previously embodiments are directed to employing RFID readers and tags in a loss prevention system. Embodiments additionally include programs and methods of operation of the programs. A program is generally defined as a group of steps or operations leading to a desired result due to the nature of the elements in the steps and their sequence. A program is usually advantageously implemented as a sequence of steps or operations for a processor.

Performing the steps instructions or operations of a program requires manipulating physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities may be transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated or processed according to the steps or instructions and they may also be stored in a computer readable medium. These quantities include for example electrical magnetic and electromagnetic charges or particles states of matter and in the more general case can include the states of any physical devices or elements. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to information represented by the states of these quantities as bits data bits samples values symbols characters terms numbers or the like. It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities and that these terms are merely convenient labels applied to these physical quantities individually or in groups.

Embodiments furthermore include storage media. Such media individually or in combination with others have stored thereon instructions of a program made according to the embodiments. A storage medium according to the embodiments is a computer readable medium such as a memory and is read by a processor of the type mentioned above. If a memory it can be implemented in a number of ways such as Read Only Memory ROM Random Access Memory RAM etc. some of which are volatile and some nonvolatile.

Even though it is said that the program may be stored in a computer readable medium it should be clear to a person skilled in the art that it need not be a single memory or even a single machine. Various portions modules or features of it may reside in separate memories or even separate machines. The separate machines may be connected directly or through a network such as a local access network LAN or a global network such as the Internet.

Often for the sake of convenience only it is desirable to implement and describe a program as software. The software can be unitary or thought of in terms of various interconnected distinct software modules.

Digital signatures often employ asymmetric cryptography. A signatory also referred to as a sender possesses a private public key pair where the private and public keys are mathematically related to each other. The sender uses the private key to generate the DS. A recipient uses the sender s public key to verify the DS. A verified DS gives the recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender and that it was not altered in transit.

An important attribute of digital signatures is that they are difficult to forge or clone. A number of standards have been developed for digital signatures. The Digital Signature Standard DSS is a U.S. Government standard for digital signatures. DSS is specified in Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 186 1 and FIPS 186 3. FIPS 186 1 specifies two digital signature algorithms the Digital Signature Algorithm DSA and the RSA digital signature algorithm. FIPS 186 3 includes a third digital signature algorithm the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA . FIPS 180 3 Secure Hash Standard SHS specifies the hash functions to be used in conjunction with FIPS 186 1 and FIPS 186 3.

Item is typically delivered to facility with a tag having a preprogrammed II. In some embodiments tag may arrive pre preprogrammed with both an II and an OC. In other embodiments item may be delivered without tag and a tag is programmed with an II and an OC and attached to item in the facility. In yet other embodiments item may be delivered with a blank or unprogrammed tag leaving the II and OC to be programmed within the facility. Regardless of the tagging approach item enters point of ingress . An optional ingress station including an ingress reader reads tag and if the tag is lacking an II or OC writes them into the tag at operation . Note that ingress station can be located anywhere in facility can be outside the facility can be a separate facility which performs tag encoding or could even be a mobile reader such as a handheld device. Regardless of the methodology after ingress and encoding the tagged item containing an II and OC will be at location in the facility.

Items must be authorized to leave the facility. The authorization process is performed at authorization station using authorization reader . As described in process authorization reader interrogates tag attached to item confirms that the OC is associated with facility computes a DS using the facility s secret or private key and writes the DS into the tag. In some embodiments the DS may be computed at least in part from the tag s II. In other embodiments the DS may be computed at least in part from a TP. In some embodiments authorizing reader writes the TP into tag memory. In yet other embodiments the DS may be computed from the II and from the TP. A tag with a proper DS is authorized to leave the facility. As described above a DS may be derived using a secret key and a symmetric key cryptographic algorithm like AES or using a private key and an asymmetric key cryptographic algorithm like DSA.

At the facility point of egress a PoE reader located at PoE station interrogates the tag and reads its OC DS and optionally its TP and or II. As described at operation the PoE reader checks the tag s OC and if the item is associated with the facility then the PoE reader verifies that the DS is proper. PoE reader may verify the DS using the facility s secret for symmetric cryptosystems or using the facility s public key for asymmetric cryptosystems. If the DS is proper then item may be removed through point of egress . If the DS is not proper then PoE station may sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities that an unauthorized item is departing the facility. Points of ingress and egress and may include doors doorways hallways ramps garages and similar.

As indicated by comment II identifies the item to which the tag is attached. II may be a tag identifier TID an electronic product code EPC a unique item identifier UII a serialized global trade item number SGTIN or similar. Also as indicated by comment OC identifies the facility a parent of the facility an organization associated with the facility a manufacturer a retail seller etc. with which the item is associated. As indicated by comment DS is often calculated from II and a facility s secret or private key.

As indicated by comment RFID tag and by association the item attached to RFID tag may be considered authorized for removal from the facility if DS is regarded as proper by the facility s secret or public key. The secret or private public key pair may be managed or assigned by the facility a parent of the facility an organization associated with the facility a security agency or organization or similar. Of course as described above if OC of RFID tag does not match the facility s OC or if OC does not exist then RFID tag and by association the item attached to RFID tag may be considered to be not associated with the facility and therefore authorized for removal from the facility regardless of the DS value. To inhibit the unauthorized removal of items II and OC may be write locked or permanently write locked and thereby rendered unchangeable. According to some embodiments DS may be unlocked or permanently unlocked to facilitate erasure or overwriting for items returned to the facility.

Process begins with operation where the reader reads a tag s OC. At optional decision operation the reader determines whether the tag s OC matches the facility s OC. If the tag s OC does not match the facility s OC or does not exist then the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility at operation . If the tag s OC matches the facility s OC then the PoE reader may read the tag s II at optional operation and may read optional code s such as tag feature information or the TP at optional operation . At operation the reader reads the tag s DS. At operation the reader verifies the DS using a process like that of . At decision operation if the PoE reader finds the DS to be proper then the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility at operation . If the PoE reader finds the DS to be improper then the tagged item is not allowed to leave the facility at operation . One method for preventing an item with an improper DS from leaving a facility is by triggering an alert or alarm such as at optional operation . Although this document describes the reader operations as proceeding serially those skilled in the art will recognize that in any deployed RFID system one or more of these operations may be merged for example the authorization reader may read the tag s II OC DS and TP all at once .

The operations described in processes and are for illustration purposes only. An RFID based loss prevention system and its operations may be implemented employing additional or fewer operations and in different orders using the principles described herein.
