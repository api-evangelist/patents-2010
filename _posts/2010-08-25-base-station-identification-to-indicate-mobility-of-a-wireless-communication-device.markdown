Wireless communication networks typically include wireless communication devices which via a base station communicate with further communication networks and equipment. Each wireless communication device typically exchanges communications with a single base station while multiple wireless communication devices can communicate with the same base station simultaneously. When the wireless communication device is traveling a handoff from one base station to another may occur.

Typically a wireless communication device runs several applications that may require general mobility information for the wireless communication device. In some examples when a wireless communication device moves between base stations an application that utilizes the global positioning system GPS might require a GPS update but if no handoff has occurred the wireless communication device may postpone a GPS update to preserve battery power. For example a weather application could determine that a wireless communication device has relocated based on movement between base stations and therefore activate GPS to determine a precise location for a weather update. Typically such applications may attempt to gain access to course location messages CLM which provide the latitude and longitude of a serving network sector. The application requesting course location messages can determine that the wireless communication device has moved whenever a CLM indicates a new serving network sector. However the CLM also exposes the exact location of a network sector to the application.

A method of operating a base station identification system to indicate mobility of a wireless communication device comprises initiating a modulo count to indicate the mobility of the wireless communication device determining a last base station identifier for a last base station serving the wireless communication device comparing the last base station identifier to a set of previous base station identifiers for previous base stations serving the wireless communication device and if the last base station identifier is in the set of previous base station identifiers assigning a previous modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier wherein the previous modulo number was previously assigned to one of the previous base station identifiers matching the last base station identifier. The method further comprises if the last base station identifier is not in the set of previous base station identifiers assigning a next modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier and adding the last base station identifier to the set of previous base station identifiers. The method further comprises storing data indicating a sequence of the assigned modulo numbers for the modulo count.

The following description and associated drawings teach the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles some conventional aspects of the best mode may be simplified or omitted. The following claims specify the scope of the invention. Some aspects of the best mode may not fall within the scope of the invention as specified by the claims. Thus those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from the best mode that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below but only by the claims and their equivalents.

To begin base station identification system initiates a modulo count to indicate the mobility of wireless communication device . Base station identification system could initiate the modulo count at any time but the count is typically initiated when wireless communication device first registers with communication network or upon an initial request transmitted from wireless communication device for mobility information.

The modulo count typically comprises a repetitive number sequence. Thus in some examples base station identification system could initiate the modulo count by defining the repetitive number sequence for the modulo count. Typically the number sequence of the modulo count is ordered from lowest value to highest value and when counting up from lowest to highest the sequence returns to the lowest value after reaching the highest value. For example base station identification system could initiate the modulo count to a repeating sequence of the integers 0 99 so when counting up and 99 is reached the sequence loops back around to 0 for the next number and repeats counting up to 99 again. Although the size of the number sequence in the modulo count could be any size including limitless the size of the modulo count typically has a direct relationship to the size of communication network the number of base stations associated with communication network and or the number of users groups or devices utilizing communication network .

Referring again to base station identification system determines a last base station identifier for a last base station serving wireless communication device . In this example base station identification system identifies base station as the last base station serving wireless communication device because base station is the most recent base station to serve wireless communication device whether or not any other base stations were previously serving device . The last base station identifier for the last base station serving wireless communication device could comprise any information that uniquely identifies base station a sector of base station a communication network associated with base station or any other aspect associated with base station . In some examples the last base station identifier could indicate a sector of the last base station serving wireless communication device . Additionally or alternatively in some examples the last base station identifier could comprise a system identification number SID and a network identification number NID associated with a sector of base station .

Base station identification system compares the last base station identifier to a set of previous base station identifiers for previous base stations serving wireless communication device . Thus base station identification system typically maintains a list of previous base station identifiers in a database or some other storage system. In some examples base station identification system compares the last base station identifier to the set of previous base station identifiers for previous base stations serving wireless communication device to determine whether or not the last base station identifier is included in the set of previous base station identifiers.

If the last base station identifier is in the set of previous base station identifiers base station identification system assigns a previous modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier . The previous modulo number was previously assigned to one of the previous base station identifiers matching the last base station identifier . For example if the previous modulo number 5 was previously assigned to the last base station identifier then base station identification system assigns the previous modulo number 5 to the last base station identifier. In some examples base station identification system could assign the previous modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier by assigning the previous modulo number and a repeat number indicator to the last base station identifier and the repeat number indicator could indicate that the previous modulo number was already assigned to the last base station identifier. Base station identification system may additionally transfer the previous modulo number and the repeat number indicator for delivery to wireless communication device when a handoff to the last base station serving the wireless communication device occurs.

However if the last base station identifier is not in the set of previous base station identifiers base station identification system assigns a next modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier and adds the last base station identifier to the set of previous base station identifiers . For example if last base station identifier is not included in the set of previous base station identifiers then the next modulo number in the modulo count is newly assigned to the last base station identifier and the last base station identifier is added to the set of previous base station identifiers. Base station identification system typically associates the next modulo number with the last base station identifier when adding the last base station identifier to the set of previous base station identifiers. In some examples base station identification system could assign the next modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier by assigning the next modulo number and a new number indicator to the last base station identifier and the new number indicator could indicate that the next modulo number is newly assigned to the last base station identifier. In some examples base station identification system may additionally transfer the next modulo number and the new number indicator for delivery to wireless communication device when a handoff to the last base station serving the wireless communication device occurs.

When base station identification system assigns the next modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier the next modulo number in the modulo count could either be previously unassigned or assigned to a different base station identifier in the set of previous base station identifiers. Therefore in some examples if the next modulo number was already assigned to a previous base station identifier in the set of previous base station identifiers base station identification system unassigns the next modulo number from the previous base station identifier and removes the previous base station identifier from the set of previous base station identifiers. In this manner when base station identification system next determines that wireless communication device is served by the base station formerly assigned the previous base station identifier its base station identifier was removed and thus is not in the set of previous base station identifiers so base station identification system will assign a next modulo number in the modulo count to this base station.

At any time before during or after the above operational steps base station system may store data indicating a sequence of the assigned modulo numbers for the modulo count . Base station identification system could store the data indicating the sequence of the assigned modulo numbers in a database memory device or any data storage system internal and or external to system . In some examples base station identification system processes the sequence of the assigned modulo numbers for the modulo count to assign the previous modulo number in the modulo count to the last base station identifier. In addition as discussed above base station identification system could transfer the assigned modulo number for delivery to wireless communication device when a handoff to the last base station serving the wireless communication device occurs.

The above operation describes how base station identification system determines a last base station identifier for a last base station serving wireless communication device and assigns a modulo number in a modulo count to the last base station identifier. In this manner the base station identifier can be masked by the assigned modulo number. Advantageously base station identification system can transfer the assigned modulo number for delivery to wireless communication device when a handoff to the last base station serving the wireless communication device occurs to indicate mobility of device without providing the actual base station identifier or other information about base station system . An application running on wireless communication device that requests mobility information for device will only receive the assigned modulo numbers for base stations serving wireless communication device thereby preserving the privacy of the user of device and the network infrastructure of communication network .

Typically the modulo count might be set to a repetitive sequence of 0 99 but in this example base station identification system initiates the modulo count to the integers 0 9 for clarity. At the start of wireless communication device is running an application which has requested a notification from base station identification system when a change in sectors occurs. For example the application running on wireless communication device could use a Java Application Programming Interface API to request notifications of a change in sectors and receive the notifications through an EventListener interface. Thus the numbers in the boxes shown on represent the modulo numbers that base station identification system transfers to wireless communication device when device changes sectors after a handoff. If the number is underlined the number is a repeat value meaning that the number was already assigned to the corresponding sector and wireless communication device has visited the repeat sector at least once before. Thus an underlined number provides a repeat number indicator to the EventListener to inform the application that wireless communication device was previously served by this sector having the underlined number. However the number is not underlined if the number is a new modulo number meaning newly assigned to the corresponding sector. For example to provide a new number indicator the number is not underlined if the sector either had no previously assigned value or had a different number previously assigned.

In this example the modulo count starts at zero which is the first modulo number in the modulo count. In some examples the modulo count is reset to this first modulo number of the modulo count whenever wireless communication device is first powered on or first registers with communication network . In other examples a user of communication device or an application running on device could perform an explicit reset of the modulo count to the first modulo number through a protected API. A communication service provider that operates communication network could also reset the modulo count for wireless communication device at any time. For example operators of communication network could reset the modulo count when wireless communication device relocates to a new geographic area that is a far distance away from a previous geographic area where device was formerly operating.

Referring now to wireless communication device is first connected to a first sector of base station assigned modulo number 0. The number is not underlined to provide a new number indicator meaning this is either the first time that device has been served by this sector or the sector was previously assigned a different modulo number.

Continuing down the EventListener next receives a modulo number 1 when device is served by a second sector of base station modulo numbers 2 and 3 when device is served by two respective sectors of base station and modulo numbers 4 and 5 when device is served by two respective sectors of base station . Base station identification system next transfers modulo numbers 6 7 and 8 when device is served by three respective sectors of base station . Finally when device is served by a first sector of base station modulo number 9 is assigned to this sector and transferred to device . Note that all of the above numbers 1 9 are not underlined to indicate that these are new modulo number assignments for these sectors.

As wireless communication device curves east and travels below base station device is served by a second sector of base station . At this time all of the modulo numbers 0 9 in the modulo count have been assigned to their respective sectors so the modulo count loops back around. Therefore modulo number 0 is the next number in the modulo count and is assigned to the second sector of base station . The newly assigned sector 0 is not underlined to indicate that 0 is a new modulo number assignment for this sector. Based on the new number indicator the application running on wireless communication device could determine that any information previously associated with the old sector 0 is unrelated to this new sector 0.

Likewise base station identification system assigns modulo number 1 to the third sector of base station since 1 is the next number in the modulo count and the third sector of base station had no previously assigned value. When base station identification system assigns modulo number 1 to the third sector of base station identification system typically removes the previous assignment of modulo number 1 from the second sector of base station .

As wireless communication device curves north and travels up the right hand side of base stations device is again served by the first sector of base station that was previously assigned modulo number 9. Since no intervening sectors have been assigned a new modulo number 9 the first sector of base station is still assigned modulo number 9. Thus base station identification system transfers modulo number 9 to wireless communication device when device is again served by the first sector of base station . In modulo number 9 is underlined to provide a repeat number indicator which informs the application running on wireless communication device that device was previously served by this same sector the last time modulo number 9 was received by the EventListener.

Likewise wireless communication device re visits the third and first sectors of base station having previously assigned modulo numbers 8 and 6 respectively. Thus the numbers 8 and 6 are underlined in to show that repeat number indicators are provided for these sectors.

Next wireless communication device is served by a previously unvisited third sector of base station . Base station identification system therefore assigns the next number in the modulo count to this sector which is modulo number 2. Modulo number 2 is not underlined to show that this is a new value for this sector which indicates that device is currently served by a new sector 2 that is unrelated to the previous sector having modulo number 2.

Wireless communication device then travels up to the first sector of base station that was previously assigned modulo number 4. Since modulo number 4 was previously assigned to this sector and no sectors visited by device thereafter have been assigned modulo number 4 as a new value base station identification system retains the assignment of the previous modulo number 4 with this sector. The number 4 is shown underlined in to provide the repeat number indicator which indicates that the previous visit to this sector was associated with modulo number 4. Thus an application running on wireless communication device could determine that device is now being served by the same sector of base station as when modulo number 4 was previously assigned.

Continuing upward wireless communication device travels into an area served by a previously unvisited third sector of base station . Since no modulo number has been previously assigned to this sector base station system assigns modulo number 3 which is the next number in the modulo count. The number 3 is shown without an underline on to indicate that this is a new value. Note that the previous sector assigned modulo number 3 which incidentally is the second sector of this same base station is unassigned from modulo number 3 at this time. Thus if wireless communication device were to visit the old sector 3 at a future time not shown it would receive a new modulo number provided by the next number in the modulo count.

Referring again to wireless communication device travels north to a first sector of base station assigned modulo number 2 on a previous visit. However when wireless communication device was served by the third sector of base station this intervening sector was assigned modulo number 2. When the third sector of base station was assigned modulo number 2 the previous association between the first sector of base station and modulo number 2 was removed and replaced by the new assignment. Thus base station identification system assigns a next modulo number in the modulo count to the sector which is modulo number 4 in this example. The number 4 assigned to the first sector of base station is shown without underlining to indicate that this is a new number. Note that the assignment of modulo number 4 to the first sector of base station breaks the previous assignment of modulo number 4 to the first sector of base station .

Wireless communication device continues north to a previously unvisited third sector of base station . This sector is therefore assigned the next number in the modulo count which is modulo number 5. The number 5 is not underlined to show that 5 is a new value assigned to this sector.

Finally wireless communication device travels up to the first sector of base station which was previously assigned modulo number 0 at the start of this example. However when wireless communication device was served by the second sector of base station a new modulo number was required and the next modulo number in the modulo count was 0. Thus modulo number 0 was assigned to that sector and unassigned from the first sector of base station . Now when wireless communication device revisits the first sector of base station base station identification system assigns a new number for the sector from the next modulo number in the modulo count which is modulo number 6. Again the previous assignment of modulo number 6 to the first sector of base station is removed.

In some examples the internal tracking of modulo number to sector assignments could be implemented by mapping the system identification number SID and network identification number NID of a sector to the assigned modulo number. For example base station identification system could use these mappings to determine whether a modulo number was previously assigned to a sector. In this manner base station identification system can provide the assigned modulo number and a new or repeat number indicator when an application on wireless communication device requests mobility information for device . Advantageously the actual SID NID values of each sector are hidden from the application by the API thereby preserving the privacy of the user of device and preventing the application from potentially mapping the locations of base stations .

Communication interface may be configured to communicate over metallic wireless or optical links. Communication interface may be configured to use TDM IP Ethernet optical networking wireless protocols communication signaling or some other communication format including combinations thereof. Communication interface could be configured to transfer a modulo number for delivery to a wireless communication device.
