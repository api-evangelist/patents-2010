title: System and method for providing supplemental funds to progressive jackpots
abstract: Disclosed is a gaming system for playing a progressive game, wherein the progressive game has an initial increment rate and threshold limit, and each time the progressive game is played a contribution is made to a progressive jackpot's current value. The system includes: a display screen for displaying a gaming presentation, one or more player-activated buttons for receiving player input, and a processor that executes game software and processes input from the player-activated buttons. In this gaming system, each contribution increases the current value until the jackpot reaches the threshold limit, wherein once the threshold limit has been reached, the progressive jackpot uses a secondary increment, to speed up, slow down, or stop the amount contributed to the progressive jackpot. The progressive jackpot's current value is reset to a lower reset value, when a jackpot is won by a player. Further, the progressive game implements a hidden increment that channels contributions to an overflow amount. The progressive game is configured to increase a starting jackpot amount to more than the reset value after a jackpot win by adding the overflow amount to the reset value, thereby encouraging more game play.

The present invention is directed to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods and in particular to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods having progressive games.

In the prior art various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards such as cash or prizes. For example in some slot machines the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel thereby allowing for multiple line betting.

Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations the progressive prize may have a small probability of being won by a player. Such a configuration makes it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations the progressive prize may be a small amount which enables a player to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.

Supplemental features of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. In some embodiments such supplemental features are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In other embodiments in order to stimulate interest supplemental features are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays.

While gaming machines including feature games have been successful there remains a need for feature games that provide players with enhanced excitement and an increased opportunity of winning.

Briefly and in general terms the gaming system is disclosed for playing a progressive game wherein the progressive game has an initial increment rate and threshold limit and each time the progressive game is played a contribution is made to a progressive jackpot s current value. The system includes a display screen for displaying a gaming presentation one or more player activated buttons for receiving player input and a processor that executes game software and processes input from the player activated buttons. In this system each contribution increases the current value until the jackpot reaches the threshold limit wherein once the threshold limit has been reached the progressive jackpot uses a secondary increment to speed up slow down or stop the amount contributed to the progressive jackpot. The progressive jackpot s current value is reset to a lower reset value when a jackpot is won by a player. Continuing the progressive game implements a hidden increment that channels contributions to an overflow amount. The progressive game is configured to increase a starting jackpot amount to more than the reset value after a jackpot win by adding the overflow amount to the reset value thereby encouraging more game play.

In one embodiment of the gaming system the hidden increment implemented by the progressive game that channels contributions to the overflow amount begins before the threshold limit has been reached while in another embodiment of the gaming system the hidden increments begins after the threshold limit has been reached. Continuing in one aspect of the gaming system increasing the next starting jackpot amount to greater than the reset value by adding the overflow amount to the reset value assists in funding a next jackpot when the next jackpot is initially reset by using the overflow amount to contribute to the next jackpot instead of a previous jackpot in which the contributions were made to the overflow amount. Additionally if a jackpot game play runs for long enough the new jackpot starting amount which is equal to the reset value plus the overflow amount is worth more than a previous winning jackpot amount during which time the overflow amount from the jackpot game play was generated due to a large size of the overflow amount.

In another aspect of the gaming system the reset value is static and remains constant across a link within a jurisdiction. In this manner changing the reset value requires the initial revenue amount needed to fund the jackpot to be increased. In one embodiment the system enables the overflow amount to be used to create a reserve pool to fund future jackpots thereby lessening capital required to fund future progressive jackpots. Typically the contribution is defined by the increment rate.

In one embodiment of the progressive gaming system the player activated buttons are physical buttons while in another embodiment the player activated buttons are virtual buttons. Continuing in another aspect of one embodiment the availability of the progressive game is restricted based on the size of the wager the placement of the wager. In still another aspect a percentage of the wager is used to fund the progressive game. In yet another aspect the probability of winning the progressive game is dependent on the size of the wager.

Features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming systems and method for playing a game wherein the game includes one or more progressive games. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming systems and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the progressive gaming system with additional increments.

An example game in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention is shown in . A preferred embodiment of a progressive gaming system with additional increments shown in enables dollar amounts to be added to the jackpot reset amount. This encourages play immediately after a high jackpot amount has been hit by a patron. In this situation a jackpot is typically reset back to a low reset value. The special bonus progressive amount that is added by the disclosed embodiments may be added to a progressive jackpot over a set period either in hours days or weeks.

As shown in in a typical progressive game the multi area progressive gaming system MAPS has an initial increment rate and threshold limit defined within its system. Each time the progressive game is played a contribution is made to the progressive jackpot s current value . The contribution is defined by the increment rate . Each contribution increases the current value until it reaches the defined threshold limit . In some embodiments once the threshold limit has been reached the progressive jackpot uses a new contribution rate known as a secondary increment to speed up slow down or stop the amount contributed to the progressive jackpot. In this basic configuration when a jackpot is won by a player the progressive jackpot s current value is reset to a lower reset value . An example of a MAPS progressive gaming system is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 539 865 entitled Multi Area Progressive Gaming System filed on Oct. 9 2006 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

Referring again to in one embodiment the progressive gaming system with additional increments is configured to increase the starting jackpot amount after a jackpot win by adding an overflow amount to the reset value to encourage more play. Since the reset value is static and remains constant across a link within a jurisdiction merely changing the value does not achieve the same result. By increasing the reset value the initial revenue amount needed to fund the jackpot increases. In a preferred embodiment the progressive gaming system with additional increments implements the overflow amount to channel contributions through a hidden increment after the pre determined limit has been reached.

Once a reset value is defined for a progressive link it cannot be changed without approval from the gaming regulators. Using an overflow amount allows a manufacturer to keep the initial jackpot amount reset value overflow amount higher without the need for initial capital to fund the jackpot. Such a configuration also enables more granular control to jackpot increment rates thereby allowing a casino using the MAPS multi area progressive system as a LAP local area progressive system the ability to do the same.

As described above the progressive gaming system with additional increments enables casinos to increase progressive jackpot play by adding a feature which adds an overflow amount to an existing jackpot. Increasing this amount helps fund the next jackpot at a time when the jackpot is initially returned to a reset value . The GLI standards Gaming Laboratories International standards define language with regard to their progressive links description which allow for this configuration. The GLI standards do not define for what the overflow amount may be used. However since the overflow amount is a contribution it must be paid back to the patron.

The following pseudo code mimics the jackpot bonus behavior implemented into the MAPSX progressive database. One non limiting example of the pseudo code is shown below 

A first example of the implementation for the progressive gaming system with additional increments is described below for clarity purposes.

In this embodiment for each max coin bet placed the patron makes the following contribution to the progressive jackpot s current value before the limit is reached.

Continuing in this embodiment the model continues as in the else statement above until the limit is reached. At this stage the code then executes the if statement and makes the following contribution to the current value 

As shown the rate at which the progressive prize grows in this embodiment is slowed down to limit the casino s payout on a single jackpot. In some embodiments the secondary increment value is set to zero which in turn stops the jackpot s current value from growing any further thereby limiting the casino s liability in the event that a jackpot is won.

Next in some embodiments the hidden increment is then used to start funding the overflow amount . The overflow amount is calculation as follows 

In conclusion of the first example if the jackpot hits at 200 000 then each bet placed means the jackpot current value increases 0.10. Accordingly it then takes ten bets to increase the jackpot current value one dollar from the 100 000 limit and one million bets to increase the jackpot current value 100 000 from the 100 000 limit . In one aspect of an embodiment of the progressive gaming system with additional increments while the secondary increment adds an extra 100 000 to the progressive the hidden increment adds 150 000 to the overflow amount 

When a jackpot is hit the current value of 200 000 is paid to the patron by the casino. The current value is then returned to the reset value plus the overflow amount . These values are shown as follows 

Any extra money in overflow amount enables the new jackpot to increase instantly to an amount comparable to the old jackpot amount. If the jackpot runs for long enough the new jackpot amount is worth more than the old winning jackpot amount which boosts game play. This type of configuration gives the appearance to the patron in the short term that the jackpot increases with each successive hit and could be thought of as a reverse resetting progressive. 

Additionally with properly configured progressive rates and limits the progressive gaming system with additional increments enables the creation of a short term reverse resetting jackpot increasing the amount of money each successive jackpot is worth in the short term. In some embodiments the casino also has the option to use this overflow amount to create a reserve pool to fund future jackpots potentially lessening the capital required to fund a progressive jackpot. This creates an impression upon patrons that the jackpots are growing at a seemingly exponential rate over a short time due to the increasing successive jackpot during this time.

Another example of the implementation for the progressive gaming system with additional increments which further includes a reverse resetting jackpot is now described below for clarity purposes. This second example shows a reverse resetting jackpot by starting with the following numbers 

Continuing this second example starts the jackpot before any bets have been placed. In this example the hidden increment is taken from each bet the entire life of the jackpot instead of when the jackpot reaches the limit . Accordingly with each bet the hidden increment funds the overflow amount with 0.15. The calculations for this contribution are shown below 

In this example the initial increment component funds the present jackpot with 0.10 with each bet until the limit is reached. The calculations for this contribution are shown below 

In accordance with these calculations one bet increases the jackpot current value by 0.10 ten bets increases the jackpot current value by 1.00 and 500 000 bets increases the jackpot current value to the limit of 80 000. These calculations are shown below 

Continuing in this example the overflow amount is valued at 75 000 at the time that the limit is reached. These calculations are shown below 

With each successive bet after the limit has been reached the current value grows an additional 0.05. Accordingly 2.2 million bets will have been placed when the current value totals 300 000 with the overflow amount then valued at 405 000. If the jackpot hits at this time the patron is paid the current value of 300 000 and the jackpot is reset to 435 000. These calculations are shown below NEW CURRENT VALUE 30 000 reset value 405 000 overflow amount 435 000

In some embodiments of the progressive gaming system with additional increments a casino may only want to pay out a percentage of the overflow amount each time a jackpot is won for a set number of times . In one such an embodiment a casino may add only 75 of the overflow amount back to the new jackpot reset value . These calculations are shown below as follows 

As shown in in another embodiment the casino sets the payout percentage of the overflow amount to pay out a set number of times before adding the entire overflow amount to a new jackpot. This illustrates a short term reverse resetting jackpot and payout percentage of the overflow amount .

In another embodiment the progressive gaming system with additional increments may create the appearance of a reverse resetting jackpot for multiple jackpot hits as described above. While the example described above depicts the hidden increment being added only after the limit is reached the GLI standards do not define at what point a hidden increment may be taken during the life of a progressive jackpot. Notably in some embodiments of the progressive gaming system with additional increments the hidden increment is used throughout the entirety of the jackpot s life rather than waiting for the LIMIT to be reached. This results in the overflow amount being much larger and allowing for more funds to be dispersed.

In another aspect of some embodiments if the reset value is high enough and the limit and secondary increment low enough in correlation to a high hidden increment over time the overflow amount will generate enough funds in the reserve pool to allow for a jackpot to reset at 110 of its current value or more. In one embodiment the multi area progressive gaming system adds a percentage of the overflow amount to the next jackpot if the reset value component plus the overflow amount are greater than current value when the jackpot hits. This configuration limits the amount to be added and keeps the jackpot growing for a longer amount of time even though a jackpot has been won thereby allowing for a short frenzy of jackpots that continue to reset higher than the last winning jackpot amount which in turn generates increased game interest.

In still another aspect of some embodiments an additional use of the overflow amount is to fund the next jackpot s reset value which allows for a prize to be already partially paid. This embodiment of the progressive gaming system with additional increments limits the amount of capital needed by either a manufacturer or the casino to have on hand for the next jackpot. Once the overflow amount equals the reset value the database creates a future jackpot and subtracts the overflow amount needed to fund the jackpot from the overflow amount .

In accordance with one or more embodiments illustrate a gaming machine including cabinet housing primary game display upon which a primary game and feature game may be displayed top box which may display multiple progressives that may be won during play of the primary or feature game player activated buttons player tracking panel bill voucher acceptor and one or more speakers .

Cabinet housing houses a processor circuitry and software not shown for receiving signals from the player activated buttons operating the games and transmitting signals to the respective displays and speakers. Any shaped cabinet may be implemented with any embodiment of gaming machine so long as it provides access to a player for playing a game. For example cabinet may comprise a slant top bar top or table top style cabinet. The operation of gaming machine is described more fully below.

In another aspect of one embodiment the plurality of player activated buttons may be used for various functions such as but not limited to selecting a wager denomination selecting a game to be played selecting a wager amount per game initiating a game or cashing out money from gaming machine . Buttons function as input mechanisms and may include mechanical buttons electromechanical buttons or touch screen buttons. Optionally a handle may be rotated by a player to initiate a game.

In other embodiments buttons may be replaced with various other input mechanisms known in the art such as but not limited to a touch screen system touch pad track ball mouse switches toggle switches or other input means used to accept player input. For example one input means is a universal button module as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 106 212 entitled Universal Button Module filed on Apr. 14 2005 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. Generally the universal button module provides a dynamic button system adaptable for use with various games and capable of adjusting to gaming systems having frequent game changes. More particularly the universal button module may be used in connection with playing a game on a gaming machine and may be used for such functions as selecting the number of credits to bet per hand. In other embodiments a virtual button deck may be used to provide similar capabilities. An example of a virtual button deck is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 938 203 entitled Game Related Systems Methods and Articles That Combine Virtual and Physical Elements filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

Cabinet housing may optionally include top box which contains top glass comprising advertising or payout information related to the game or games available on gaming machine . Player tracking panel includes player tracking card reader and player tracking display . Voucher printer may be integrated into player tracking panel or installed elsewhere in cabinet housing or top box .

In other aspects of the invention gaming machine may present a video or mechanical reel slot machine a video keno game a lottery game a bingo game a Class II bingo game a roulette game a craps game a blackjack game a mechanical or video representation of a primary wheel game or the like.

Mechanical or video mechanical embodiments may include game displays such as mechanical reels wheels or dice as required to present the game to the player. In video mechanical or pure video embodiments game display is typically a CRT or a flat panel display in the form of but not limited to liquid crystal plasma electroluminescent vacuum fluorescent field emission or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art. Game display may be mounted in either a portrait or landscape orientation and be of standard or widescreen dimensions i.e. a ratio of one dimension to another of at least 16 9 . For example a widescreen display may be 32 inches wide by 18 inches tall. A widescreen display in a portrait orientation may be 32 inches tall by 18 inches wide. illustrates an example of a portrait mode game display having widescreen dimensions in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Additionally game display preferably includes a touch screen or touch glass system not shown and presents player interfaces such as but not limited to credit meter not shown win meter not shown and touch screen buttons not shown . An example of a touch glass system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 942 571 entitled Gaming Device with Direction and Speed Control of Mechanical Reels Using Touch Screen which is hereby incorporated by reference. Furthermore as described above game display may include transparent portions which cover and may interact with displays on mechanical reels as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 113 112 entitled MECHANICAL REELS WITH INTERACTIVE DISPLAY filed on Apr. 30 2008 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

Game display may also present information such as but not limited to player information advertisements and casino promotions graphic displays news and sports updates or may even offer an alternate game. This information may be generated through a host computer networked with gaming machine on its own initiative or it may be obtained by request of the player using either 1 one or more of the plurality of player activated buttons 2 the game display itself if game display comprises a touch screen or similar technology 3 buttons not shown mounted on game display which may permit selections such as those found on an ATM machine where legends on the screen are associated with respective selecting buttons or 4 any player input device that offers the required functionality.

Cabinet housing incorporates a single game display . However in alternate embodiments cabinet housing or top box may house one or more additional displays or components used for various purposes including additional game play screens animated top glass progressive meters or mechanical or electromechanical devices not shown such as but not limited to wheels pointers or reels. The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to EGM Processor Board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board PID and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having an interactive wheel game as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board executes a game program that causes processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having an interactive wheel feature game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon.

The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming machine . For example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board a GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID which is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provides messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software or gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board using gaming kernel by calling it into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents is passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able to make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started. The configuration manager has the data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger. Otherwise stated the logger object is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment deletes the oldest logged event each logged event has a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events are found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters. The soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during startup from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers and the like that may generate errors. A random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. The RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there typically are event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes. After the dispensing finishes the cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. The cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager addressing requirements for controlling interfacing and managing actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of an 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected are sent as IPC messages to game manager . Preferably all of this processing is asynchronously performed.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligently distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to retrieve the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
