In an embodiment of the present invention the color of certain graphical information provided by the server via the various GUIs presented may be dictated by detected or target performance information. Various modules of the fitness monitoring service of the present invention may be programmed with algorithms for establishing one or more performance parameter ranges or zones. Each zone may be associated with a particular color. Zones may be defined for example as ranges of percentages of an athlete s maximum speed or heart rate. Accordingly each zone may be associated with a particular level of effort.

In an embodiment an additional zone for example a pink zone may also be provided that overlaps the ranges of the blue green and yellow zones. The pink zone may primarily be used for setting intensity goals for beginners. In a further embodiment the colors may change in character from relatively light or dim colors to relatively dark or intense colors as values associated with the zone colors increase from the lower to upper limits of the zone.

The zones may be assigned based on predetermined fitness goals. For example in the embodiments of the energy zone blue may be associated with a heart rate or pace range respectively that allows an athlete to build their aerobic base. The endurance zone green may be associated with a heart rate or pace range respectively that allows an athlete to build cardiovascular strength and burn calories. The strength zone yellow may be associated with a heart rate or pace range respectively that allows an athlete to improve their aerobic threshold endurance and metabolism. The power zone red may be associated with a heart rate or pace range respectively that allows an athlete to improve their anaerobic threshold endurance and metabolism.

For pre activity planning purposes the zones can be presented to the user as an indication of the difficulty of a particular workout. For monitoring and tracking purposes during and after the activity as described in further detail below the zones may be established for a particular athlete based on for example a maximum heart rate or a maximum speed.

In particular an athlete s maximum heart rate may not change significantly with training and it may be set by the athlete s genetics. An athlete s maximum heart rate can be provided to the fitness monitoring service of the present invention in a number of ways as described in further detail below. In contrast an athlete s maximum speed may change significantly with additional training.

As indicated above in embodiments of the present invention the menu bar may be present on every GUI page presented to the user by the application software of server . Accordingly at any time the user may be able to navigate to portions of the website supported by different modules sub modules or wizards by selecting their corresponding icons from the menu bar with for example the cursor or a touch screen interface. In one embodiment the user may be able to select an icon corresponding to the plan module from the menu bar .

In one embodiment of the present invention from the main plan page the plan module may enable the user to select training plan icons associated with various training plan sub modules such as for example a Learn to Run sub module a Be Fit sub module a Run a Race sub module a De Stress sub module a Lose Weight sub module and a Finish Faster sub module. Training plan sub modules of embodiments of the present invention may include features such as for example those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 468 025 titled Program Products Methods and Systems for Providing Fitness Monitoring Services which has previously incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In an embodiment of the present invention training plan icons may be associated with various training plan sub modules that are sport specific. For example training plan sub modules designed to provide training plans to athletes who desire to train for and or maintain their conditioning for certain sports such as for example soccer i.e. football American football tennis inline skating rugby cycling and or basketball may also be provided.

Each plan module sub module may be associated with a different training plan having a different intended athlete audience and different goals. For example in one embodiment of the invention the Run a Race sub module may provide a plurality of different plans depending on the distance of the race the athlete is planning to participate in. Plans may be provided for example for 5K 10K marathon and full marathon races. An athlete utilizing one of the Run a Race programs may be encouraged to for example conduct interval or other speed work training take long runs and recovery runs and generally build their endurance and aerobic capacity so that they are able to successfully complete their race.

Once a difficulty level for a prospective plan has been selected via level selector the particular training plan sub module provides the plan preview for the plan. The plan preview may include a description of what to expect from the plan a description of the benefits of the plan and or a sample schedule. The plan description may make reference to the particular color coded pace speed or heart rate zones that an athlete may be prompted to exercise at as part of that plan.

After determining which plan best suits the athlete s needs the user may select an icon that enables plan module to launch a plan personalization wizard. The plan personalization wizard may prompt the user to select a start date for their training plan so that the plan may be built forward from that date. For users who select a race oriented plan such as those provided by the Run a Race sub module personalization wizard may prompt the user to select the day of the athlete s race so that the plan may be built backward from the race date. The plan personalization wizard may further prompt the user to give their plan a name. In one embodiment the wizard may provide a default name. In this way a user who wishes to schedule multiple training plans may be able to distinguish one plan from another by the plans names.

In one embodiment after the user finalizes their plan via the personalization wizard schedule module may populate a GUI calendar with the user s plan e.g. individual workouts of the plan . In addition at any other time when the user is logged in to the server the user may be able to navigate to the GUI calendar by selecting the icon corresponding to the schedule module from the menu bar .

The individual workouts populated into the calendar may be represented by a zone bar indicator . The zone bar indicator may communicate several pieces of information. It may indicate the number of intervals to be performed in a workout comprised of training intervals. It may also indicate the relative intensities of each interval to be performed based on for example a target heart rate pace or speed zone as indicated by a color. The calendar may also indicate the duration of each workout scheduled for each date. The GUI page containing the calendar may also provide an indication of the number of workouts and or number of weeks remaining for the current plan.

In one embodiment the user may be able to access a workout list containing a listing of all workouts of their currently selected plan by selecting an appropriate icon with for example their cursor or a touch screen interface. The workout list is another way of presenting the workout information populated on to calendar .

In addition a custom workout wizard may allow a user to add workouts to their calendar regardless of whether or not an athlete is currently participating in a scheduled plan program. If an athlete is participating in a scheduled plan program the custom workout feature may be used to supplement the plan with additional workouts remove workouts or edit workouts as the user desires.

The custom workout wizard may allow a user to build a workout with a single zone or a workout with a plurality of zone intervals. In an embodiment as shown in the custom workout wizard may present a GUI page that allows the user to build a custom workout one interval at a time in a graphical manner. The GUI page may include an interval builder bar that in some ways resembles a zone bar indicator . After selecting an particular segment of the interval builder bar with for example a cursor the user may assign a zone intensity color and an interval duration to the segment using drop down menus.

For example in the embodiment of the user has so far constructed an interval builder bar that includes a series of 30 second red zone dark grey shading and green zone black shading intervals. Such a pattern would allow the athlete to conduct 30 second red zone sprints. In addition the interval builder bar includes five minute blue zone intervals cross hatched shading at the start and finish. These blue zone intervals may serve as warm up and cool down periods and the user may enable them by checking an appropriate checkbox. By selecting a particular interval builder bar segment such as segment the GUI page may display details about the particular segment in an interval details box . For example interval details box indicates that segment is a 30 second red zone interval. The user could modify segment by adjusting the zone and duration options in interval details box .

In one embodiment the zone interval times may be predetermined periods of time e.g. 30 seconds 1 minute 5 minutes . In another embodiment the user may be able to adjust or program the zone interval time periods.

In addition the user may be able to name the custom workout and provide notes regarding its goal or purpose and may save the custom workout for future use and population in calendar .

In one embodiment of the present invention as outlined above in the application software of server may be configured to include a route module . The route module may be capable of generating routes for the athlete to follow during a fitness activity storing routes within a route database for subsequent access and downloading the routes to portable fitness monitoring devices . The route module may also include additional features such as those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 759 289 titled Location aware fitness training device methods and program products that support real time interactive communication and automated route generation which has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In an embodiment the route module may include a route wizard that is capable of guiding a user who may or may not be the athlete through a step by step process for generating routes having desired parameters and attributes. Route module may have access to a locally or remotely stored map database that stores street and or trail information in association with at least latitude and longitude information and possibly elevation information. Thus given at least one terminal point e.g. a starting point route module may be able to construct one or more routes having a desired length elevation profile and other parameters and attributes. In one embodiment the user may be able to build a new route from scratch or search for an existing route within a route database.

If the user opts to build a new route from scratch the user may first be prompted to designate an approximate starting point of the route by for example entering a street address ZIP code or a particular point of interest. Next the user may be prompted to enter a desired overall length of the route specified either by distance or by time if these parameters are not already specified for a particular workout of a training plan. If time is utilized to specify the length of the route a desired or historical average pace may be necessary so that a route distance can be computed. In addition the user may also be prompted to enter optional route attributes such as for example a desired elevation profile of the route or a desired pattern of the route e.g. linear loop etc. . Once the user has entered all required parameters and any optional route attributes the route module may build one or more routes conforming as closely as possible to the route parameters and route attributes entered. The presentation of such routes by a route wizard is described in further detail below.

If the user opts to search for an existing route within a route database the user may be permitted to specify a location of the route by for example city name ZIP code or point of interest. The user may further be prompted to enter optional route attributes such as for example a desired elevation profile of the route a desired pattern of the route desired safety characterization of the route and or a desired route difficulty rating. In one embodiment the route difficulty rating may be assigned to the route based on one or more of route length elevation changes over the route and altitude of the route.

In an embodiment as shown in the route wizard may present a navigable geographical map populated with graphical indications of locations for which preexisting routes are stored within the route database. In the depicted embodiment the map includes a graphical representation of a geographical area for example a political cultural or regional boundary. Within the geographical representation the route wizard may present a number of indicia identifying geographic locations of one or more pre existing routes for which route database stores route data. In response to the user hovering over one of indicia utilizing for example a cursor the route wizard may display in a pop up window route maps of the routes in the geographic location corresponding to the selected indicia . If the user visually identifies one or more routes of interest at a particular geographical location through visual inspection of indicia and or the route maps displayed within windows the user may select that geographical location by clicking on the associated indicia . In this manner a GUI window and its associated functionality provide the user with a graphical and intuitive way of viewing and selecting route locations of interest.

Once a particular route is chosen by the user the route may be associated with one or more workouts of the training plan scheduled on the calendar. In one embodiment the route may be transformed into a sequence of turn by turn instructions and transmitted to the portable fitness monitoring device prior to the activity. In an embodiment the route may be transmitted to the portable fitness monitoring device as part of or simultaneously with a workout routine.

As indicated above the menu bar may include an icon corresponding to the support module of the application software.

The support module may include help and settings sub modules. The help sub module may present GUI pages that contain general information about the fitness monitoring system of the present invention including a brief description of the system its intended users and the potential benefits available to those users. The help sub module may provide a description of the various functions of the interactive website supported by the software and the underlying modules sub modules and wizards.

The settings sub module of the support software module may be capable of displaying GUI windows for collecting storing and or reviewing personal settings workout settings device settings and or privacy settings.

In addition a user may access the coaching settings feature to adjust their zone ranges if they feel that the current zone ranges are not ideal. For example in one embodiment a user could manually enter new zone ranges. In another embodiment as illustrated in the GUI of the coaching settings page may ask the athlete how they feel. The athlete may indicate for example via selector bar that the zones feel too easy easy good hard or too hard. The coaching settings page may provide guidance to the athlete to help the athlete properly answer the question. For example the coaching settings page may indicate that the too hard option should be selected if the athlete has to sprint to reach the green zone. In response to the athlete s selection the system of the present invention may adjust the athlete s performance zone ranges appropriately. In an embodiment the zone adjustments may be made in response to a series of questions that seek to determine an appropriate intensity level for the athlete .

The settings sub module may also allow an athlete to enter workout settings information. Workout settings information may include preferences such as preferred distance units miles vs. kilometers height units feet and inches vs. meters and centimeters weight units pounds vs. kilograms time format 12 hour clock vs. 24 hour clock and a preferred week start date e.g. Sunday or Monday . Workout settings information may also include fitness profile information such as the athlete s weight height gender and maximum heart rate if known . In one embodiment the athlete may be periodically prompted by the system to update their fitness profile information.

For example via the settings page the user may be able to adjust audio feedback options provided by the portable fitness monitoring device during a workout as described in further detail below. In one embodiment the user may select audio feedback with different types or styles of voices such as for example voices of different gendered speakers voices with different accents voices in different languages voices from celebrities or fictional characters and voices of different tones e.g. supportive calming energizing or stern . In another embodiment the user may select specific performance parameter measurements to be recited via audio feedback during the workout. For example a user may choose to have elapsed time calories burned and distance traveled so far announced to the athlete at regular intervals on demand or at predetermined times locations throughout the workout.

In one embodiment of the system of the present invention an athlete may interact with a portable fitness monitoring device such as those illustrated in just prior to and or during a fitness activity.

This application software includes a number of different software modules capable of providing fitness monitoring services to athletes using portable fitness monitoring devices . In one embodiment of the present invention these modules include a start module a go module a track module an explore module a settings module and a positioning system smoothing sub module . Each module may support one or more GUIs capable of being presented to an athlete using the portable fitness monitoring device . Embodiments of the present invention may employ additional portable fitness monitoring device software features such as for example those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 892 023 titled Sports Electronic Training System and Applications Thereof which has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As described above with respect to display via the personal computer a GUI may offer for example graphical elements visual indicators and or text to represent information and actions available to the athlete . The athlete may use a physical input device such as keyboard or scroll ball to interact with the GUI of the portable fitness monitoring device . Alternatively the athlete may use a touch screen to interact directly with what is displayed. Various touch screens such as for example resistive or capacitive touch screens may be employed.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative or additional software modules and sub modules may be implemented in order to provide or extend the described or additional functionalities to the athlete using the portable fitness monitoring device . For example the software configuration of software stored on a portable fitness monitoring device may include a portable device operating system which may be one of the commercially available mobile phone operating systems such as for example BlackBerry OS iPhone OS Windows Mobile Symbian LINUX WebOS or Android. The portable device operating system may also have an associated application programming interface through which middleware and application programs may access the services of the operating system.

The various modules of the fitness monitoring service of the present invention may support GUIs through which an athlete can interact with the fitness monitoring service using the portable fitness monitoring device just prior to and or during an activity. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in one embodiment the GUIs may be supported by a mobile device web application being run on the portable fitness monitoring device . In another embodiment the GUIs may appear as web pages provided by the server via a website that may be accessible to the user over the internet using a web browser on their portable fitness monitoring device .

In order to access the features of embodiments of the present invention just prior to or during a physical activity the athlete using the portable fitness monitoring device may power on their portable fitness monitoring device if it is not already in a powered up state. In some embodiments it may be necessary for the athlete to manipulate user input controls to enter a portable fitness monitoring mode to access the application software.

The first time the fitness monitoring application is launched the start module may prompt the athlete to select a preferred language. Next or immediately upon subsequent launches of the application the start module may prompt the athlete to enter a password to proceed. The first time the application is launched the start module may prompt the athlete to select a password.

Upon entering the correct password a GUI supported by the start module may ask the athlete if they would like to link their portable fitness monitoring device to a web account previously set up via the server or if they would like to proceed as an un linked guest.

If the athlete indicates via activation of the user input controls that the athlete would like to link to a web account the start module may present a GUI login wizard wherein the athlete is able to log into and link to their web account. Upon linking to the web account settings previously established using the personal computer and the server via the support module may be transferred to or synced with the portable fitness monitoring device . Such settings may include for example workout settings information such as preferred distance units miles vs. kilometers height units feet and inches vs. meters and centimeters weight units pounds vs. kilograms time format 12 hour clock vs. 24 hour clock and a preferred week start date e.g. Sunday or Monday fitness profile information such as the user s weight height and maximum heart rate if known heart rate pace or other custom workout interval setting information audio feedback option information and or performance parameter feedback option information.

If the athlete indicates via activation of the user input controls that the athlete does not have or does not want to link to a web account the start module may present a login wizard where in the athlete is able to enter information such as for example preferred unit preferences personal information such as the athlete s age height weight and sex and or the athlete s desired voice training options. This information may be necessary for conducting an assessment workout for a guest athlete as described in further detail below.

After the athlete chooses to link to a web account or to continue as a guest the start module may present a home page GUI as illustrated in . During subsequent launches of the software application the home page may be presented to the athlete immediately upon launch. As shown in a header may be present near one of the edges of a GUI window of the present invention. In one embodiment the header may be present on every GUI page presented to the athlete by software accessible by the portable fitness monitoring device .

The home page may also include several icons or indicia corresponding to the go track explore and settings modules. In one embodiment the header may also provide a drop down list including icons or indicia corresponding to the go track explore and settings modules. After launching the application software the athlete may cause different GUI pages to be provided by different modules by selecting their corresponding icons using user input controls . Additional icons corresponding to sub modules or program wizards associated with a particular module may pop up or otherwise be displayed to the athlete if the athlete selects or hovers over a module icon with a cursor.

The settings module may offer functionalities similar to those described above with respect to the support module of the application software of the server .

The go module may include a workout selection sub module and a workout recording sub module. In one embodiment when the athlete selects the icon corresponding to the go module on the home page the go module initiates the workout selection sub module.

As previously described a user who may or may not be the athlete stationed at a remotely located personal computer may use a website to plan and schedule a prospective physical activity. As illustrated in the user may utilize the plan module and schedule module to plan and schedule one or more prospective physical activities. For example the user may select a training plan comprised of individual workouts which may be saved and scheduled on a calendar on the server . The user may also create save and optionally schedule custom workouts on the server . Alternatively an athlete user may plan and schedule planned workouts and or create save and schedule custom workouts by accessing the website directly from their portable fitness monitoring device . In one embodiment the version of the accessible from the athlete s portable fitness monitoring device may be simplified or otherwise modified to optimize it for display on a relatively small screen.

In an embodiment upon initiation of the workout selection sub module via the portable fitness monitoring device the list of available plan workouts and custom workouts may be updated by syncing to training plan plan workout and custom workout data available on the server . In other words the portable fitness monitoring device and the server may communicate training plan plan workout and custom workout data via the network for example using the WWAN transceiver of the portable fitness monitoring device . In one embodiment plan workout and custom workout data such as plan or custom workout routines may be stored in the memory of the portable fitness monitoring device .

The exemplary GUI window shown in may also include buttons switches drop down menus or other GUI elements for selecting voice coaching satellite positioning system and live tracking options.

Voice coaching generally refers to verbal instructions feedback or encouragement provide audibly to the athlete during the activity as described in further detail below. A workout selection sub module may allow the athlete to determine the level of voice coaching they would like to receive if any. For example in one embodiment the athlete may select between no coaching passive coaching or active coaching.

 No coaching may refer to a situation where voice coaching is entirely absent or silenced during the activity.

 Passive coaching may refer to a situation where the athlete receives voice coaching only at the beginning of a new training interval. For example an athlete who is to begin a green zone training interval may receive coaching that states increase your intensity to reach the green zone. If the training plan workout calls for the athlete to begin a yellow zone interval after the green zone interval at the beginning of the yellow zone interval athlete may receive coaching that states You have completed a green zone interval. Increase your intensity to enter the yellow zone. 

 Active coaching may refer to a situation where in addition to or instead of receiving voice coaching at the beginning of a new training interval the athlete receives reactive voice coaching throughout the interval. Specifically the voice coaching may be responsive to performance information detected by sensors of the portable fitness monitoring device . Thus for example feedback may be based on information detected by a heart rate monitor for a workout routine comprised of heart rate based zones or feedback may be based on information detected by a positioning system receiver used to calculate speed or pace for a workout routine comprised of speed based or pace based zones. For example if the athlete should be in the middle of their first green zone interval but is only maintaining a blue zone intensity the portable fitness monitoring device may announce your intensity is only at a blue zone level increase your intensity to enter the green zone. 

Workout selection sub module may also allow the athlete to determine the whether the positioning system receiver such as a GPS receiver should be enabled or disabled. In one embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device includes a GPS receiver that may be used to determine that athlete s location distance traveled speed and pace at various locations as the athlete traverses a route. In other embodiments a GPS receiver may not be present. Even if a GPS receiver is present the athlete may chose to disable it because for example the athlete intends to workout indoors workout on stationary equipment or because the portable fitness device is low on power. In an embodiment the athlete may also be able to enable or disable other sensors such as heart rate monitors or accelerometer based sensors.

Workout selection sub module may further allow the athlete to determine whether live tracking should be enabled or disabled. Live tracking refers to the ability of a remote user other than the athlete to track the athlete s location in real time during the activity. As explained in further detail elsewhere in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be able to wirelessly communicate location based information to the server via the network in real time via the WWAN or WPAN transceiver. Thus users with access to this data on the server either stationed at a remote computer or carrying a portable fitness monitoring device may be able to view one or more athlete s locations for example superimposed on a map. Some athlete s may chose to disable live tracking for example because of privacy concerns.

After the athlete desiring to partake in a training plan workout has made their selections regarding any available options in response to prompts from the workout selection sub module the workout recording sub module of the go module may initiate execution of the plan workout routine and begin recording.

As indicated above however an athlete may not desire to partake in a training plan workout and may instead prefer to engage in a custom workout. As previously described a user stationed at a remotely located personal computer may use a website to build a custom workout. Alternatively the athlete may access the website directly from their portable fitness monitoring device to build a custom workout. The steps for selecting a custom workout routine and choosing the appropriate options are similar to those outlined with respect to . illustrate a series of exemplary GUI windows that may be displayed by the workout selection sub module when the athlete selects custom workout routine. After the athlete desiring to partake in a custom workout has made their selections regarding any available options in response to prompts from the workout selection sub module the workout recording sub module of the go module may initiate the execution of a custom workout routine and begin recording.

If however the athlete not desire to partake in either a training plan workout or a custom workout they may choose to engage in a free workout. A free workout may refer to a situation where no plan or custom performance goals are provided and thus where voice coaching is entirely absent during the activity. Because voice coaching is entirely absent voice coaching options are not presented prior to beginning a free workout. After the athlete desiring to partake in a free workout has made their selections regarding any available options in response to prompts from the workout selection sub module the workout recording sub module of the go module may initiate the free workout and begin recording.

In one embodiment of the present invention instead of selecting a training plan custom or free workout when presented with the option via a GUI window such as that depicted in the athlete may be able to select an assessment workout. An assessment workout may be used by the fitness monitoring system to assess the relative fitness level of the athlete and or to establish or modify the athlete s performance zones for one or more parameters e.g. pace speed or heart rate zones as disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 467 948 titled Portable Fitness Monitoring Systems with Displays and Applications Thereof which has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As illustrated in in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may provide instructions for conducting the assessment workout to the athlete may begin the assessment workout may monitor the athlete s performance and may end the assessment workout.

For example during an assessment workout the athlete may be prompted to for example run as fast as possible for two minutes. The portable fitness monitoring device would then be capable of measuring or estimating the athlete s maximum heart rate or maximum speed based on the actual heart rate or speeds detected during the assessment exercise.

Alternatively the assessment workout may prompt the athlete to for example run at certain percentages of their maximum speed for set periods of time as subjectively estimated by the athlete . For example the assessment workout may prompt the athlete to try to consistently run at 50 75 and 100 of their maximum speed for consecutive 1 minute periods.

This information in turn could be used alone or in combination with personal information such as the athlete s age height weight and or sex to establish or modify the athlete s performance zones for one or more parameters. is an exemplary GUI window that may be provided by the workout selection sub module of the go module after the athlete has conducted their assessment workout and pace speed and or heart rate performance zones have been established or modified. In an embodiment different zone ranges may be provided for different activities such as running or biking.

In one embodiment of the present invention assessment workout performance information may be sent to the server which also may have access to personal information such as the athlete s age height weight and or sex for processing and calculation of the performance zones. In another embodiment such processing may be done by a processor of the portable fitness monitoring device .

After the athlete desiring to partake in a training plan custom free or assessment workout has made their selections regarding any available options in response to prompts from the workout selection sub module the workout recording sub module of the go module may initiate the workout and begin recording.

Prior to beginning a training plan custom free or assessment workout the athlete may position the portable fitness monitoring device . The portable fitness monitoring device may be worn carried or otherwise supported by the athlete during the physical activity. The portable fitness monitoring device may also attach to a piece of exercise equipment such as a road bike traveling on a bike path or a stationary bike in the gym. If necessary one or more sensors not integrally connected to or included within the portable fitness monitoring device that communicate with the portable fitness monitoring device may also need to be worn carried or otherwise supported by the athlete .

As shown in and as described above a header may be present near one of the edges of a GUI windows. In addition message section may also be present. In the message section presents the track name and artist name corresponding to the music track the athlete is currently listening to. In other embodiments the message section may present coaching encouragement or other messages provided by the portable fitness monitoring service software or provided by a coach or friend in real time for example via a text message.

Because are representative of a situation where the workout routine includes color coded zone intervals a progress bar may be displayed. The progress bar may be similar to the zone bar indicator that may be associated with a particular workout routine as described above. In addition to displaying the various color coded zone intervals of the present workout the progress bar may also include a moving progress mark indicative of where the athlete presently is in their zone based workout. For example the progress mark in indicates that the athlete presently is in the third color coded zone interval of their workout which may be a blue zone. The progress mark may move along the progress bar as the athlete progresses through the workout and as the workout routine is executed. In addition a cumulative workout total such as for example total workout time or total workout distance maybe displayed. In a total workout time of 16 minutes and 1 second is displayed.

Furthermore because are representative of a situation where the athlete is conducting a workout that includes at least one color coded zone goal a dynamic target bar may be displayed. The dynamic target bar may include a left portion and a right portion. The right portion may correspond to the present color coded zone goal for the athlete based on the current workout routine. The left portion may correspond to the athlete s presently detected and or measured performance information as it relates to the present workout routine color coded zone goal. For example in the right portion of the dynamic target bar may display a speed range of 7.0 miles per hour to 6.0 miles per hour which may correspond to a blue zone. The left portion of the dynamic target bar may display a current athlete speed of 8.2 miles per hour which may correspond to a yellow zone. Because the athlete is currently exercising at a higher intensity e.g. yellow vs. blue that their current workout routine calls for the dynamic target bar may provide an indication to the athlete that they need to decrease their intensity. For example as illustrated in the left portion of the dynamic target bar may be raised above the right portion and may include a down arrow indicating that the athlete should decrease their intensity.

As described in further detail elsewhere various color coded zone based systems may be employed and zones may be based on a variety of other parameters besides speed. In addition if the athlete has selected active coaching via the workout selection sub module of the go module the portable fitness monitoring device may provide audible feedback to complement or replace the visual feedback provided by the dynamic target bar . For example in the situation described above and depicted in the portable fitness monitoring device may announce your intensity is at a yellow zone level decrease your intensity to enter the blue zone. 

As indicated above during execution of a workout routine the athlete may toggle between screens corresponding to by manipulating the appropriate user input controls . In contrast to the GUI of the GUI of presents summary numerical information for multiple performance parameters but does not include either a progress bar or a dynamic target bar . For example in elapsed time total calories burned total distance traversed and average speed are presented.

While illustrates a dynamic target bar in a situation where the athlete s intensity is too high similar GUI elements may be presented by workout recording sub module of the go module to indicate that the athlete s intensity is either correct or too low. For example illustrate dynamic target bars in situations where the athlete s pace is too low too high and correct respectively. Each of indicate that the target pace range is between seven and eight minutes per mile which may correspond to a green zone. Thus the right portion of the dynamic target bars may be green. In the left portion of the dynamic target bar may be blue to represent a slow pace in the left portion of the dynamic target bar may be yellow to represent a fast pace and in the left portion of the dynamic target bar may be green to represent a correct pace.

For example in the progress bar may include a black region that will advance from left to right across the progress bar that represents the athlete s elapsed time in progress to achieving a total time goal. As illustrated in a stopwatch icon to the left of the progress bar may indicate the to athlete that elapsed time is the variable tracked by the progress bar . On the other hand in the progress bar may include a black region that will advance from left to right across the progress bar that represents the athlete s distance traversed in progress to achieving a total distance goal. As illustrated in a road icon to the left of the progress bar may indicate the to athlete that distance traversed is the variable tracked by the progress bar . In both the embodiments of a total elapsed time of 16 minutes and 48 seconds is displayed.

In some embodiments of the present invention if an athlete is conducting a free workout as described above similar GUI interfaces as those depicted in may still be displayed. In other embodiments an athlete is conducting a free workout such GUI interfaces may not be displayed.

As indicated above a header may be present near one of the edges of a GUI window of the present invention. In an embodiment while the athlete is conducting and recording a workout the header may include a map icon and or a music icon as illustrated in .

During a workout the athlete may desire to obtain an indication of their present location with respect to a map. Upon actuating the map icon illustrated in using the user input controls the workout recording sub module of the go module may present a GUI window such as that illustrated in which includes a visual indication of the present location of the athlete on a map. Location information for the athlete may be based in part on location signals received by the positioning system receiver e.g. a GPS receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device .

During the workout the athlete may also desire to view the presently selected music playlist and or select a different music track. Upon actuating the music icon illustrated in using the user input controls the workout recording sub module of the go module may present a GUI window such as that illustrated in which includes an interface for viewing the presently selected music playlist and or selecting a different music track such as those interfaces known by those of skill in the art.

In an embodiment of the present invention throughout the course of the workout the athlete may be able to pause the workout to temporarily cease performance parameter information recording. The athlete may also be able to end the workout before the goal s of the workout have been entirely met.

While the visual and tactile interaction with the system of the present invention has been described above primarily in the context of the display screen and user input controls of the portable fitness monitoring device in an embodiment at least some of the visual and tactile interaction between the athlete and the system may occur via a wristband or wrist watch such as those described above with reference to .

For example a wristband may be capable of displaying performance parameter information in a graphical or numerical way or color coded performance zone related information. In one embodiment the wristband may be capable of displaying performance parameter information in a graphical or numerical way such as for example a numerical heart rate number on a seven segment LCD display. In another embodiment a color emitted by the wristband that corresponds to a particular pace speed or heart rate zone may change in character in response to changes in the measured pace speed or heart rate occurring within the zone. It may also be possible to use the wristband to receive alerts control music functions or to pause workout recording. Other visual and tactile interactions between the athlete and the system of the present invention using a wristband or wristwatch may be possible such as those interactions disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 467 948 titled Portable Fitness Monitoring Systems with Displays and Applications Thereof which has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In one embodiment the athlete may use the user input controls of the portable fitness monitoring device or the user input controls of the wristband to annotate a location on their route as the athlete is traversing the route. For example when the athlete actuates a particular button the portable fitness monitoring device may annotate the data record associated with a GPS waypoint associated with the athlete s location at the time of the actuation. In another embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be capable of receiving input from a microphone so that the athlete may audibly annotate a location on their route as the athlete is traversing the route. Such annotations may be useful for example for logging the location of points of interest or experiences. For example the athlete may record voice annotations such as there s a water fountain here or this point in the hill is challenging. In a further embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be capable of receiving input from a keyboard or taking a photo or a video clip to annotate a location on their route as the athlete is traversing the route.

When the athlete completes the workout or chooses to end the workout early the workout recording sub module of the go module may prompt the athlete to save or discard the recorded performance information associated with the workout. If the athlete decides to save their recorded performance information a summary of their performance may be displayed.

In an embodiment of the present invention the athlete may choose to conduct a workout without the use of a positioning system receiver. In other embodiments of the present invention the athlete may choose to conduct a workout without the use of other portable sensors such as a portable heart rate monitor or a portable pedometer. In embodiments where certain information has not been recorded by portable sensors but the athlete is still able to record or otherwise calculate these parameters via alternative means the workout recording sub module may prompt the athlete to enter the missing information to complete the workout summary information. For example an athlete may chose to run indoors on a treadmill without using a GPS receiver or other portable sensors capable of providing time distance pace heart rate and or calorie information. However if the treadmill itself provides measured calculated or estimate values for these parameters that are displayed to the athlete the athlete may manually enter them into the portable fitness monitoring device . In another embodiment the measured calculated or estimate values may automatically be transmitted to the portable fitness monitoring device . Measured calculated or estimate values for at least one type of parameter may be necessary if the athlete is executing a workout routine that is based upon one or more color coded zones based upon that parameter. For example if the athlete is conducting a pace zone based workout while running on a treadmill the treadmill or a sensor worn by the athlete must be capable of providing feedback regarding the athlete s pace.

After reviewing summary information either provided by the portable fitness monitoring device or manually entered by the athlete the athlete may be provided with several other options by the portable fitness monitoring device . In one embodiment as illustrated by the athlete may be asked to rate the workout that they just completed as described in further detail below. For example the athlete may be able to assign a subjective rating to the workout on a one to five star scale with more stars corresponding to a better rating.

In another embodiment as illustrated in the athlete may be able to associate one or more notes with the workout they just completed as described in further detail below. For example the athlete may be able to select from one or more default note options such as those listed in . Alternatively as illustrated in the athlete may be able to enter their own custom note for the workout using the appropriate user interface controls of the portable fitness monitoring device . In yet another embodiment the athlete may be able to associate a photo or a video clip with the workout they just completed.

In one embodiment of the present invention the athlete may be able to associate a particular activity type with the record of the workout. For example the athlete may be able to indicate that he had just engaged in for example walking running cycling cross country skiing inline skating. For planned workouts for particular types of activities the type of activity may automatically be associated with the record of the workout. However because free workouts may not be associated with a particular type of activity ahead of time it may be necessary for the athlete to manually make the association. Association of a particular activity type with the record of the workout may advantageously allow for more precise data analysis feedback and coaching based on the particular type of activity.

In a further embodiment the athlete may be able to associate a particular pair of shoes that the athlete wore during the workout with the record of the workout. In one embodiment after an appropriate prompt from the track module software application module the athlete may manually associate a particular pair of shoes with the workout using the user interface controls of the portable fitness monitoring device . In another embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be able to automatically detect which pair of shoes were being worn during the activity by detecting the presence of an identifier in one or both of the shoes such as a specific radio frequency identification RFID chip in one or both of the shoes.

As is known by those of skill in the art passive RFID systems work by employing a reader and a chip. A scanning antenna of the reader emits radio frequency signals in a relatively short range. These radio frequency signals communicate with the RFID chip and provide the chip with the energy to engage in the communication. When an RFID chip passes through the field of the scanning antenna of the reader the chip detects the activation signal from the antenna wakes up and it transmits the information stored on the chip to be picked up by the reader. Thus in the context of embodiments of the present invention a RFID chip in a particular shoe or pair of shoes may be able to communicate information with a nearby portable fitness monitoring device .

As described in further detail below at a later time a listing of each pair of shoes the athlete has associated with one or more workouts along with a cumulative distance that the athlete has traversed while wearing each pair of shoes may be presented. Athletes may advantageously use this information to determine when a particular pair may need to be replaced or to determine how particular pairs of shoes have affected the athlete s performance.

After reviewing summary information and after annotating the workout record with any additional information as described above the portable fitness monitoring device may either save the complete workout record locally or transmit it to the server as described in further detail elsewhere.

In one embodiment upon successful upload of a complete workout record to the server the portable fitness monitoring device may prompt the athlete to view more detailed analytical information about the athlete s performance during the workout. As illustrated in the workout recording sub module of the go module may present a GUI window that provides encouragement or other feedback to the athlete along with the option to review the detailed analytical information. If the athlete opts to review the detailed analytical information they may be presented with a GUI window similar to that depicted in by track module as described in further detail below.

The various steps taken by the workout recording sub module of the go module of the application software of one embodiment of the present invention may be summarized by the flow chart of . At step the workout recording sub module initiates recording of performance information by the portable fitness monitoring device . At step the workout recording sub module initiates saving of the performance information by the portable fitness monitoring device . At step the workout recording sub module presents a performance information summary to the athlete . At steps the workout recording sub module presents rating note and shoe tracking options to the athlete . At step the workout recording sub module initiates the sending of the workout performance information to the server . Finally at step the workout recording sub module initiates the receiving of the detailed analytical information about the workout from the server .

In some embodiments of the present invention after the athlete has engaged in a physical activity a user who may or may not be the athlete may access a website provided by the server from a remotely located personal computer to review detailed analytical information about the athlete s activity. As previously explained the personal computer may be for example a desktop laptop or tablet computer.

However as described above in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device itself may also serve as the personal computer . Thus for example the athlete maybe able to review detailed analytical information about the activity from the portable fitness monitoring device itself after the athlete has engaged in a physical activity. While the description that follows primarily describes the presentation of detailed analytical information in the context of presentation from the server to a user stationed at a personal computer such as a desktop laptop or tablet computer information may also be presented via the portable fitness monitoring device itself to the athlete . Thus while figures of exemplary GUIs suitable at least for display on a personal computer such as a desktop computer are provided these figures are supplemented with exemplary GUIs suitable at least for display on a portable fitness monitoring device .

As explained above with reference to the application software of the server may include a number of different modules capable of providing fitness monitoring services to athletes . In one embodiment of the present invention these modules include a track module . The track module allows the users to review and analyze an athlete s past performance data. After completing a workout and uploading performance data to the server the athlete may log in to the server to review and analyze their past performance data.

In one embodiment for each completed workout routine a workout journal page may list the date the workout was completed the name of the workout and one or more performance details about the workout. For example the workout journal page may list the elapsed time of the workout the calories burned during the workout the distance covered during the workout the athlete s average heart rate during the workout the athlete s average pace during the workout the athlete s average stride rate during the workout a subjective athlete rating of the workout and or route an automatic computer rating of the workout and or route the type of activity the athlete conducted and any other notes the athlete wishes to record. The particular information displayed on the workout journal page may be set by the system or customized by the user.

As described above with reference to the subjective rating may be assigned by the athlete immediately after the workout is completed or at a later time. In one embodiment the athlete may rate a workout on a one to five star scale with a one star workout being a poor workout and a five star workout being an excellent workout. In one embodiment the athlete rating may be entirely subjective. Alternatively the rating may be assigned by track module objectively based on various recorded performance parameters from the workout historical athlete performance and or user settings and options. For example an objective route difficulty rating may be assigned to the workout based on one or more of route length elevation changes over the route altitude of the route temperature during the athletic performance humidity during the athletic performance wind speed during the athletic performance and wind direction during the athletic performance.

The athlete notes may also be assigned by the athlete immediately after the workout is complete as described above with reference to or at a later time. Athlete notes may include for example explanations of a rating assigned to the workout or other subjective or objective observations about the workout the athlete s condition the environment the workout was conducted in or the route traversed.

In addition to or in place of being able to review and analyze past performance data via the workout journal page the user may be able to select an icon capable of initiating a history sub module. The history sub module of the application software may be capable of displaying a variety of GUI windows to the user such as for example those shown in .

The information displayed on the history pages may be for a single workout or for a plurality of workouts falling within a particular date range. Information may be displayed on a yearly monthly weekly or daily basis. The data range selected by the user may affect the information displayed by the dashboard icons the information displayed on the primary display as well as the content of the sidebar .

The dashboard shown in includes display icons for time calories distance heart rate pace and stride rate. In an embodiment a display icon for total elevational ascent may also be provided. The numerical information provided with the dashboard icons corresponds to data associated with workouts from the date range selected. For example as illustrated in for the selected period of Jul. 27 2008 through Aug. 16 2008 the user s total workout time was 52 hours 52 minutes and 16 seconds. This value may also be provided in cumulative and or average form over the selected time period.

While the information provided by the dashboard icons may remain the same for a given date range the information displayed by the primary display may change depending on which dashboard icon the user has selected. For example in because the user has selected the heart rate icon in the dashboard the history sub module displays heart rate information in the primary display .

While shows the information displayed by the primary display in the form of bar graphs other suitable graphical displays such as for example line graphs pie graphs race course representations animations or videos may be provided in addition to or in place of the bar graphs. Moreover although only heart rate graphs have been illustrated by any performance parameters listed in the dashboard may be graphically displayed in the primary display . For example illustrates an exemplary history page where pace information is displayed in the primary display in bar graph form.

As shown in when daily heart rate information is displayed in the primary display in bar graph form the heart rate information may be conveyed based on the color coded heart rate zone system described above with respect to . When daily weekly or monthly pace stride rate or other parameter information is displayed in the primary display in bar graph form this information may or may not be conveyed based on a color coded zone system corresponding to these other parameters.

As shown in while only pace information is displayed in the primary display in bar graph form other performance parameter information may be overlaid in bar graph form. For example a heart rate bar graph may be overlaid or placed next to of the pace based graph so that both parameters could be compared.

In one embodiment an athlete who wishes to obtain even more specific information about a period of time displayed within the primary display may select the bar or other indicium representing the appropriate time period with their cursor e.g. by clicking on the bar or other indicium . For example if the user viewing the daily GUI window of wanted to obtain more specific information about workouts conducted on Aug. 9 2008 the user could select the bar representing that day which may result in the history sub module displaying the daily GUI window shown in .

The history display shown in is similar to the display shown in in that the dashboard primary display and sidebar are still present. However differs from in that information provided in both the dashboard and the primary display is only associated with a single workout day. Additional functionality may also provided by the sidebar .

Similarly the history display shown in is similar to the display shown in except that illustrates an exemplary history page where pace information is displayed instead of heart rate information.

In one embodiment of the present invention as shown in the history sub module may provide a feedback section in the sidebar . The feedback section may provide feedback from coaches friends or other users authorized to provide feedback to the athlete . All users of the system of the present invention having similar accounts through server may be authorized to provide feedback to the athlete . Alternatively only users of the system that are specifically authorized by the athlete may provide feedback to the athlete . In an embodiment users who are linked to the athlete via a social networking site may also provide feedback to the athlete . Feedback may be provided through a GUI provided by sever via email via text message via voice mail or by any other suitable means known in the art. Feedback may be listed sequentially in the order that the feedback was posted much like comments associated with a blog entry or other web article as is known by those of skill in the art.

The history sub module may also provide a notes section in the sidebar . The notes section may provide a section for a user rating and user notes. These ratings and notes may be similar to those described above with reference to and .

The history sub module may provide a route tools section in the sidebar that may be managed by a route tools software application sub module as described in further detail below.

In another embodiment of the present invention the history sub module may further provide a playlist section in the sidebar . If the athlete conducted a workout while listening to music on a music enabled portable fitness monitoring device the playlist section may provide a listing of the musical audio tracks that the athlete listened to during their workout.

In an embodiment a particular play list may be associated with a particular route plan or workout routine so that the play list may be downloaded to the portable fitness monitoring device simultaneously with the route plan and or workout routine. Accordingly the athlete may be able to easily execute the same or substantially the same workout routine and or traverse the same route while listening to the same play list. The athlete could also fine tune their play list until the athlete felt that the play list provided appropriate entertainment motivation or other benefits during the physical activity.

In one embodiment the performance information to be displayed in the primary display based on the selected dashboard icon may be displayed on a line graph whose x axis is either time or distance based and whose y axis is correlated to the value of the measured performance parameter. For example as shown in a line graph charts heart rate information as a function of time during the workout. In a line graph charts pace information as a function of time during the workout.

Average lines may also be plotted parallel to the x axis across the graphs. For example in an average heart rate line representing the athlete s average heart rate of 155 beats per minute during the workout is plotted across the graph.

A user interested in viewing instantaneous performance statistics over the course of the workout may be able to select and drag a scrollbar with a cursor along the x axis. As the user drags the scrollbar across the x axis an icon may travel along the line graph plotted for the performance parameter of interest. In addition a pop up window displaying additional instantaneous performance data may appear and move across the screen along with the moving icon. is an illustration of an icon and pop up window containing instantaneous performance parameter information being moved across a GUI screen by means of a scrollbar .

In an embodiment the user may be able to manually correct any recorded parameters that they know are inaccurate. Inaccuracies may be due to for example errors with the sensors employed by the portable fitness monitoring device used by the athlete . A user may correct for example the distance the athlete traveled during a workout. The user may know the exact distance of a route routinely traveled and wish to update a distance inaccurately recorded by a distance sensor .

In another embodiment when a parameter such as distance is corrected the system may recalibrate the recorded and stored data. For example when the distance traversed for a particular activity is corrected the distance data and corresponding distance graph for that activity is corrected. In addition data and graphical displays that depend on the distance data such as pace data and graphical displays are also corrected.

In a further embodiment when a parameter such as distance is corrected this corrected data may be transmitted to the portable fitness monitoring device the next time the device is in communication with the network so that the portable fitness monitoring device s distance monitoring capability can be recalibrated if necessary.

While these tracking features have been described primarily in the context of presentation from the server to a user stationed at a personal computer such as a desktop laptop or tablet computer in an embodiment of the present invention GUIs providing information and functionalities similar to those provided by the GUIs depicted in may be provided to the athlete via the portable fitness monitoring device such as a smart phone.

For example is an illustration of a home page GUI displayed via the portable fitness monitoring device where the athlete has highlighted an icon corresponding to the track module application software module. The track module may include a workout history sub module an achievements sub module and a shoes sub module. As explained in further detail below certain aspects of the workout history sub module of the track module of the portable fitness monitoring device may be similar to aspects of the history sub module of the track module of the server as described above.

After the athlete selects the icon corresponding to the track module the track module my present the athlete with the option of receiving additional information regarding workout histories achievements or shoes as illustrated in . When the athlete indicates that they would like to receive additional information regarding workout histories the workout history sub module may present a GUI such as the exemplary GUI window shown in .

If the athlete requests additional information regarding other notes information that the athlete entered in response to the prompts described above at steps and of regarding general notes and shoes may be provided.

Returning to the presentation of information from the server to a user stationed at a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop computer in an embodiment of the present invention graphical representations of the routes traversed by the athlete during individual workouts may be presented to the user. As described above the history sub module of the track module of the server may be capable of presenting a route tools section in a sidebar that may be managed by a route tools sub module.

In one embodiment the route tools sub module may allow the user to associate specific routes with a workout when the workout involved the traversal of a particular geographic pathway. In one embodiment the route tools sub module may employ a web based mapping service application such as for example the Google Maps application provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif. The mapping service application may utilize an application programming interface that allows the mapping service application such as Google Maps to be embedded into the GUI windows of the present invention.

In one embodiment the route tools sub module may enable the user to recreate the path traversed by the athlete during the workout by clicking and or dragging and dropping landmarks and paths over a street map using a cursor. The approximate area of the route may be found by for example entering a street address a well known landmark or a zip code into the mapping service application interface. Alternatively in an embodiment as illustrated in the athlete could conduct their workout using a GPS enabled portable fitness monitoring device capable of recording their geographic way points along the route traversed. Either during traversal of the route or after the route has been completed the GPS data could then be uploaded to the server and associated with other performance monitoring information collected during traversal of the route. Thus the route tools sub module could automatically reconstruct the path traversed by the athlete . In an embodiment as illustrated in an route details box may provide summary information about the route such as for example distance rating creation date location comments notes and or other relevant information.

In one embodiment a user interested in viewing instantaneous performance statistics throughout the workout may be able to select and drag a scrollbar with their cursor along the x axis. As the user drags the scrollbar across the x axis an icon may travel along the route path plotted. In addition a pop up window displaying additional instantaneous performance data may appear and move across the screen along with the moving icon . is an illustration of an icon and pop up window containing instantaneous performance parameter information being moved across a GUI screen by means of a scrollbar . Thus scrollbar may function in a similar way to scrollbar described above. In an embodiment the scrollbar and or the icon may take the form of an active figure such as a runner. In one embodiment the user may be able to customize the images used for the scrollbar and or the icon such as for example replacing the default icon with a personal avatar or other desired image.

As illustrated in in another embodiment the user may be provided with a route view in which multiple performance parameters are concurrently graphically presented in a banded format along a route path. Like the embodiments of the user s route path may be overlaid on a map and performance parameters may be associated with particular points along the route. In contrast the embodiments of however the route path may comprise a plurality of bands each of which represents a performance parameter quantified at the GPS waypoints recorded along the route.

In an embodiment the value of the respective performance parameter may be charted along route path utilizing color shade variation to represent the instantaneous quantity of the performance parameter at each point along the route. Thus in the different hatching applied to each of the inner band middle band and outer band represents a different color and a varying spacing between the hatches represents the display of the colors at varying levels of intensity along the route path depending upon the value of the parameters at each point along the path. The value associated with each shade of color is generally graphically represented in an accompanying legend .

In one embodiment instantaneous performance parameter data at any point along the route path is presented in response to hovering over the point with a cursor or in response to the user actuating a scrollbar such as scrollbar described above with respect to .

A user may be able to manually add markers to locations along the route path. In one embodiment after the user adds two markers at two different locations along the route path the user may be able to lock the markers. When markers are locked actuating the scrollbar may cause synchronized movement of the markers. Synchronized movement may refer to a situation where each of the markers advances a set number of GPS waypoints in response to a particular actuation of the scrollbar . In this manner the user may be able to graphically and intuitively define an interval over which performance parameter information may be viewed. For example a pop up window displaying performance information corresponding to the interval defined by the two markers may appear and move across the screen along with the scrollbar .

In one embodiment of the present invention the route map may display the location of annotations provided by the athlete during the route as previously described. Various icons or symbols corresponding to the locations of the annotations may be selected by the user. In the case of audio annotations the user may click on or otherwise select an icon corresponding to the location of the audio annotation to play the audio annotation back to the user. Likewise for photo or video based annotations the user may click on or otherwise select the appropriate icon to play the video clip or display the photo.

In another embodiment in addition to or instead of allowing athletes to annotate a route during the activity the user may be able to add annotations to the route while reviewing it after the activity has been completed. Based on the user s knowledge of the route the user may add annotations corresponding to the locations of for example drinking fountains bathrooms or other interesting features along the route. These annotations may consist of text symbols audio recordings video clips and or photos.

In an embodiment the user may be able to manually correct any recorded GPS data that they know is inaccurate. Inaccuracies may be due to for example GPS receiver timing positional and or other errors such as those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 569 492 titled Program Products Methods and Systems for Providing Location Aware Fitness Monitoring Services which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In embodiments where a predetermined route was assigned to the workout prior to undertaking the activity as described above with reference to the route module may have had access to an elevation database to obtain elevation corresponding to a particular route. This information may be used to supply elevation information for the route when conducting post workout analysis. Accordingly the elevation information supplied by the route module may be able to assist or replace any elevation information provided by positioning system receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device . Thus in the case of a GPS system if less than four GPS satellites are acquired or if the GPS receiver is not designed to process elevation information the portable fitness monitoring device can still determine elevation dependent route and performance data regarding a route traversed by athlete . Even if the route module did not have had access to an elevation database prior to the workout such a database may be accessed after the workout to supply the necessary information.

In another embodiment the route tools sub module of the application software may allow the athlete to create store share and find route plans of interest. The route plan which may or may not be associated with a particular workout routine may be created or selected that specifies a particular route for the athlete to travel. In an embodiment the route plan may be downloaded to the portable fitness monitoring device . Athletes may use route plans they themselves have created and stored on the sever . In one embodiment other users may post and share route plans with others via the server . Thus a plurality of users may be able to create store share find edit rate and comment on route plans of interest.

In one embodiment the user may save and name a route or route plan using the route tools sub module. In the embodiment of as shown in the sidebar the user has named and saved a plurality of routes or route plans to the server . In the event that a particular route or route plan has not been automatically assigned to a given workout record the user may wish to select a route or route plan with the cursor to associate with their workout.

Saved routes or route plans may be displayed in primary display if the user selects an appropriate icon. Route details such as the route name distance and location may be provided in a route details box GUI pop up window. The user may also be able to assign a subjective rating and include notes about the route. These features may be analogous to the user rating and user notes features described above.

While these route related features have been described primarily in the context of presentation from the server to a user stationed at a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop computer in an embodiment of the present invention GUIs providing information and functionalities similar to those provided by the GUIs depicted in may be provided to the athlete via the portable fitness monitoring device .

For example is an exemplary GUI window according to an embodiment of the present invention that may be displayed when the athlete carrying a portable fitness monitoring device selects an individual workout from a workout list such as that depicted in . As illustrated in a drop down menu may be provided that allows the athlete to request additional information regarding routes.

In one embodiment a route map similar to that illustrated in may be presented. In another embodiment route map presented may convey information similar to that conveyed by the route map of but the route map may be relatively less complex and more suitable for a smaller display screen of a portable fitness monitoring device .

In one embodiment athletes using portable fitness monitoring devices may share routes directly between their devices i.e. not via the route selection feature of the website as described above . For example one athlete may send a route to another athlete via a text message or email message regardless of the athletes locations. Alternatively if the athletes and their portable fitness monitoring devices are in close proximity to one another they may be able to share routes via WPAN transceivers and or infrared transmission systems. Thus an athlete may share a favorite route with a friend.

Other route related functionalities may be supported by the application software of the server for use with the portable fitness monitoring services of the present invention. For example in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be able to guide the athlete along a route based on the route plan and for example the athlete s current position based on GPS readings. For example as the athlete is traversing a route the portable fitness monitoring device may audibly or visually command the athlete to turn right in 10 meters or turn right on Main St. 

In another embodiment the route related functionalities of the server may be utilized to support the live tracking options described above. Live tracking refers to the ability of a remote user other than the athlete to track the athlete s location in substantially real time during the activity. As explained in further detail elsewhere in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may be able to wirelessly communicate location based information to the server via the network in real time via the WWAN or WPAN transceiver. Thus users with access to this data on the server may be able to view the athlete s location for example superimposed on a map. In an embodiment as depicted in a plurality of athletes competing in a race and each utilizing GPS enabled portable fitness monitoring devices may be tracked in substantially real time and their positions and may be superimposed over a route on a map. Users may be able to hover over or otherwise select an icon associated with a particular athlete such as icon and display an information box that displays current performance parameter information for that athlete .

Returning to the presentation of information from the server to a user stationed at a personal computer such as a desktop laptop or tablet computer in an embodiment of the present invention summary information about the athlete s workouts and training program may be presented to the user.

More specifically the track module of the application software of the server may provide a front page sub module. is an exemplary GUI window that may be displayed by the front page sub module to a user stationed at a personal computer . The front page GUI may include plan tracker lifetime stats last workout next workout and coach talk sections. In an embodiment the contents of the front page may be customized and reordered similarly to customizable web portals such as for example the iGoogle web portal provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif.

The lifetime stats section may provide text and or icons that are correlated to particular cumulative or average lifetime performance parameters. In this way information displayed by the lifetime stats section on the front page may be somewhat similar to information displayed by the dashboard of the other history pages. The particular information displayed in the lifetime stats section may be set by the system or customized by the user. Various information may be added or removed by the user as desired.

In an embodiment the last workout section displays stats for the last workout completed by the athlete and the next workout section displays information about upcoming planned workouts. The information provided by the lifetime stats last workout and next workout sections may be similar to information provided to the user by other modules and sub modules but may conveniently be provided on a single page. The coach talk section may provide motivation point out a particular area of focus or otherwise provide guidance to the athlete related to the ultimate goal of their particular plan or workout.

In one embodiment the front page includes a plan tracker section. The plan tracker may graphically display an athlete s planned workouts the number of planned workouts completed and the number of planned workouts remaining to be completed. For example as shown in the plan tracker could include a series of icons or hash marks that are each representative of an individual workout. Completed and uncompleted workouts maybe differentiated by color coding shading or other visual indicia. The plan tracker may provide indication s about whether the athlete is meeting the specified goals for the completed workouts.

The particular information displayed in the plan tracker section may be set by the system or customized by the user. Various information may be added or removed by the user as desired. An athlete engaged in multiple plans simultaneously e.g. a running based plan and a non running based plan may choose to display multiple plan trackers at once.

A zone bar indicator such as those described above and those depicted in may also be provided.

In one embodiment in response to the coach clicking on one of the various graphical elements of the dashboard the coaching group module may provide the coach with a GUI that includes more detailed information about an individual athlete s workout such as a GUI similar to those capable of being provided by the history sub module of the track module as depicted in . In this way the coach may review and analyze the athlete s workout performance in greater detail. In an embodiment the athlete may adjust their coaching group setting so that the coach has limited access to certain portions of their athletic performance data.

In another embodiment in response to the coach clicking on for example the athlete s name or an icon corresponding to the athlete s next scheduled workout the coaching group module may provide the coach with a GUI that includes a calendar of the athlete s scheduled workouts such as a GUI similar to those capable of being provided by the schedule module as depicted in .

With regard to the planning and scheduling aspects of the coaching group features of embodiments of the present invention a coach may have different levels of involvement in the providing workouts for the member athletes .

In one embodiment the coach may have the authority to select a training plan and schedule the plan workouts of the training plan on the athlete s calendar as described above with respect to . In another embodiment of the present invention the coach may have the authority to build select and or schedule custom workouts on the athlete s calendar as described above with respect to .

Workout routines associated with the scheduled workouts may be sent to the athlete s portable fitness monitoring device prior to the athlete engaging in the workout as described above.

As a specific example of an embodiment of the present invention an athlete may be granted access to a general account with the fitness monitoring service described above. Among other things the fitness monitoring service may be capable of maintaining a schedule of workouts for the athlete to complete in association with the account. This may be accomplished for example using the plan module and schedule module software application modules as described above.

The athlete may chose to join a coaching group that was set up by a coach in the coaches own account utilizing the coaching group module. Once the coach and athlete s accounts are linked the coach may be able to provide a new workout for the athlete . When the system receives that new workout from the coach the new workout may be added to the schedule of the athlete s workouts. Then at the appropriate time a workout routine corresponding to the new workout may be sent to the athlete s portable fitness monitoring device such as a mobile phone. After the athlete completes the workout the portable fitness monitoring device may send athletic performance information associated with the workout back to the server for additional processing.

In one embodiment the coach may be able to provide the new workout for the athlete by interacting with a GUI that includes a graphical representation of the athlete s schedule of workouts such as a workout calendar . The coach may associate the new workout with particular day on the athlete s calendar. For example in an embodiment the coach may select an icon corresponding to a custom workout from a GUI sidebar and drag the custom workout icon to another icon representing a particular day on the calendar . The system thus schedules the new workout on the athlete s calendar for the athlete to complete at a later date.

As described in detail above the new workout may have a performance parameter target such as for example a target time distance speed pace and or heart rate. The workout may consist of a series of intervals each having a target intensity such a target speed pace and or heart rate. In an embodiment as described above the target intensity may be a range of intensities or a zone such as the color coded zones described above with reference to .

As described in detail above in one embodiment of the present invention the fitness monitoring system may utilize an assessment workout to assess the relative fitness level of the athlete and or to establish or modify the athlete s performance zones for one or more parameters. This feature may be enabled by the go module of the portable fitness monitoring device and or the support module of the server .

As illustrated in the application software of server may include an assessment workout module . Among other things the assessment workout module may be capable of generating workout routines for athletes who have not yet created an account with the fitness monitoring service.

An athlete who possesses a portable fitness monitoring device such as a mobile phone may be interested in testing out fitness monitoring services such as those described according to embodiments of the present invention. However the athlete may be reluctant to sign up for an account with the fitness monitoring service via a website. In an embodiment of the present invention an athlete with a compatible portable fitness monitoring device such as a mobile phone may be able to test out the portable fitness monitoring service by utilizing their portable fitness monitoring device and providing the fitness monitoring service with minimal information but without initially creating an account with the fitness monitoring service.

In one embodiment the athlete may power on their portable fitness monitoring device if it is not already in a powered on state. In some embodiments it may be necessary for the athlete to manipulate user input controls to enter a portable fitness monitoring mode to access the application software. In other embodiments it may be necessary for the athlete to download the application software.

Upon launch of the portable fitness monitoring application the start module may prompt the athlete and determine whether the athlete wishes to proceed as a guest who does not have an account with the fitness monitoring service. If the athlete indicates via activation of the user input controls that the athlete does not have and or does not want to create an account with the fitness monitoring service the start module may present a personal information wizard that may allow the athlete to enter personal information such as for example the athlete s age the athlete s gender the athlete s weight and or the athlete s height. As explained in further detail above the personal information wizard may also allow the athlete to enter preferred unit preferences and or preferred voice training options.

As described above with respect to in an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may provide the athlete with instructions for conducting the assessment workout may begin the assessment workout may monitor the athlete s performance and may end the assessment workout.

For example verbal or visual instructions may be provided to the athlete that tell the athlete to run as fast as possible for two minutes. During the two minute activity the portable fitness monitoring device may measure and record performance information associated with the athlete such as for example the athlete s heart rate and or speed. In an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device may measure and record the athlete s maximum heart rate and or maximum speed during the activity.

Alternatively the assessment workout may prompt the athlete to for example run at certain percentages of their maximum speed for set periods of time as subjectively estimated by the athlete . For example the assessment workout may prompt the athlete to try to consistently run at 50 75 and 100 of their maximum speed for consecutive 1 minute periods. During this three minute activity the portable fitness monitoring device may measure and record performance information associated with the athlete such as for example the athlete s heart rate and or speed.

Upon completion of the specified activity the portable fitness monitoring device may transmit the performance information to the fitness monitoring service server as described in further detail elsewhere. Either before along with or after the transmission of the performance information from the portable fitness monitoring device to the server the athlete s personal information may also be transmitted to the server .

The assessment workout module of the application software of server may be capable of initiating several related actions as briefly outlined in the flow chart of . At step the server may receive the personal information associated with an athlete from the portable fitness monitoring device . Before along with or after step at step the server may also receive the performance information associated with the athlete from the portable fitness monitoring device . Next at step the workout module may generate a workout routine based on the personal information and the performance information. Finally at step the server may send the workout routine to the portable fitness monitoring device .

The workout module may be able to generate a workout routine using one of a variety of algorithms. In one embodiment one or more of the athlete s age gender weight and or height may be factored in to increase or decrease the difficulty of the workout routine. In another embodiment the athlete s heart rate pace and or speed information may be factored in to increase or decrease the difficulty of the workout routine. In some embodiments look up tables or performance parameter indices may be consulted.

Other factors may also go into the generation of a workout routine. In one embodiment the weather forecast for the region where the athlete is located or otherwise desires to conduct a workout could be factored in. For example if the forecast calls for very hot weather the intensity of the workout generated may be lowered. In another embodiment the athlete could indicate that they are training for an upcoming event such as a specific race. Accordingly the characteristics of the race route e.g. distance elevation difficulty etc. could be factored in to the generation of the workout routine.

In yet another embodiment to encourage the athlete to continue using the fitness monitoring in the future along with the workout routine the athlete may be provided with specific training tips and or contact information for local trainers or coaches in the athlete s area.

The workout routine may include one or more of a number of different goals as described with respect to plan and custom workouts elsewhere. For example the workout module may be able to generate a workout routine that includes a target time or a target distance. The workout module may also be able to generate a workout routine that includes a plurality of intervals where each interval has an intensity goal. The workout module may further be able to generate a workout routine where the intensity goal is for example heart rate distance pace or speed based.

In an embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device and the server may communicate information via a wireless network as described above. For example in one embodiment the portable fitness monitoring device is adapted to transmit personal and performance information and to receive the workout routine using a wireless transceiver as described above.

In a further embodiment the workout module may be capable of generating a workout based on the user s present location and or the weather conditions or forecast associated with the user s present or desired location. Location based information may be determined based on position information derived from a positioning system receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device as described above.

In some embodiments the workout module may generate multiple workout routines for an athlete based on a single assessment workout.

As described in detail above in one embodiment of the present invention the portable fitness monitoring device may include or communicate with one or more sensors for detecting information used to measure and or calculate performance parameters. In an embodiment shown in the portable fitness monitoring device itself may include a sensor .

In one embodiment a positioning system receiver such as that illustrated in may function as a sensor integrally coupled to the portable fitness monitoring device and may allow the portable fitness monitoring device to detecting information that may be used to measure and or calculate location distance traveled speed and or pace. The positioning system receiver may be for example a GPS or Galileo compatible receiver.

As the portable fitness monitoring device including the positioning system receiver is supported by the athlete during an activity the positioning system receiver may receive positioning system signals from positioning system satellites where each positioning system signal may contain a timestamp. From these positioning system signals the processor of the portable fitness monitoring device may compute a series of time stamped position points. These time stamped position points may be subject to at least two types of error namely timing error and positional error.

Timing error may be induced by a low performance processor driving the positioning system receiver that does not have sufficient cycles to dedicate to positioning system signal processing. Alternatively or additionally timing error may be inserted by the use of for example assisted GPS A GPS which requires round trip communication over a wireless network to validate a GPS reading or by local filtering performed by the positioning system receiver and or the processor .

Additional positional error may also be caused by the inherent positional error of commercial as opposed to military positioning system signals which in the case of GPS is typically between 3 5 meters. Consequently when the sampling rate of the positioning system signal causes more than one sample to be taken during time interval required for the athlete to traverse the positional error distance a zigzag positional route may be reported even if a relatively straight path was followed. This distance error may negatively impact any average or instantaneous speed or pace computations that depend on a correct reporting of distance traversed.

Accordingly positioning system based speed or pace calculations may be prone to these and other errors. In embodiments of the present invention that rely on positioning system based speed or pace calculations to provide real time coaching and or feedback as described above these errors can adversely affect the accuracy of the coaching and or feedback. For example some embodiments may provide feedback when the athlete has fallen outside of a desired speed or pace zone. If the portable fitness monitoring device can not accurately detect changes in speed or pace this feedback may be inaccurate.

As illustrated in the application software of the portable fitness monitoring device may include a positioning system smoothing module . Among other things the positioning system smoothing module may be capable of increasing the accuracy of positioning system based speed or pace detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback.

In one embodiment of the present invention the positioning system smoothing module may employ a buffer system to increase the accuracy of positioning system based speed or pace detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback.

For example the portable fitness processing device software may continually add GPS waypoints to the memory and the processor may continually calculate speed points based on the elapsed time and measured distance between consecutive waypoints. The software may then save a predetermined number of speed points in a speed buffer and may compare the values in the speed buffer to determine a weighted average speed.

Weighting factors may take into account how recently a value was added to the buffer and may assign a greater weight to more recent values. Weighting factors may also consider how much a recent value deviates from the current average.

Data may be added to the buffer as it is recorded and the buffer may build up until it reaches a predetermined size. When the buffer becomes full it may begin discarding the oldest data point each time a new data point is added.

In an embodiment these weighted average speeds may be the speeds that are displayed to the athlete while the athlete is using the portable fitness monitoring device that are wirelessly transmitted to the server and that are used for feedback and coaching.

A variety of methods may be employed to best determine accurate weighted average speeds. Those methods may include for example a standard average method a cumulative sum method a cluster average method a time weighted average method an inverse speed delta weighted average method an acceleration adjusted instant speed method or combinations of one or more of these methods.

Standard average methods may involve calculating mean speeds between two or more consecutive speed points. Cumulative sum methods may involve determining a cumulative sum of the deviation from a target value such as the sum of all the differences in speed from a particular speed reference point. The reference point could be for example the running standard average of speed values. As ongoing cumulative sum values are determined they may be analyzed by an algorithm to determine if a possible change in speed is valid or not. If the speed change is valid it is factored in and used to provide feedback and coaching. If the speed change is not valid it is ignored. Cluster average methods are similar to standard average methods but instead of averaging only consecutive speed points within the moving buffer speed points that occurred further apart in time are compared.

Time weighted average methods may take into account how recently a speed value was added to the buffer and may assign a greater weight to more recent speed values. A weighting coefficient can be determined by various means. For example in an inverse speed delta weighted average method the weighting coefficient may have the effect of weighting particular speed points less the further they are away from a particular reference value.

Acceleration adjusted instant speed methods may involve adjusting speed point values based on known real life human acceleration capabilities. In other words the point to point difference in instantaneous speed may be limited by a maximum known acceleration. For example the method may assume a maximum human runner s acceleration to be 1.0 miles per hour per second. Thus the system would limit a recorded and or output speed change of 10 miles per hour to a period of 10 seconds.

In one embodiment the positioning system smoothing module may employ a combination of the inverse speed delta weighted average and acceleration adjusted instant speed methods. For example instantaneous calculated speeds may first be adjusted using an acceleration adjustment formula and then the resulting values may be feed into an inverse speed delta weighted average formula.

In another embodiment of the present invention the GPS smoothing module may employ an additional method to increase the accuracy of GPS based speed and pace detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback.

In the above described scenario there may be significant lag time in reporting an updated speed of the athlete in real time during the activity. For example an athlete may be running at a speed of eight miles per hour when the portable fitness monitoring device informs the athlete that their workout routine calls for them to enter a new performance zone interval that will bring their speed up to ten miles per hour. Assuming the athlete quickly accelerates to ten miles per hour a significant amount of time may pass before the weighted average speed settles in around ten miles per hour because it may be weighted down with a plurality of eight mile per hour data points in the buffer.

As a result if an incorrect speed is output to the athlete and the athlete recognizes this the athlete may lose confidence in the accuracy of the system. Alternatively the athlete may attempt to speed up even more in response to observing a speed that appears too low even if the athlete has in reality already achieved the proper speed. Similarly the portable fitness monitoring software may provide an additional coach prompt for the athlete to speed up when the athlete has in reality already achieved the proper speed.

In one embodiment in an attempt to remedy these issues the buffer may periodically discard all of its data points in response to an anticipated change in speed by the athlete . For example if the portable fitness monitoring device informs the athlete that their workout routine calls for them to enter a new performance zone interval the GPS smoothing module may cause the buffer to discard all of its data points so that the new weighted average speed is not affected by values that are known to be outdated. In other words the portable fitness monitoring device may be capable of adjusting the buffer based on known or anticipated speed changes based on the device s knowledge of the workout routine.

In one embodiment of the present invention the GPS smoothing module may employ an yet another additional method to increase the accuracy of GPS based speed and pace detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback as outlined in .

At step a plurality of speed points may be calculated from a plurality of time stamped position points. At step an output speed may be calculated based on at least some of the plurality of speed points. At step a determination may be made that the output speed is outside of a predetermined speed range. At step acceleration data may be received from an accelerometer. At step a determination may be made that a recent speed change has occurred based on the acceleration data. Finally at step feedback may be provided to the athlete via the portable fitness monitoring device . In an embodiment the feedback may be provided in response to the determination that the output speed is outside of the predetermined speed range and in response to the determination that the recent speed change has occurred. In one embodiment these steps need not be performed in the order listed.

The plurality of time stamped position points may be for example GPS position points collected by the portable fitness monitoring device at the athlete engages in an activity and traverses a route as described above. In an embodiment the processor of the portable fitness monitoring device may receive the plurality of time stamped position points for further processing.

A plurality of speed points may be calculated from the plurality of time stamped position points. In some embodiments as described above speed point calculation may involve factoring in the distances between consecutive pairs of time stamped position points and factoring in the time periods between consecutive pairs of time stamped position points.

An output speed may be calculated based on at least some of the plurality of speed points. In one embodiment the output speed may be calculated averaging two or more of the plurality of speed points. As described above weighted or other averaging may be employed. In another embodiment also as described above the positioning system smoothing module may maintain at least some of the plurality of speed points in a speed buffer. In such an embodiment the step of calculating the output speed includes calculating an output speed based only on the plurality of speed points in the speed buffer. As explained above the speed buffer may be useful for conducting averaging to determine an output speed.

In an embodiment an accelerometer may be contained within a housing of the portable fitness monitoring device. For example the portable fitness monitoring device may be a mobile phone having both a GPS receiver and an accelerometer contained within the mobile phone housing. In another embodiment the accelerometer may be physically separate from the portable fitness monitoring device and may communicate wirelessly with it as described above.

A determination that a recent speed change has occurred may be based on acceleration data provided by the accelerometer. The accelerometer data may provide acceleration data in response to movements of the portable fitness monitoring device and or the athlete s body during an activity. In an embodiment certain changes in the accelerometer signal may generally suggest that the athlete has changed speeds.

In one embodiment the acceleration data may take the form of a plurality of acceleration points having varying magnitudes. For example the accelerometer may be periodically sampled and may provide consecutive data points registering 1 G 1 G and 2 Gs. In this case the determination that a recent speed change has occurred may include analyzing the differences in the magnitudes of the acceleration points. For example it may be determined that a speed change did not occur between the 1 G and 1 G data points but that a speed change did occur between the 1 G and 2 Gs data points.

In another embodiment the acceleration data may take the form of an acceleration signal having oscillations. For example an accelerometer signal may have a generally sinusoidal output that corresponds to a repetitive motion such as running. In this case the determination that a recent speed change has occurred may include analyzing the changes in the oscillations of the acceleration signal. For example changes in the amplitude or frequency of the sinusoidal output may suggest that a speed change has occurred.

In an embodiment of the present invention where a speed buffer is used the positioning system smoothing module may initiate discarding the plurality of speed points in the speed buffer in response to the determination that a recent speed change has occurred based on the accelerometer data. For example if the portable fitness monitoring device detects a recent speed change via the accelerometer the positioning system smoothing module may cause the speed buffer to discard all of its speed points so that a new output speed calculation is not affected by values that are likely to correspond to a speed the athlete is no longer maintaining. In other words the portable fitness monitoring device may be capable of adjusting the speed buffer based on the accelerometer data. This may increase the accuracy of positioning system based speed detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback.

Feedback may be provided in response to the determination that the output speed is outside of the predetermined speed range and in response to the determination that the recent speed change has occurred via the accelerometer . As described in detail throughout the specification feedback may include for example audio visual and or tactile feedback. Feedback may be generated as part of a planned or custom workout routine that the portable fitness monitoring device is executing. Feedback may inform the athlete that they have fallen below or risen above a desired intensity level for a particular portion of a workout.

In an embodiment the predetermined speed range may be associated with a color coded intensity zone as described above with respect to the color coded zone system depicted in . In such an embodiment the feedback may audibly or visually convey a color to the athlete in accordance with the color coded zone system.

For example an athlete may be engaged in an activity utilizing a portable fitness monitoring device executing a workout routine. The workout routine may presently call for the athlete to maintain a speed corresponding to the green zone i.e. the predetermined speed range corresponds to the green zone . If the portable fitness monitoring device determines that the output speed is below the green zone speed range and further determines that a recent speed change has occurred based on the accelerometer data the portable fitness monitoring device may announce your intensity is only at a blue zone level increase your intensity to enter the green zone. 

In certain situations determining that a recent speed change has occurred based on accelerometer data may increase the accuracy of positioning system based speed detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback as compared to a situation where such information is not considered.

For example in the situation described above where the workout routine presently calls for the athlete to maintain a speed corresponding to the green zone the green zone may range from seven to eight miles per hour. As the athlete is conducting the activity the output speed derived from the positioning system data which may suffer from some degree of inaccuracy may indicate that the athlete s speed has fallen to 6.5 miles per hour. In this case the portable fitness monitoring device would normally provide a feedback prompt to speed up such as your intensity is only at a blue zone level increase your intensity to enter the green zone. However in a situation where the feedback additionally depends on a determination that a recent speed change has occurred based on accelerometer data unless such a determination is made the feedback may be withheld. For example the accelerometer data may indicate a relatively steady pattern of acceleration that indicates that the athlete has not recently changed speeds. Of course if the accelerometer data indicated that a recent speed change had occurred the feedback would still be provided.

Thus the various embodiments described above with respect to the positioning system smoothing module may increase the accuracy of positioning system based speed detection and therefore the accuracy of the real time coaching and or feedback.

In another embodiment of the present invention one or more of the various smoothing methods described may be used and may result in a series of speed and or pace output values. Sometimes the output values may vary once every second or two but only by small amounts. For example pace output values of for example 8 57 9 03 9 01 8 55 9 02 9 04 9 06 and 8 59 may be calculated. If these individual values were displayed to the athlete during an activity the athlete may become distracted by having their attention drawn to constantly varying values that essentially reflect static performance.

In an embodiment to minimize the potential for such distraction a minimum deviation may be calculated and employed. If the difference between consecutive calculated output values is less than the minimum deviation value the value actually displayed to the athlete will not change. For example with regard to the pace based example provided above if a minimum deviation of 8 seconds is used after the first pace output value of 8 57 is displayed the display would continue to output 8 57 even as values of 9 03 9 01 8 55 9 02 and 9 04 are received because each of these values is less that 8 seconds different from 8 57. However when the value of 9 06 is received 9 06 would be displayed because it is greater than 8 seconds different from 8 57. From this point on 9 06 would be displayed until another value greater than 8 seconds different from 9 06 is received. This has the effect of removing micro variations from the pace output without changing the overall macro changes.

Using such a system however it would be possible for the display to remain constant for a long stretch of time if received values continually remain within the minimum deviation. An athlete observing such a display may begin to assume that the display is frozen or that the device is otherwise not working. Accordingly it may be desirable to limit the maximum duration of a content display. In an embodiment a cap may be placed such that the display must be allowed to change after a given period of time such as for example eight seconds. Thus regardless of the degree of deviation or lack thereof from the reference point a new received value may be displayed after eight seconds.

In one embodiment of the present invention acceleration data may be used to predict speed data in the event that a GPS signal is lost in the middle of an athlete s activity. For example as described above prior to the point that a GPS signal is lost the GPS data may have been used to determine the output speed. Rather than reporting the output speed as zero once the GPS signal is lost the device may look to the accelerometer data.

For example during the GPS outage if the accelerometer data shows a relatively steady pattern that indicates that the athlete has not recently changed speeds the device may continue to report a consistent output speed until the GPS signal is restored again. On the other hand during the GPS outage if the accelerometer data shows a steadily increasing or decreasing pattern that indicates that the athlete was in the course of speeding up or slowing down the device may continue to report a steadily increasing or decreasing speed until the GPS signal is restored again.

In some embodiments of the present invention the positioning system receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device may advantageously be used to trigger certain functionalities as is described in further detail below.

With reference to in one embodiment at step a portable fitness monitoring application may be launched on the portable fitness monitoring device . Next at step position data may be received from a satellite positioning system receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device . Then at step the application may determine that the position data indicates that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving. At step an activity may be initiated in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving. Next at step the application may determine that the position data indicates that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving. Finally at step the activity may end in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving.

Such features may be employed by a portable fitness monitoring device for example in the form of a mobile phone. The portable fitness monitoring application may be an application having features such as those described above with reference to . For example the application may execute workout routines a portable fitness monitoring device supported by an athlete while an athlete engages in an activity.

Position data such as a plurality of position points may be received from a satellite positioning system receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device as described above. For example a GPS receiver of the portable fitness monitoring device may provide a plurality of time stamped GPS position points to the processor of the portable fitness monitoring device .

Eventually after the athlete decides to begin their activity e.g. running biking inline skating skiing golfing etc. and begins moving the application may determine that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving. Such a determination may not always be straightforward due to inherent GPS errors and uncertainties such as those described above.

In one embodiment this determination may be based on a determination that the distance between two consecutive position points exceeds a predetermined threshold. For example the application may determine that two consecutive GPS position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device and thus the athlete is moving because the locations associated with the position points are more than five meters apart.

In another embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving may be based on a determination that the distance between two consecutive position points exceeds a predetermined threshold for at least a predetermined period of time. For example the application may determine that two consecutive GPS position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device and thus the athlete is moving because the locations associated with the position points are more than five meters apart for several consecutive sets of position points for five seconds.

In a further embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving may be based on a determination that a series of a minimum number of position points are each at least a minimum distance from a starting point. If the minimum number of position points and the minimum distance are large enough it would be highly likely that the athlete is moving if this test is met. However making these values too large increases the lag time in making the movement determination.

In one embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving may be based on a determination that similar to that just described but modified to reflect a known position point uncertainty. Specifically if the uncertainty of a particular position point is known or can be calculated and expressed as a function of distance the minimum distance described above can be modified as a function of the uncertainty. In other words position points associated with high uncertainties will be less likely to be relied upon.

In another embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving may be based on a determination that a minimum number of position points are ever increasing in distance from the starting point i.e. a concentric circle method . This method advantageously does not require the athlete to have covered a minimum distance but alone in a noisy signal environment the test may be difficult to satisfy. In an embodiment an accelerometer signal may be used to reduce the minimum number of position point required. Specifically if the accelerometer signal indicates a change in speed as described above the concentric circle test may only need to employ a reduce number of position points to make a determination.

In a further embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving may be based on a combination of the concentric circle method and one of the minimum distance methods described above. Specifically the portable fitness monitoring device may first employ the concentric circle method while still collecting and analyzing data according to the minimum distance method in parallel. If the concentric circle method is satisfied the athlete is considered to be moving. If the concentric circle test fails the device falls back on the minimum distance method to determine whether the athlete is moving.

In one embodiment the concentric circle test may be modified by analyzing bearings i.e. directional headings . Specifically as each new position point is received a bearing from the starting point to the new point may be calculated. The test is not satisfied if the bearing for a new point differs from any previous bearing by a set number of degrees such as for example 90 degrees.

In another embodiment position points may be collected in a set and analyzed by known statistical methods to determine the randomness of the position points. For example the randomness of the latitudes of the points the longitudes of the points or both may be analyzed.

An activity may be initiated by the application in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving.

In one embodiment the activity may be the execution of a workout routine such that the portable fitness monitoring device may begin to execute a workout routine in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving. Workout routines are described in detail throughout the specification. For example in one embodiment the workout routine may include a plurality of intervals where each interval has an intensity goal. The intensity goal may be for example a target heart rate range a target speed range or a target pace range. As described above the target performance parameter intensity goal ranges may be associated with a color coded zone system. Thus embodiments of the present invention may advantageously be used to trigger the initiation of workouts without requiring the athlete to take an affirmative action beyond initiating motion such as for example actuating a button on the portable fitness monitoring device .

In another embodiment the activity may be the playback of music such that the portable fitness monitoring device may begin to playback music in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving. In one embodiment the playback of music may not begin until an additional determination is made that workout routine execution has begun. Music playback is described in detail above.

For example in one embodiment the music played back to the athlete during the activity may be associated with a playlist. Once music playback is initiated the application may consult a playlist which may indicate a group of music tracks to be played and the order they should be played in. The music tracks and or a playlist file corresponding to the playlist may be save in the memory of the portable fitness monitoring device. Alternatively the music tracks and or a playlist file corresponding to the playlist may be remotely accessible for example via a wireless network. In an embodiment the music tracks and or a playlist file may be downloaded to the portable fitness monitoring device along with a workout routine. Thus embodiments of the present invention may advantageously be used to trigger the playing of a playlist without requiring the athlete to take an affirmative action beyond initiating motion such as for example actuating a button on the portable fitness monitoring device .

Eventually after the athlete decides to end their activity e.g. running biking inline skating golfing etc. and ceases moving the application may determine that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving. The determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving may be made in a variety of ways similar to those described above with respect to determining that the portable fitness monitoring device is moving.

In one embodiment this determination may be based on a determination that the distance between two consecutive position points is less than a predetermined threshold. For example the application may determine that two consecutive GPS position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device and thus the athlete is not moving because the locations associated with the position points are less than five meters apart.

In another embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving may be based on a determination that the distance between two consecutive position points is less than a predetermined threshold for at least a predetermined period of time. For example the application may determine that two consecutive GPS position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device and thus the athlete is not moving because the locations associated with the position points are less than five meters apart for several consecutive sets of position points for five seconds.

In a further embodiment the determination that the position points indicate that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving may be based on first determining speed points. If the speed points suggest that the speed has dropped below a predetermined level for example one mile per hour the athlete may be considered to be stopped.

In an embodiment an accelerometer signal may be used to that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving. Specifically if the accelerometer signal indicates a change in speed as described above i.e. that the speed has dropped to zero it may be assumed that the athlete is no longer moving.

Regardless of whether the activity is the execution of a workout routine or the playback of music the activity may be ended by the application in response to the determination that the portable fitness monitoring device is not moving. Thus embodiments of the present invention may advantageously be used to end the execution of a workout routine and or end the playback of music without requiring the athlete to take an affirmative action beyond ceasing motion such as actuating a button on the portable fitness monitoring device . In an embodiment the system may pause music in response to a stop in motion and then restart it when the user is moving again. When the user us finally stopped the system may stop the music and the workout routine.

As described above with respect to the GUIs provided to a user at a personal computer via the server in an embodiment of the present invention the history sub module of the track module may provide a playlist section in a sidebar . If the athlete conducted a workout while listening to music on a music enabled portable fitness monitoring device the playlist section may provide a listing of the musical audio tracks that the athlete listened to during their workout. In an embodiment the musical audio tracks that the athlete listened to during their workout may be correlated to performance information collected during the workout.

As described above a portable fitness monitoring device may be supported by an athlete during a workout. The portable fitness monitoring device may be associated with one or more sensors that are capable of detecting information used to measure and or calculate performance parameters such as location distance covered speed pace and or heart rate. The portable fitness monitoring device may include an audio unit . In one embodiment the audio unit may be responsible for managing the storage and playback of music tracks which may involve the use of a playlist. Other music track and or playlist features may also be included such as those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 857 862 titled Location aware fitness training device methods and program products that support real time interactive communication and automated route generation which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

When the portable fitness monitoring device detects measures and or calculates parameter information including the locations of time stamped position points encountered by the athlete while traversing a route e.g. via a positioning system receiver instantaneous performance parameters may be correlated with the position points encountered at roughly the same time the performance parameters were collected. This correlated performance parameter information may be transmitted to the server for example via the WWAN or WPAN transceiver in substantially real time during the workout or after the workout has been completed as described in detail above.

In another embodiment a music track that was played for the athlete may be correlated with the position points encountered and or performance parameter information collected at roughly the same time that the music track was played for the athlete by the portable fitness monitoring device . In this way the system of the present invention may advantageously be able to provide the athlete with information regarding the relationship between the music they listened to and their performance during the workout.

In one embodiment of the present invention the history sub module of the track module may initiate the display of a GUI window that includes performance parameter information regarding an athlete s performance during a workout as a function of time. The GUI window may also include the title of a music track that was played for the athlete by a portable fitness monitoring device during the workout. In an embodiment the display of the title of a music track may occur in response to a user specifying a particular point in time during the workout.

For example as described above and as illustrated in performance information for one or more performance parameters may be displayed in the primary display of a GUI window on a line graph whose x axis is either time or distance based and whose y axis is correlated to the value of the measured performance parameter. For example in a line graph charts heart rate and pace information respectively as a function of time during the workout.

As illustrated in a user interested in viewing instantaneous performance statistics throughout the athlete s workout may be able to select and drag a scrollbar with their cursor along the x axis. As the user drags the scrollbar across the x axis an icon may travel along the line graph plotted for the performance parameter of interest. In addition a pop up window displaying additional instantaneous performance data may appear and move across the screen along with the moving icon. In addition to the information displayed in in an embodiment as the user drags the scrollbar across the x axis the title of a music track that was played for the athlete by the portable fitness monitoring device at a particular point in time may be displayed. This may be possible because as described above a music track that was played for the athlete may be correlated with the position points encountered and or performance parameter information collected at roughly the same time that the music track was played for the athlete by the portable fitness monitoring device .

In another embodiment the user may be able to specify the particular point in time during the workout for which they would like the corresponding music track title to be displayed by other mechanisms besides the scrollbar. For example in an embodiment the user may be able to specify the particular point in time during the workout for which they would like the corresponding music track title to be displayed by hovering their cursor directly over a portion of the line graph that corresponds to the particular point in time.

In one embodiment the athlete could conduct their workout using a GPS enabled portable fitness monitoring device capable of recording their geographic position points along the geographical route traversed. Either during traversal of the route or after the route has been completed the GPS data could then be uploaded to the server and associated with other performance monitoring information collected and or music played during traversal of the route. Then as illustrated in and described above an illustration of the athlete s geographical route may be displayed to a user at a computer .

As illustrated in a user interested in viewing instantaneous performance statistics throughout the workout may be able to select and drag a scrollbar with their cursor along the bottom of the screen. As the user drags the scrollbar across the bottom of the screen an icon may travel along the geographical route path plotted. In addition a pop up window displaying additional instantaneous performance data may appear and move across the screen along with the moving icon. In addition to the information displayed in in an embodiment as the user drags the scrollbar across the bottom of the screen the title of a music track that was played for the athlete by the portable fitness monitoring device at a particular point along the route may be displayed. This may be possible because as described above a music track that was played for the athlete may be correlated with the position points encountered and or performance parameter information collected at roughly the same time that the music track was played for the athlete by the portable fitness monitoring device .

In another embodiment the user may be able to specify the particular point along the route during the workout for which they would like the corresponding music track title to be displayed with respect to the geographical route path by other mechanisms besides the scrollbar. For example in an embodiment the user may be able to specify the particular point along the route during the workout for which they would like the corresponding music track title to be displayed by hovering their cursor directly over a portion of the illustration of the geographical route path that corresponds to the particular point along the route. In another embodiment the system may play a designated highly motivational song based ont rack characteristics e.g. when the user encounters an uphill section .

In an embodiment the illustration of the geographical route may also be overlaid on a map as described above with respect to . In other embodiments in response to the user specifying a particular point in time during the workout the name of a band or artist associated with the music track may also be displayed along with the title of the music track.

In one embodiment as illustrated in when a user hovers their cursor over a particular song on a playlist a pop up balloon may appear near a highlighted portion of the route that corresponds to the segment of the route that the athlete was traversing while listening to the particular song in the illustrated case Song . As further illustrated the pop up balloon indicates that Song was played from the 4 01 to 6 18 time periods of the activity which correspond to the 0.20 0.63 mile segments of the activity i.e. route portion .

While the above described embodiments relating to the display of music track title information relied on display correlated to heart rate or position information the displays may alternatively be correlated to any other performance parameter such as for example speed or pace. Furthermore while the display was discussed as being with respect to time the display may also be with respect to distance.

In addition to providing feedback regarding a particular music track that was played at a particular time and or location during a workout the playlist section may provide a listing of the musical audio tracks that the athlete listened to during their workout.

In one embodiment based on the correlation between music tracks played and performance information collected during a workout the server software may be able to analyze the music tracks played to determine how the athlete s performance related to particular songs. For example the software could determine which songs corresponded to the athlete s highest heart rate pace and or speed. In an embodiment a listing of music tracks available to the athlete could be provided in order based on which tracks were associated with the highest heart rates paces or speeds and or the music tracks could be grouped into various categories.

In another embodiment based on this information the server software may be able to assist in the creation of suitable playlists for particular workouts. For example as described above in some embodiments a playlist and or the music tracks listed by the playlist may be transmitted to the portable fitness monitoring device along with a workout routine. If a workout routine includes a series of heart rate speed or pace based intervals with varying intensities it may be advantageous to provide the athlete with an accompanying playlist that provides music tracks that have in the past been shown to correlate well with given intensities for the athlete . For example if the software has previously determined that three particular music tracks are associated with paces of around seven minutes per mile for a particular athlete and that athlete is scheduled to engage in a workout that calls for a yellow zone interval where the yellow zone corresponds to paces of six to eight minutes per mile then it may be advantageous to provide the athlete with a playlist that indicates that these three music tracks should be played during the athlete s yellow zone interval.
