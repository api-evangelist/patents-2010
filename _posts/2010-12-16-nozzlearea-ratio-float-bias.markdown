The present application is a divisional application from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 894 313 filed Aug. 21 2007.

This invention was made with Government support under N00019 02 C 3003 awarded by Department of the Navy. The Federal Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to convergent divergent nozzles used in gas turbine engines. In particular the present invention relates to convergent divergent nozzles with a floating area ratio.

Prior gas turbine engines have in some configurations included exit nozzles attached to the aft end of the engine. Exit nozzles are commonly employed to produce additional thrust for the engine by accelerating the working medium gas for example air leaving the aft end of the main engine for example via the low pressure turbine through the nozzle. Exit nozzles accelerate the air leaving the engine and therefore produce useful thrust by prescribing the nozzle area for particular exit pressures inside the nozzle. One such exit nozzle is the variable convergent divergent nozzle. Prior variable convergent divergent nozzles commonly include convergent divergent flap sets arranged circumferentially about the main axis of the engine to form a substantially circular annular nozzle extending aft of for example the low pressure turbine. The convergent divergent flap sets are commonly connected to an annular ring sometimes referred to as a sync ring which is in turn connected to an engine casing. The convergent flap in each of the convergent divergent flap sets declines generally toward the main axis of the engine as the flap extends aftwardly. The divergent flap in each of the convergent divergent flap sets may be pivotally connected to the convergent flap and inclines generally away from the main axis of the engine as the flap extends aftwardly. The circumferentially arranged convergent divergent flap sets therefore form an annular nozzle whose cross sectional area decreases from the forward end of the nozzle to a throat generally defined by the pivotal connection between the convergent and divergent flaps and then increases from the throat to the nozzle exit.

In order to operate efficiently variable convergent divergent nozzles are configured to position the convergent and divergent flaps and thereby the annular shape of the entire nozzle to optimize engine performance. The position of the convergent and divergent flaps and thereby the annular shape of the nozzle is commonly represented by the ratio of the cross sectional area of the nozzle at the exit A divided by the cross sectional area of the nozzle at the throat A or A A. The nozzle pressure ratio NPR is equal to the total pressure at the nozzle throat P divided by the ambient pressure P or NPR P P. Convergent divergent nozzles function generally by designing A Afor critical flight conditions NPR in order to produce useful thrust by extracting as much energy as is practicable from the working medium gas flowing through the nozzle.

Prior variable convergent divergent nozzles have used various means to vary the position of the convergent and divergent flaps for different engine conditions. For example some prior convergent divergent nozzles have mechanically prescribed the position of the convergent and divergent flaps through a kinematic mechanism driven by one or more actuators to tune A Afor specific engine conditions. Prior convergent divergent nozzles have also employed kinematics that vary A Awith respect to Ato achieve improved performance at multiple engine operating conditions. This arrangement allows for a single valued A Afor all Awithout the weight and complexity of independently controlling A A. Other prior convergent divergent nozzles have employed a toggling configuration triggered by the pressure inside the nozzle which acts to position the divergent flaps for low and high Arespectively low and high mode . Nozzles employing such a toggling configuration are considered to have two available values of Afor each A. At low A which is typical of aircraft cruise and low values of NPR a low value of A Ais desirable. At relatively high values of Aa higher value of A Ais desirable which corresponds to conditions associated with aircraft acceleration. Thus the low mode low A A condition corresponds to relatively low values of NPR and high mode higher A A corresponds to relatively high values of NPR.

Prior variable convergent divergent nozzles have several disadvantages with respect to A A. In prior nozzles independently controlling Aand A one disadvantage is weight and complexity design and control . For scheduled single valued A Anozzles one disadvantage is an inability to run optimally at low and high NPR cruise and acceleration . More generally prior nozzle designs have varied the nozzle geometry to optimally position the convergent and divergent flaps at low mode and high mode but have failed to vary the convergent and divergent flaps position through an intermediate mode of engine operation between low and high modes. Therefore prior nozzle configurations have failed to advantageously position the convergent and divergent flaps for a substantial number of NPR values encountered during engine operation thereby causing sub optimal engine performance at many of the NPR values encountered.

Embodiments of the present invention include a mechanism included in a convergent divergent nozzle connected to an aft portion of a gas turbine engine which mechanism includes a convergent flap configured to be kinematically connected to the aft portion of the gas turbine engine a divergent flap pivotally connected to the convergent flap and configured to be kinematically connected to the aft portion of the gas turbine engine at least one actuator configured to be connected to the aft portion of the gas turbine engine and to mechanically prescribe the position of the convergent flap and the divergent flap by moving through one or more positions and at least one biasing apparatus. The biasing apparatus is configured to position at least one of the convergent flap and the divergent flap independent of the positions of the actuator by substantially balancing a force on the at least one of the convergent flap and the divergent flap produced by a gas pressure on the nozzle.

Nozzle augments the thrust produced by the gas and fuel mixture expanded through turbine by accelerating the gas and fuel mixture through the exit of engine . Nozzle accelerates the gas and fuel mixture leaving the engine and thereby produces additional thrust by prescribing the nozzle area for particular exit pressures inside the nozzle. Specifically nozzle in includes convergent and divergent flaps circumferentially arranged to form a generally circular annular nozzle . The aft end of convergent flaps are pivotally connected to the forward end of divergent flaps . The cross sectional area of nozzle decreases from the forward end of convergent flaps to nozzle throat defined by a plane perpendicular to engine axis and passing through the pivotal connection between convergent and divergent flaps . From nozzle throat the cross sectional area of nozzle increases toward engine exit . Nozzle accelerates the gas and fuel mixture leaving turbine by prescribing the ratio of the area of nozzle at engine exit A divided by the area of nozzle at nozzle throat A for different pressures inside nozzle . As discussed above nozzle pressures are generally represented by NPR which in is equal to the pressure at nozzle throat P divided by the ambient pressure P or NPR P P. Therefore nozzle prescribes A Aby positioning convergent and divergent flaps as a function of varying values of NPR encountered during operation of engine .

Mechanism is configured to mechanically and aerodynamically prescribe the position of convergent and divergent flaps as a function of NPR. Specifically mechanism is a kinematic mechanism including the interconnection of convergent flap divergent flap and first second third and fourth links and mechanically driven by actuator . Actuator is configured to move forward and aftward through one or more positions which actuator movement mechanically drives mechanism and thereby positions convergent and divergent flaps . The movement of actuator may be controlled to position convergent and divergent flaps for varying values of NPR encountered during operation of engine .

Independent of the movement of actuator mechanism is configured to vary the position of convergent and divergent flaps as a function of the gas pressure acting on nozzle during operation of engine . Although mechanism is configured to aerodynamically vary convergent and divergent flaps as a function of NPR embodiments of the present invention also include configurations capable of aerodynamically prescribing the position of the convergent flap but not the divergent flap and configurations capable of aerodynamically prescribing the position of the divergent flap but not the convergent flap . In fourth link is pivotally and slidably connected to divergent flap . The sliding connection between fourth link and divergent flap is configured to impart a degree of freedom of movement to divergent flap independent of the mechanical positioning of mechanism by actuator . For example in the sliding connection between fourth link and divergent flap is at a radially outward limit. However as the pressure acting on nozzle changes divergent flap may react to a force created by the pressure acting on nozzle by rotating counter clockwise about divergent flap rotation center and moving along the sliding connection with link . In this example the movement of divergent flap is configured with a mechanical limit prescribed by the radially inward limit of the sliding connection with link .

In order to prescribe one or more positions of convergent and divergent flaps as a function of NPR as opposed to only imparting an additional degree of freedom of movement mechanism includes biasing apparatus configured to substantially balance the pressure acting to rotate convergent and divergent flaps . In the embodiment of biasing apparatus is an offset hinge created by offsetting divergent flap rotation center from the pivotal connections between divergent flap and convergent flap and third link . Biasing apparatus is configured to employ the pressure inside nozzle acting on convergent flap to counteract and substantially balance the pressure inside nozzle acting on divergent flap .

In operation at a given NPR value mechanism may mechanically prescribe the position of convergent and divergent flaps by the movement of actuator and the kinematic interconnections of convergent and divergent flaps and first second third and fourth links . Once the position of convergent and divergent flaps is mechanically prescribed convergent and divergent flaps may float through a range of positions based on changing NPR values as the pressure inside nozzle changes and biasing apparatus automatically adjusts to substantially balance the pressure at a new convergent and divergent flap position. Mechanism is configured to mechanically limit the range of floating positions of convergent and divergent flap achieved by the interaction between the pressure inside nozzle and the balancing action of biasing apparatus . During engine operation for example at and below an NPR low mode value the position of convergent and divergent flaps is configured to remain substantially fixed and is mechanically prescribed by the position of actuator . Between the NPR low mode value and an NPR high mode value convergent and divergent flaps are configured to float through a range of positions as the pressure inside nozzle is substantially balanced by biasing apparatus . At and above the NPR high mode value the position of convergent and divergent flaps is configured to remain substantially fixed and is mechanically prescribed by the position of actuator . In the embodiment of the mechanical limit on the float range of convergent and divergent flaps is provided by fourth link and the pivotal and sliding connection between fourth link and divergent flap .

Therefore in mechanism may be configured to mechanically proscribe the position of convergent flaps at and below NPR low mode and at and above NPR high mode. Link may be adjusted for different operating conditions of engine to provide a mechanical limit on the float range of convergent and divergent flaps and thereby mechanically prescribe a particular convergent and divergent flap position at particular NPR low and high mode values. Mechanism independent of mechanically proscribing the position of convergent and divergent flaps also may be configured to float the position of convergent and divergent flaps through a range of positions as the pressure inside nozzle at values of NPR between high and low modes is substantially balanced by biasing apparatus . The offset hinge comprising biasing apparatus may be adjusted to adapt mechanism to different operating conditions of engine i.e. to substantially balance different pressures inside nozzle .

In A Ais plotted as a function of NPR for a nozzle including a plurality of mechanisms configured similarly to mechanism . generally shows NPR values ranging from low mode to float mode to high mode and includes first performance curve and second performance curve . First performance curve represents ideal A A and thereby ideal nozzle geometry variation for NPR values ranging from low mode to high mode . Second performance curve shows A Afor one embodiment of a nozzle according to the present invention for NPR values ranging from low mode to high mode . Nozzles according to the present invention are adapted to float through a range of A Avalues between low mode and high mode as illustrated by the non linear portion of curve in . Nozzles according to the present invention may be configured for different engine operating conditions to achieve nozzle performance in float mode approximating ideal performance illustrated in as second performance curve . Performance adjustments in float mode may be achieved by adapting biasing apparatuses included in the nozzle to engine operating conditions. For example nozzle performance may be adjusted by adapting the biasing force to substantially balance pressure conditions and thereby define A Aby positioning the convergent and divergent flaps of the nozzle through a range of NPR values between low mode and high mode .

Convergent divergent nozzles and gas turbine engines including convergent divergent nozzles according to the present invention have several advantages over prior nozzle configurations. Nozzles according to the present invention include a plurality of mechanisms circumferentially arranged about a main axis of the gas turbine engine and configured to mechanically and aerodynamically position convergent and divergent flaps as a function of a gas pressure on the nozzle. Each of the plurality of mechanisms include at least one biasing apparatus configured to position at least one of the convergent and divergent flaps independent of a mechanically prescribed position by substantially balancing a force produced by a gas pressure acting on the nozzle. During engine operation nozzles according to the present invention are configured to provide a float mode between NPR low and high modes in which the position of one or both the convergent and divergent flaps float through a range of positions as a function of the changing pressure on the nozzle. Also nozzles according to the present invention are configured to provide a wider range of convergent and divergent flap positions and thereby nozzle geometry A A between NPR low and high modes than prior nozzles. Finally nozzles according to the present invention may be adjusted for varying NPR low to high modal shifts thereby adjusting nozzle performance for different engine configurations and operating conditions. Nozzles according to the present invention therefore substantially increase engine efficiency and performance over prior nozzle configurations by advantageously positioning the convergent and divergent flaps for a substantially greater number of NPR values encountered during engine operation.

Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
