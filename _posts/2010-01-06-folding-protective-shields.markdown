The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to protective shields and in particular to shields for protection from ballistic threats.

Some mounted machine guns and artillery pieces may be equipped with metal armor plates to protect the gunners from sniper fire and shrapnel from explosions. Some gun shields may be improvised in the field using salvaged metal plates. In the Vietnam War the crews of some armored fighting vehicles and PT Boats would affix metal plates to their machine guns. After the Vietnam War gun shields fell out of widespread use.

Modern battlegrounds are filled with weapon fire. The weapon fire presents a grave risk to soldiers who expose themselves to fire upon the enemy. The weapon fire may include incoming fire from elevated precision fire weapons and ground born threats such as mines and improvised explosive devices. In particular many casualties are hit in areas not protected by body armor or helmets such as the neck or face. A disadvantage of gun shields is that they may limit the visibility of the user to the front. In the case of vehicle mounted guns gun shields may also adversely affect the performance of tasks other than firing a gun.

Military tanks such as the Abrams tank may include a turret with one or more hatches. On the Abrams tank one of the turret hatches is located at the loader s weapon station. Mounted adjacent the loader s hatch may be a weapon such as a 7.62 mm rifle. The weapon may be mounted with a skate mount. When using the loader s weapon the weapon user may be vulnerable to enemy fire. A need exists for a protective shield for the operator of the weapon at the loader s station.

It is another object of the invention to provide a folding protective shield configured for the loader s weapon station of a tank.

One aspect of the invention may be a protective folding shield apparatus for mounting to a rail of a vehicle. The apparatus may include a generally rectangular shield a base stand fixed to a first side of the shield a shim fixed to the first side of the shield and spaced apart from the base stand a hinge fixed to the base stand and the shim a base fixed to the base stand a pair of latch bases fixed to the base adjacent a second side of the shield a pair of latch uprights fixed to the second side of the shield and a plurality of clamps fixed to the base. The rail may be disposed between the clamps and the base. In a substantially vertical position of the generally rectangular shield the pair of latch uprights may be removably fixed to respective ones of the latch bases.

The base stand may include a tab inserted in a tab opening in the base. The apparatus may further include a spacer lip disposed beneath the base and on the same side of the base as the first side of the shield. Each latch base may include a boss inserted in a boss opening in the base. The latch uprights may be removably fixed to the latch bases using pins. In a substantially horizontal position the latch uprights may not be fixed to the latch bases.

The clamps may include threaded openings and the clamps may be fixed to the base with threaded fasteners. The base may be arcuate.

Another aspect of the invention may be an armor kit for a tank. The armor kit may include a generally rectangular shield a base stand fixed to a first side of the shield a shim fixed to the first side of the shield and spaced apart from the base stand a hinge fixed to the base stand and the shim a base fixed to the base stand a pair of latch bases fixed to the base adjacent a second side of the shield and a pair of latch uprights fixed to the second side of the shield. In a substantially vertical position of the generally rectangular shield the pair of latch uprights may be removably fixed to respective ones of the latch bases.

The armor kit may further include a plurality of clamps for fixing the base to a rail and a hatch latch. The hatch latch may include a base an arm support fixed to the base and an arm pivotally fixed in the arm support. The arm of the hatch latch may include an upper pin and a lower pin.

A further aspect of the invention may be an armor kit for a tank wherein a hatch spacer is used in place of the hatch latch. The hatch spacer may include a generally planar base an upright portion and a generally planar support surface.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A folding protective shield in accordance with the invention may be used wherever protection is needed.

The loader s hatch on the MA Abrams tank may also provide ballistic protection if latched in a suitable orientation. is a perspective view of an adjustable loader s hatch latch that may be suitable for the loader s hatch on the MA Abrams tank. and C are elevation and top views respectively of the hatch latch of .

Latch may include a base an arm support fixed to the base and an arm that is pivotally held in arm support . Arm includes upper pin and lower pin . A quick release pin prevents rotation of arm . In the position shown in B and C the arm is locked in position by quick release pin . This locked position enables the loader s hatch to be rotated about ninety degrees from a closed position i.e. the hatch will be substantially vertical and latch against the upper pin of the arm . The upright position of the loader s hatch provides additional cover concealment and protection for the operator at the loader s station.

If it is desired to secure the loader s hatch in a completely open position substantially horizontal then the quick release pin is removed and the arm is rotated clockwise as shown by the arrow in until the arm contacts stop member . The quick release pin is then re inserted and the loader s hatch is opened until it latches against lower pin .

The structure of the loader s hatch on the MA differs from the MA so the latch may not be useful on the MA. On the MA tank the fully open position of the loader s hatch may be only about 22 degrees from the horizontal. If the angle between the hatch and the horizontal were increased the hatch would present a larger obstacle to incoming fire. A hatch spacer may position the loader s hatch at a higher angle thus providing more protection.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
