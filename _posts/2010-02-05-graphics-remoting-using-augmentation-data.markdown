Remote computing systems can enable users to remotely access hosted resources. Servers on the remote computing systems can execute programs and transmit signals indicative of a user interface to clients that can connect by sending signals over a network conforming to a communication protocol such as the TCP IP protocol. Each connecting client may be provided a remote presentation session i.e. an execution environment that includes a set of resources. Each client can transmit signals indicative of user input to the server and the server can apply the user input to the appropriate session. The clients may use remote presentation protocols such as the Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to connect to a server resource.

In remote desktop scenarios the graphics content of a user s desktop located on a host computer e.g. the server is typically streamed to another computer e.g. the client . Typically client screens are captured as frames which are then passed to a remote presentation process for encoding and transmitting the bitmap data to produce a remote presentation network stream comprising bitmap data.

In some remote presentation systems a stream of graphics rendering commands and image data may be transmitted to render images. It would be advantageous to combine the features of techniques involving the transmission of primitives and the transmission of full bitmaps to provide a method and system that incorporates the benefits of both techniques.

In various embodiments methods and systems are disclosed in which bitmap data transmission may be improved by using some of the advantages of primitive remoting thus allowing for the reduction of the bandwidth and processing needed to remote a virtual desktop experience. In an embodiment rendering is performed and bitmaps are remoted but metadata comprising shortcuts or hints are provided to assist in the rendering of the bitmap data.

In addition to the foregoing other aspects are described in the claims drawings and text forming a part of the present disclosure. It can be appreciated by one of skill in the art that one or more various aspects of the disclosure may include but are not limited to circuitry and or programming for effecting the herein referenced aspects of the present disclosure the circuitry and or programming can be virtually any combination of hardware software and or firmware configured to effect the herein referenced aspects depending upon the design choices of the system designer.

In example embodiments where circuitry includes a combination of hardware and software an implementer may write source code embodying logic that is subsequently compiled into machine readable code that can be executed by a logical processor. Since one skilled in the art can appreciate that the state of the art has evolved to a point where there is little difference between hardware software or a combination of hardware software the selection of hardware versus software to effectuate functions is merely a design choice.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client computer system. The client computer system presents the output data. Thus input is received and output presented at the client computer system while processing actually occurs at the terminal server. A session can include a shell and a user interface such as a desktop the subsystems that track mouse movement within the desktop the subsystems that translate a mouse click on an icon into commands that effectuate an instance of a program etc. In another example embodiment the session can include an application. In this example while an application is rendered a desktop environment may still be generated and hidden from the user. It should be understood that the foregoing discussion is exemplary and that the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in various client server environments and not limited to a particular terminal services product.

In most if not all remote desktop environments input data entered at a client computer system typically includes mouse and keyboard data representing commands to an application and output data generated by an application at the terminal server typically includes video data for display on a video output device. Many remote desktop environments also include functionality that extend to transfer other types of data.

Communications channels can be used to extend the RDP protocol by allowing plug ins to transfer data over an RDP connection. Many such extensions exist. Features such as printer redirection clipboard redirection port redirection etc. use communications channel technology. Thus in addition to input and output data there may be many communications channels that need to transfer data. Accordingly there may be occasional requests to transfer output data and one or more channel requests to transfer other data contending for available network bandwidth.

Referring now to depicted are high level block diagrams of computer systems configured to effectuate virtual machines. As shown in the figures computer system can include elements described in and components operable to effectuate virtual machines. One such component is a hypervisor that may also be referred to in the art as a virtual machine monitor. The hypervisor in the depicted embodiment can be configured to control and arbitrate access to the hardware of computer system . Broadly stated the hypervisor can generate execution environments called partitions such as child partition through child partition N where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1 . In embodiments a child partition can be considered the basic unit of isolation supported by the hypervisor that is each child partition can be mapped to a set of hardware resources e.g. memory devices logical processor cycles etc. that is under control of the hypervisor and or the parent partition and hypervisor can isolate one partition from accessing another partition s resources. In embodiments the hypervisor can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard specialized integrated circuits or a combination thereof.

In the above example computer system includes a parent partition that can also be thought of as domain 0 in the open source community. Parent partition can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in child partitions 1 N by using virtualization service providers VSPs that are also known as back end drivers in the open source community. In this example architecture the parent partition can gate access to the underlying hardware. The VSPs can be used to multiplex the interfaces to the hardware resources by way of virtualization service clients VSCs that are also known as front end drivers in the open source community. Each child partition can include one or more virtual processors such as virtual processors through that guest operating systems through can manage and schedule threads to execute thereon. Generally the virtual processors through are executable instructions and associated state information that provide a representation of a physical processor with a specific architecture. For example one virtual machine may have a virtual processor having characteristics of an Intel x86 processor whereas another virtual processor may have the characteristics of a PowerPC processor. The virtual processors in this example can be mapped to logical processors of the computer system such that the instructions that effectuate the virtual processors will be backed by logical processors. Thus in these example embodiments multiple virtual processors can be simultaneously executing while for example another logical processor is executing hypervisor instructions. Generally speaking and as illustrated by the figures the combination of virtual processors various VSCs and memory in a partition can be considered a virtual machine such as virtual machine or .

Generally guest operating systems through can include any operating system such as for example operating systems from Microsoft Apple the open source community etc. The guest operating systems can include user kernel modes of operation and can have kernels that can include schedulers memory managers etc. A kernel mode can include an execution mode in a logical processor that grants access to at least privileged processor instructions. Each guest operating system through can have associated file systems that can have applications stored thereon such as terminal servers e commerce servers email servers etc. and the guest operating systems themselves. The guest operating systems can schedule threads to execute on the virtual processors and instances of such applications can be effectuated.

Referring now to illustrated is an alternative architecture that can be used to effectuate virtual machines. depicts similar components to those of however in this example embodiment the hypervisor can include the virtualization service providers and device drivers and parent partition may contain configuration utilities . In this architecture hypervisor can perform the same or similar functions as the hypervisor of . The hypervisor of can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard or a portion of hypervisor can be effectuated by specialized integrated circuits. In this example parent partition may have instructions that can be used to configure hypervisor however hardware access requests may be handled by hypervisor instead of being passed to parent partition .

Referring now to computer may include circuitry configured to provide remote desktop services to connecting clients. In an example embodiment the depicted operating system may execute directly on the hardware or a guest operating system or may be effectuated by a virtual machine such as VM or VM . The underlying hardware and is indicated in the illustrated type of dashed lines to identify that the hardware can be virtualized.

Remote services can be provided to at least one client such as client while one client is depicted remote services can be provided to more clients. The example client can include a computer terminal that is effectuated by hardware configured to direct user input to a remote server session and display user interface information generated by the session. In another embodiment client can be effectuated by a computer that includes similar elements as those of computer . In this embodiment client can include circuitry configured to effect operating systems and circuitry configured to emulate the functionality of terminals e.g. a remote desktop client application that can be executed by one or more logical processors . One skilled in the art can appreciate that the circuitry configured to effectuate the operating system can also include circuitry configured to emulate a terminal.

Each connecting client can have a session such as session which allows the client to access data and applications stored on computer . Generally applications and certain operating system components can be loaded into a region of memory assigned to a session. Thus in certain instances some OS components can be spawned N times where N represents the number of current sessions . These various OS components can request services from the operating system kernel which can for example manage memory facilitate disk reads writes and configure threads from each session to execute on the logical processor . Some example subsystems that can be loaded into session space can include the subsystems that generates desktop environments the subsystems that track mouse movement within the desktop the subsystems that translate mouse clicks on icons into commands that effectuate an instance of a program etc. The processes that effectuate these services e.g. tracking mouse movement are tagged with an identifier associated with the session and are loaded into a region of memory that is allocated to the session.

A session can be generated by a session manager e.g. a process. For example the session manager can initialize and manage each remote session by generating a session identifier for a session space assigning memory to the session space and generating system environment variables and instances of subsystem processes in memory assigned to the session space. The session manager can be invoked when a request for a remote desktop session is received by the operating system .

A connection request can first be handled by a transport stack e.g. a remote desktop protocol RDP stack. The transport stack instructions can configure logical processor to listen for connection messages on a certain port and forward them to the session manager . When sessions are generated the transport stack can instantiate a remote desktop protocol stack instance for each session. Stack instance is an example stack instance that can be generated for session . Generally each remote desktop protocol stack instance can be configured to route output to an associated client and route client input to an environment subsystem for the appropriate remote session.

As shown by the figure in an embodiment an application while one is shown others can also execute can execute and generate an array of bits. The array can be processed by a graphics interface which in turn can render bitmaps e.g. arrays of pixel values that can be stored in memory. As shown by the figure a remote display subsystem can be instantiated which can capture rendering calls and send the calls over the network to client via the stack instance for the session.

In addition to remoting graphics and audio a plug and play redirector can also be instantiated in order to remote diverse devices such as printers mp3 players client file systems CD ROM drives etc. The plug and play redirector can receive information from a client side component which identifies the peripheral devices coupled to the client . The plug and play redirector can then configure the operating system to load redirecting device drivers for the peripheral devices of the client . The redirecting device drivers can receive calls from the operating system to access the peripherals and send the calls over the network to the client .

As discussed above clients may use a protocol for providing remote presentation services such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to connect to a resource using terminal services. When a remote desktop client connects to a terminal server via a terminal server gateway the gateway may open a socket connection with the terminal server and redirect client traffic on the remote presentation port or a port dedicated to remote access services. The gateway may also perform certain gateway specific exchanges with the client using a terminal server gateway protocol transmitted over HTTPS.

Turning to depicted is a computer system including circuitry for effectuating remote services and for incorporating aspects of the present disclosure. As shown by the figure in an embodiment a computer system can include components similar to those described in and and can effectuate a remote presentation session. In an embodiment of the present disclosure a remote presentation session can include aspects of a console session e.g. a session spawned for a user using the computer system and a remote session. Similar to that described above the session manager can initialize and manage the remote presentation session by enabling disabling components in order to effectuate a remote presentation session.

One set of components that can be loaded in a remote presentation session are the console components that enable high fidelity remoting namely the components that take advantage of 3D graphics and 2D graphics rendered by 3D hardware.

3D 2D graphics rendered by 3D hardware can be accessed using a driver model that includes a user mode driver an API a graphics kernel and a kernel mode driver . An application or any other process such as a user interface that generates 3D graphics can generate API constructs and send them to an application programming interface API such as Direct3D from Microsoft . The API in turn can communicate with a user mode driver which can generates primitives e.g. the fundamental geometric shapes used in computer graphics represented as vertices and constants which are used as building blocks for other shapes and stores them in buffers e.g. pages of memory. In one embodiment the application can declare how it is going to use the buffer e.g. what type of data it is going to store in the buffer. An application such as a videogame may use a dynamic buffer to store primitives for an avatar and a static buffer for storing data that will not change often such as data that represents a building or a forest.

Continuing with the description of the driver model the application can fill the buffers with primitives and issue execute commands. When the application issues an execute command the buffer can be appended to a run list by the kernel mode driver and scheduled by the graphics kernel scheduler . Each graphics source e.g. application or user interface can have a context and its own run list. The graphics kernel can be configured to schedule various contexts to execute on the graphics processing unit . The GPU scheduler can be executed by logical processor and the scheduler can issue a command to the kernel mode driver to render the contents of the buffer. The stack instance can be configured to receive the command and send the contents of the buffer over the network to the client where the buffer can be processed by the GPU of the client.

Illustrated now is an example of the operation of a virtualized GPU as used in conjunction with an application that calls for remote presentation services. Referring to in an embodiment a virtual machine session can be generated by a computer . For example a session manager can be executed by a logical processor and a remote session that includes certain remote components can be initialized. In this example the spawned session can include a kernel a graphics kernel a user mode display driver and a kernel mode display driver . The user mode driver can generate graphics primitives that can be stored in memory. For example the API can include interfaces that can be exposed to processes such as a user interface for the operating system or an application . The process can send high level API commands such as such as Point Lists Line Lists Line Strips Triangle Lists Triangle Strips or Triangle Fans to the API . The API can receive these commands and translate them into commands for the user mode driver which can then generate vertices and store them in one or more buffers. The GPU scheduler can run and determine to render the contents of the buffer. In this example the command to the graphics processing unit of the server can be captured and the content of the buffer primitives can be sent to client via network interface card . In an embodiment an API can be exposed by the session manager that components can interface with in order to determine whether a virtual GPU is available.

In an embodiment a virtual machine such as virtual machine of or can be instantiated and the virtual machine can serve as a platform for execution for the operating system . Guest operating system can embody operating system in this example. A virtual machine may be instantiated when a connection request is received over the network. For example the parent partition may include an instance of the transport stack and may be configured to receive connection requests. The parent partition may initialize a virtual machine in response to a connection request along with a guest operating system including the capabilities to effectuate remote sessions. The connection request can then be passed to the transport stack of the guest operating system . In this example each remote session may be instantiated on an operating system that is executed by its own virtual machine.

In one embodiment a virtual machine can be instantiated and a guest operating system embodying operating system can be executed. Similar to that described above a virtual machine may be instantiated when a connection request is received over the network. Remote sessions may be generated by an operating system. The session manager can be configured to determine that the request is for a session that supports 3D graphics rendering and the session manager can load a console session. In addition to loading the console session the session manager can load a stack instance for the session and configure system to capture primitives generated by a user mode display driver .

The user mode driver may generate graphics primitives that can be captured and stored in buffers accessible to the transport stack . A kernel mode driver can append the buffers to a run list for the application and a GPU scheduler can run and determine when to issue render commands for the buffers. When the scheduler issues a render command the command can be captured by for example the kernel mode driver and sent to the client via the stack instance .

The GPU scheduler may execute and determine to issue an instruction to render the content of the buffer. In this example the graphics primitives associated with the instruction to render can be sent to client via network interface card .

In an embodiment at least one kernel mode process can be executed by at least one logical processor and the at least one logical processor can synchronize rendering vertices stored in different buffers. For example a graphics processing scheduler which can operate similarly to an operating system scheduler can schedule GPU operations. The GPU scheduler can merge separate buffers of vertices into the correct execution order such that the graphics processing unit of the client executes the commands in an order that allows them to be rendered correctly.

One or more threads of a process such as a videogame may map multiple buffers and each thread may issue a draw command. Identification information for the vertices e.g. information generated per buffer per vertex or per batch of vertices in a buffer can be sent to the GPU scheduler . The information may be stored in a table along with identification information associated with vertices from the same or other processes and used to synchronize rendering of the various buffers.

An application such as a word processing program may execute and declare for example two buffers one for storing vertices for generating 3D menus and the other one storing commands for generating letters that will populate the menus. The application may map the buffer and issue draw commands. The GPU scheduler may determine the order for executing the two buffers such that the menus are rendered along with the letters in a way that it would be pleasing to look at. For example other processes may issue draw commands at the same or a substantially similar time and if the vertices were not synchronized vertices from different threads of different processes could be rendered asynchronously on the client thereby making the final image displayed seem chaotic or jumbled.

A bulk compressor can be used to compress the graphics primitives prior to sending the stream of data to the client . In an embodiment the bulk compressor can be a user mode not shown or kernel mode component of the stack instance and can be configured to look for similar patterns within the stream of data that is being sent to the client . In this embodiment since the bulk compressor receives a stream of vertices instead of receiving multiple API constructs from multiple applications the bulk compressor has a larger data set of vertices to sift through in order to find opportunities to compress. That is since the vertices for a plurality of processes are being remoted instead of diverse API calls there is a larger chance that the bulk compressor will be able to find similar patterns in a given stream.

In an embodiment the graphics processing unit may be configured to use virtual addressing instead of physical addresses for memory. Thus the pages of memory used as buffers can be paged to system RAM or to disk from video memory. The stack instance can be configured to obtain the virtual addresses of the buffers and send the contents from the virtual addresses when a render command from the graphics kernel is captured.

An operating system may be configured e.g. various subsystems and drivers can be loaded to capture primitives and send them to a remote computer such as client . Similar to that described above a session manager can be executed by a logical processor and a session that includes certain remote components can be initialized. In this example the spawned session can include a kernel a graphics kernel a user mode display driver and a kernel mode display driver .

A graphics kernel may schedule GPU operations. The GPU scheduler can merge separate buffers of vertices into the correct execution order such that the graphics processing unit of the client executes the commands in an order that allows them to be rendered correctly.

All of these variations for implementing the above mentioned partitions are just exemplary implementations and nothing herein should be interpreted as limiting the disclosure to any particular virtualization aspect.

The process of compressing encoding and decoding graphics data as referring to herein may generally use one or more methods and systems described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7 460 725 entitled System And Method For Effectively Encoding And Decoding Electronic Information hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In various methods and systems disclosed herein improvements to the transmission of remote presentation graphics data to a client computer may be implemented to provide a more timely and rich user experience in particular when providing a remote presentation session to a client computer in a virtual machine environment. The embodiments disclosed herein for encoding and transmitting graphics data may be implemented using various combinations of hardware and software processes. In some embodiments functions may be executed entirely in hardware. In other embodiments functions may be performed entirely in software. In yet further embodiments functions may be implemented using a combination of hardware and software processes. Such processes may further be implemented using one or more CPUs and or one or more specialized processors such as a graphics processing unit GPU or other dedicated graphics rendering devices.

As discussed above a video frame may be logically partitioned into a plurality of smaller tiles. The client screen data may be arranged using a variety of schemes. Each frame may be captured however only the changed tiles may be processed according to the processes disclosed above. For example referring to a virtual frame to be transmitted to the encoding system may comprise sixteen client frames. An exemplary client screen may further be divided into twenty tiles and encoded using the techniques described herein.

In another embodiment a changed tile mode may be provided that tracks which tiles have changed and providing only the changed tiles to the encoding engine for processing. For example the CPU may keep track of which tiles are changed and only the changed tiles may be provided for further processing. For example 4 5 tiles may be implemented for a screen. In this embodiment only tiles that changed may be transferred for that screen. Referring to frame may include three changed tiles and emphasized by bolded and underlined tile numbers . Frame may include two changed tiles and . Frame may include five changed tiles and . The resulting sequence of tiles sent to the encoding system may include the set of changed tiles from the three frames including tiles and .

Various methods may be used to transfer the changed tiles. For example the changed tiles may be bit block transferred to the display frame and sent across the link to the encoding engine. In this fashion changed tiles from multiple clients can be included within a server display frame. The tiles may further be embedded with information on which client the tile belongs. In an embodiment the first tile row may be used to provide information about the rest of the tiles such as client association frame number tile offset and the like.

The methods disclosed herein are not limited to a particular type of graphics data such as bitmaps. The disclosed methods can apply to any type of graphic object. For example the graphics data may comprise a description of entities to be drawn. Generally the lossless channel can be used to notify the client of the type and nature of the data that will be transmitted and the expected result after rendering. The actual graphics data can then be transmitted to the client on the lossy channel and the client can compare what was actually received and the result of the rendering actions to determine if any data was missing or if there is a discrepancy between what was expected in the received data or as a result of performing the expected actions on the data. In one embodiment the client can note any transactions not received or screen areas that have not been updated and notify the server of the discrepancy. In other embodiments the client make some intelligent decisions such as determining that only a small portion of the screen is missing and determining to wait longer for the missing data or determine that the data is not needed.

The disclosed techniques may be applied to multiple monitor scenarios. A component on the server may for example determine the number of video presentation paths from the video presentation network information as maintained by the server. Each video presentation source may be provided with a set of video data as described above.

When providing remote presentation of graphics data two types of remoting techniques may be used. One technique is based on updating and transmitting the frames and the other technique is based on rendering the frames and sending the bitmaps of the rendered frames. Referring to in the first technique a frame may be captured in a frame buffer . The captured frame data may then passed to a remote presentation process for encoding and other processes that produce a remote presentation network stream comprising bitmap data. A bitmap is a portion of data used to represent an image and is typically a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels that can be rendered on a client computer. A bitmap may be stored in an image file of various formats such as .bmp .jpg and .png. A bitmap may correspond to an image displayed on a screen or a portion of such an image.

Referring to in the other technique a number of types of components in the system may be used for producing primitives. For example GDI DirectX Media and Flash and other functions may each produce a stream of high level rendering commands which are called primitives. The primitives may then be passed to a remote presentation primitive encoder which performs data transformation compression caching etc. A primitive stream is provided that in some cases will result in higher level commands providing more efficient performance as compared to the first technique.

Both techniques are characterized by various advantages and disadvantages. It would be advantageous to combine the features of the two techniques to provide a method and system that incorporates the benefits of both techniques. For example when using the RDP protocol it would be beneficial to receive from the system high level primitives e.g. commands such as DrawText or indications such as a window that has moved or scrolled . However such a system may not be compatible with the general trend of graphics stacks and the rise of a multitude of proprietary graphics remoting layers that make it impractical for the system to provide RDP with high level primitives for bitmap operations.

Furthermore existing systems are configured such that the set of primitives needed by the remote presentation protocol would result in a high volume of primitives that may be impractical to remote because the bandwidth required would be very high.

Disclosed herein is a technique in which bitmaps are transmitted but provides improvements to bitmap data transmission by using some of the advantages of primitive remoting thus allowing for the reduction of the bandwidth and processing needed to remote a virtual desktop experience. In an embodiment rendering is performed and bitmaps are remoted but metadata comprising shortcuts or hints are provided to assist in the rendering of the bitmap data. For example the metadata may provide useful information to describe the transition from one set of bitmap data to another. In various embodiments such an extension to a remote presentation protocol can include the following attributes 

1. Efficient direct access to the final rendered content on the screen i.e. the frame buffer . This access may be direct video memory access through a mapped view or alternative mechanism.

a. Efficient indications of the dirty or changed rectangles or tiles i.e. what has changed from frame to frame.

c. Metadata hints that inform the remoting driver what structurally has happened to create that bitmap. Some examples include 

Once the remote presentation driver has determined the metadata the metadata and any bitmap data can be transmitted to the client. The remote presentation protocol can thus make use of the metadata to improve the remoting experience. As an example the remote presentation protocol can generally follow the form of using the metadata to encode a small remote presentation order such as Copy Screen from RECT A to RECT B instead of sending the corresponding bitmap contents for RECT A and RECT B.

Accordingly it may not be necessary to send the bitmap data for an entire screen frame if the frame can be rendered using a portion of the bitmap data or based on previously transmitted data. In various embodiments a set of embedded primitives can be sent that allow for transitioning from a first bitmap of a first frame to a second bitmap of a second frame without sending all of the bitmap data. For example a first frame may depict a screen for a user using a Microsoft Word application with an open document. In the second frame the screen may represent the same view of the Word document but scrolled one line down. If a full bitmap implementation is being used then the entire screen as represented by a bitmap must be sent because on a pixel by pixel basis the entire screen has changed. However using primitives such a system may only have to send a reference to the previous frame and the direction and magnitude of movement of the screen as well as the new bitmap data for the bottom area of the screen that has changed. The changed areas can be sent using bitmap data but the majority of the screen can be rendered with reference to the previously sent data and a description of the change of the screen view.

In one embodiment the remote presentation encoder may determine the metadata i.e. primitives or hints to be provided to the client and how to efficiently encode the hints. The hints can comprise various types of descriptors that may include graphics primitives. For example the hints can be graphics motion hints that describe how the current window is moving from frame to frame. As a result it will not be necessary to encode the bitmap in its entirety. Rather a hint can be sent that describes how the screen should be moved and the encoder may only send any new data that the client has not previously received. It can be appreciated that the metadata can comprise any type of information useful for rendering a client screen using previously sent bitmap data or a portion of current bitmap data. Examples include but are not limited to 3 D commands describing the rotation of an object or changing of a view point.

Referring to in one embodiment a hybrid method or system can be implemented that incorporates both the full bitmap and graphics primitive encoding techniques. Many current remote presentation systems do not provide access to such metadata in the context of bitmap streams. In an embodiment such primitives may be obtained from various system layers to augment bitmaps from a graphics source with metadata for the most high value operations. An encoder may be provided that augments bitmap data with one or more hints from among a predetermined set of metadata that can be transmitted into the remote presentation bitmap stream with the bitmap data. In one embodiment the predetermined set of metadata can comprise a smaller subset of the full set of primitive commands that typically make up such command sets for graphics rendering systems. Such a subset may comprise for example twenty or thirty of the most high value commands as compared to the hundreds of commands that may be available.

In an embodiment a remote presentation encoder may be provided that receives information from rendering subsystems to determine a set of metadata that describes actions performed to produce a bitmap. The encoder may be configured to determine based on the received information whether a portion of the bitmap data or all of the bitmap data should be placed on the remote presentation bitmap stream and which metadata should be encoded into the data stream. In some cases no additional bitmap data may need to be sent e.g. when the next frame can be rendered entirely as a function of previously received bitmap data .

In some cases the metadata can be used to determine that part or all of the bitmap data will be used for future rendering and therefore that the data should be cached for later use. For example if part of the bitmap data represents a portion of the screen that will now be hidden behind another on screen object the metadata can include indications of this rendering action. The downstream system can use this information to determine that the hidden bitmap data can be cached so that when the front object is moved the previously hidden bitmap which has been cached can be used to restore the hidden area without the need to receive the bitmap data from the remote presentation server.

The metadata can also be used to describe all of the changes between frames. For example the metadata can include indications that only a certain part of the screen has changed in which case the client can apply processing to only the changed areas. In some embodiments graphics APIs can provide the information that can be used to determine the metadata.
