This Application relates to a provisional patent application Ser. No. 60 900 308 entitled Conversion of a Salt Halide to a Nitrate Salt by the same inventors filed in the USPTO on 6 Feb. 2007. This application is a Divisional of its parent application now allowed Ser. No.12 075 288 of the same title and inventors filed on Jan. 31 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 820 347.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

An alkylated triazolium based nitrate salt has potential in propulsion and or explosives applications. One of the current major drawbacks in commercializing these so called ionic liquids or low melting salts is the use of silver salts as ion exchange agents. Use of silver introduces high cost along with light sensitivity and residual contamination. The elimination of silver salts would decrease the cost of production and virtually eliminate heavy metal waste and contamination.

Accordingly there is need and market for preparing the above family of salts without the need for silver salts therewith in a more streamlined process of reduced costs.

There has now been developed an efficient method to produce the above family of salts free from the use of silver salts therewith.

Broadly the present invention provides a method for preparing isomerically pure alkylated triazolium based nitrate salts including reacting substituted amino 1 2 4 triazolium and 1 2 3 triazolium halides with dinitrogen tetroxide.

The invention further provides salts formed by the above method including alkylated triazolium based nitrate salts comprising 1 hydroxyethyl 1 2 4 triazolium nitrate 1 propionitrile 1 2 4 triazolium nitrate 1 acetonitrile 1 2 4 triazolium nitrate or 1 propyl 1 2 3 triazolium nitrate or combinations thereof.

These inventive compounds are also useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical and agricultural agents also as highly energetic compounds for explosives propellants and gas generating compositions and formulations.

Three 1 R 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromides R hydroxyethyl propionitrile acetonitrile and 1 amino 3 propyl 1 2 3 triazolium bromide were chosen for an initial evaluation of the process. In a typical experiment a frozen mixture of a triazolium halide in excess NOwas allowed to slowly warm from 196 C. LN to ambient temperature. Preliminary investigations of the products showed that in all four cases nitrate salts were produced but that the cations were also affected. The actual composition of the products was only revealed after detailed studies by mass balance Raman IR multinuclear NMR spectroscopy DSC elemental and X ray analysis. Besides a halide nitrate exchange the reactions in neat NOalso caused cleavage of the amino group attached to the heterocycles. The final salts represent simple alkylated 1 2 4 and 1 2 3 triazolium nitrates. These results are notable because a regiospecific alkylation of simple triazoles has always provided a synthetic challenge. Generally ratios of the two possible isomers vary between 90 to 10 and 70 to 30 depending on the alkylating agent and conditions.

The following examples serve to illustrate the method of the present invention and should not be construed in limitation thereof.

0.44 g 2.11 mmol of 1 hydroxyethyl 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide were added to a 20 mL glass reaction vessel equipped with a Kontes Teflon valve. The vessel was connected to a glass vacuum line and evacuated. 4.01 g 43.61 mmol dinitrogentetroxide were condensed on top of the 1 hydroxyethyl 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide at 196 C. The frozen reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 10 15 min at ambient temperature all volatiles were removed in a dynamic vacuum. The remaining residue was dissolved in methanol and layered with diethylether. The product crystallized out over night was filtered washed with diethylether and dried in a dynamic vacuum. The material was identified by H C N NMR spectroscopy by DSC elemental and X ray analysis.

0.28 g 1.28 mmol of 1 propionitrile 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide were added to a 20 mL glass reaction vessel equipped with a Kontes Teflon valve. The vessel was connected to a glass vacuum line and evacuated. 2.73 g 29.71 mmol dinitrogentetroxide were condensed on top of the 1 propionitrile 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide at 196 C. The frozen reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 10 15 min at ambient temperature all volatiles were removed in a dynamic vacuum. The remaining residue was dissolved in methanol and layered with diethylether. The product crystallized out over night was filtered washed with diethylether and dried in a dynamic vacuum. The material was identified by H C N NMR spectroscopy by DSC and X ray analysis.

0.35 g 1.70 mmol of 1 acetonitrile 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide were added to a 20 mL glass reaction vessel equipped with a Kontes Teflon valve. The vessel was connected to a glass vacuum line and evacuated. 3.13 g 34.06 mmol dinitrogentetroxide were condensed on top of the 1 acetonitrile 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium bromide at 196 C. The frozen reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 10 15 min at ambient temperature all volatiles were removed in a dynamic vacuum. The remaining residue was dissolved in methanol and layered with diethylether. The product crystallized out over night was filtered washed with diethylether and dried in a dynamic vacuum. The material was identified by H C N NMR spectroscopy by DSC and X ray analysis.

0.38 g 1.85 mmol of 1 amino 3 propyl 1 2 3 triazolium bromide were added to a 20 mL glass reaction vessel equipped with a Kontes Teflon valve. The vessel was connected to a glass vacuum line and evacuated. 3.29 g 35.7 mmol dinitrogentetroxide were condensed on top of the 1 amino 3 propyl 1 2 3 triazolium bromide at 196 C. The frozen reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 10 15 min at ambient temperature all volatiles were removed in a dynamic vacuum. The remaining residue was dissolved in methanol and layered with diethylether. In this case no crystallization occurred. Upon pumping off the volatiles in a dynamic vacuum a solid was left behind. The mp was determined by DSC to 36.5 C. The material was identified by H C N NMR spectroscopy and by DSC analysis.

The present invention thus provides an effective method for making the above nitrate salts through a facile synthesis route in high yields and purity.

Accordingly it can be seen that amino triazolium halide salts in NO form isomerically pure compounds in a single step reaction. That is a one step conversion without the use of silver salts and without residual contamination of a substituted amino triazolium heterocyclic salt halide to the corresponding substituted triazolium nitrate is described.

The above nitrate salts of the invention have potential in propulsion and or explosive applications. The above salts offer the potential for improved propulsion performance and explosive power. Also the performance cost and safety property aspects of these new ingredients can find use in commercial propellant and or explosive applications.

Further this approach of making isomerically pure alkylated triazolium salts could well be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. That is the production of isomer pure alkylated triazoles is also of use in the production of certain pharmaceuticals.
