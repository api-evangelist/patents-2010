This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 312 415 filed Mar. 10 2010 and entitled Method and System for Enhancing Capability of Distributed Antenna System. 

This invention relates in general to wireless networks and more particularly to a system and method for implementing power distribution.

Distributed antenna systems consist of a base station also known as a Radio Element Control or a Baseband Unit and one or more remote transceivers also known as Radio Elements or Remote Radio Heads . These components provide endpoints with wireless network access. To aid the distributed antenna system in distinguishing between the various wireless transmissions to and from the various endpoints each endpoint may have one or more unique subcarriers assigned thereto.

Within a distributed antenna system the remote transceivers are distributed around different locations while being connected via a wired connection e.g. optical fiber to the base station. Wile there may be multiple remote transceivers from the perspective of an endpoint there is only one entity the base station. That is each remote transceiver transmits essentially the same core data and the endpoint combines multiple signals from multiple remote transceivers into a single communication.

The base station communicates with the remote transceivers using for example the Common Public Radio Interface CPRI standard. The CPRI standard allows in phase quadrature I Q data to be transmitted from the base station to the remote transceivers. The remote transceivers use the I Q data to form the transmissions that are sent to any endpoints connected thereto. The remote transceivers are also able to communicate with the base station using the CPRI standard. This allows the remote transceivers to relay data received from the endpoints and to communicate control information such as signal quality to the base station.

In accordance with a particular embodiment a method for adjusting power distribution that includes establishing a connection between a base station and a plurality of remote transceivers. The method also includes establishing a plurality of wireless connections with a plurality of endpoints via one or more of the plurality of remote transceivers. The method further includes receiving a signal quality indication from each of the plurality of remote transceivers for any endpoint for which the remote transceiver is able to receive a wireless communication. The method additionally includes determining a power distribution for the plurality of remote transceivers based on the received signal quality indication from each of the remote transceivers. The method also includes transmitting a control signal to the plurality of remote transceivers. The control signal comprises the power distribution and is indicative of the amount of power each remote transceiver is to use for each endpoint when transmitting wireless communications.

Technical advantages of particular embodiments may include providing power distribution to multiple remote transceivers using a relatively low CPRI link rate. Another technical advantage of particular embodiments includes increasing the uplink and downlink capacity of a distributed antennae system. Yet another technical advantage or certain embodiments is that remote transceiver specific reference signals may not be applied at different remote transceivers the same reference signal is sent by all remote transceivers e.g. the endpoints see all the remote transceivers as a single base station . Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures descriptions and claims. Moreover while specific advantages have been enumerated above various embodiments may include all some or none of the enumerated advantages.

Distributed antenna system may be coupled to network via base station . Distributed antenna system provides wireless coverage for endpoints over a large geographic area. For example a single base station e.g. base station and a plurality of remote transceivers e.g. remote transceivers may be used to provide wireless coverage for an entire building. Because remote transceivers are distributed over a geographical area the distance between an endpoint and each remote transceiver may be different. In particular embodiments the signal quality between an endpoint and a remote transceiver may generally increase as the endpoint gets closer to the remote transceiver. Particular embodiments may take advantage of this increased signal quality by increasing the transmission power for the subcarriers associated with the signal having the better quality. Because a remote transceiver has a finite amount of transmission power an increase in power for a particular subcarrier may be balanced by a corresponding decrease in power of another subcarrier.

Depending on the embodiment distributed antenna system may use any of a variety of wireless technologies or protocols e.g. IEEE 802.16m or 802.16e or long term evolution LTE for communications between remote transceivers and endpoints . The multiple remote transceivers appear to endpoints as a single entity an extension of base station . Thus each remote transceiver may attempt to send the same core data to endpoints and may potentially receive the same data from endpoints . The differences in the data that is sent or received may be the result of the respective distances of each remote transceiver from a particular endpoint and as will be discussed in more detail below the amount of power applied to each subcarrier at each remote transceiver.

Depending on the embodiment distributed antenna system may use any of a variety of different wired technologies or protocols e.g. CPRI for communications between remote transceivers and base station . In particular embodiments base station may be configured to adjust the power either directly e.g. incorporating the power distribution in the I Q samples that are sent to the remote transceivers or indirectly e.g. providing power distribution values to each remote transceiver from which the remote transceivers can determine their respective power distribution that each remote transceiver applies to its transmissions. By selectively increasing or decreasing the transmission power for particular sub carriers associated with particular endpoints at particular remote transceivers base station may be able to more efficiently use the available wireless resources.

Depending on the embodiment base station may use signal quality information from the various remote transceivers to determine the power distribution for each sub carrier for each remote transceiver . The signal quality information may include the received uplink power strength the maximal usable modulation and coding scheme MCS level the Carrier to Interference plus Noise Ratio CINR of the wireless connection. In particular embodiments uplink sounding may be used to estimate the channel gain and interference strength between endpoints and remote transceivers .

Network may be any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals data and or messages including signals data or messages transmitted through WebPages e mail text chat voice over IP VoIP and instant messaging. Network may include one or more LANs WANs MANs PSTNs WiMAX networks global distributed networks such as the Internet Intranet Extranet or any other form of wireless or wired networking. Network may use any of a variety of protocols for either wired or wireless communication.

Base station may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets in distributed antenna system . Base station may be configured to determine and distribute a power distribution to each remote transceiver . Depending on the embodiment base station may apply the power distribution to the data before it is sent to the remote transceivers for transmission or base station may send the power distribution to each remote transceiver to allow them to each individually apply the power distribution.

Remote transceivers may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets with endpoints in distributed antenna system . In some embodiments remote transceivers receive data from base station that may already include the power distribution determinations made by base station . In particular embodiments each remote transceiver may adjust the transmission power of the core data received from base station . In such an embodiment each remote transceiver receives the same core data and one or more control signals sent from base station specifying the transmission power for each sub carrier or plurality of sub carriers at each respective remote transceiver . Remote transceivers may then apply the power distribution to the core data before sending communications to endpoints .

Endpoints may comprise any type of wireless device able to send and receive data and or signals to and from base station via remote transceivers . Some possible types of endpoints may include desktop computers PDAs cell phones smart phones laptops and or VoIP phones. Endpoints may provide data or network services to a user through any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . Endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that can send or receive data and or signals.

The following example may help illustrate particular features of certain embodiments. For purposes of this example assume that base station only controls two remote transceivers remote transceivers and . Further assume that endpoints and are both located in the area served by remote transceivers and . To simplify the scenario assume that the scheduling algorithm at base station allocates the same number of subcarriers in a frame to each of endpoints and . Further assume that the magnitude of the channel gain between remote transceiver and endpoint is twice that of remote transceiver and endpoint and that the magnitude of the channel gain between remote transceiver and endpoint is twice that of remote transceiver and endpoint . Then based on these assumptions base station may allocate of remote transceiver s power to the subcarriers used by endpoint and to the subcarriers used by endpoint as opposed to the even and distribution of a standard distributed antenna system . Similarly base station may allocate of remote transceiver s power to the subcarriers used by endpoint and to the subcarriers used by endpoint

The components and devices illustrated in form distributed antenna system . From the perspective of an endpoint distributed antenna system may be perceived as a single base station. An endpoint may be unable to distinguish between a wireless transmission sent by a remote transceiver and a wireless transmission sent by a base station. The channel experienced by an endpoint is the sum of the channel responses from each of remote transceivers .

In particular embodiments base station may communicate with remote transceivers using Common Public Radio Interface CPRI . The CPRI specification supports a variety of topologies including ring tree star and chain topologies. Regardless of the topology CPRI allows multiple remote transceivers to be controlled by the same base station . In some embodiments the CPRI link may be used by base station to send receive different in phase quadrature I Q data to from each different remote transceivers . For example in some embodiments base station may apply power distribution locally to data before it is sent out to the remote transceivers. This may result in each remote transceiver needing its own unique I Q sample. In particular embodiments the CPRI link may be used to send receive a single set of I Q samples from remote transceivers . For example in some embodiments the power distribution may be applied individually at each respective remote transceiver. This may allow a single I Q sample to be used by all remote transceivers .

The allocation of power to different subcarriers at different remote transceivers in the power distribution may be based on channel response information associated with each endpoint at each remote transceiver . In particular embodiments base station may allocate more power to those endpoints having better channel quality at each respective remote transceiver.

Depending on the embodiment there may be at least three components used to determine channel response path loss shadowing and multipath. In contrast with shadowing and multipath effects which are often random processes path loss is the most dominant component in the channel response. Path loss may be a function of the distance between an endpoint and a remote transceiver. The closer an endpoint is to a particular remote transceiver the higher the channel gain is between the endpoint and the remote transceiver. In distributed antenna system the varying distances between an endpoint and each remote transceiver may result in varying path losses and channel gains between remote transceivers and a particular endpoint.

In particular embodiments the closer an endpoint is to a remote transceiver the greater the power that will be allocated to the subcarriers associated with the endpoint. Conversely the farther an endpoint is from a remote transceiver the less power that will be allocated to subcarriers associated with the endpoint. This may allow each remote transceiver to more efficiently use their available transmission power. The non uniform power distribution to different subcarriers could enhance the signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR at the endpoint by increasing the received signal strength from the closer remote transceivers while the loss of signal strength due to the reduced power from a more distant remote transceiver may be insignificant.

In particular embodiments each remote transceiver may measure the average received power of the subcarriers allocated to each endpoint. This information may then be delivered to base station over a CPRI control channel. Base station may use the measured uplink power to approximate the downlink channel response between each remote transceiver and the endpoints. This estimation may be used by base station to determine the power distribution which base station may then send to remote transceivers using the CPRI control channel.

In some embodiments each remote transceiver may send their own respective I Q data along with I Q data received from the upstream remote transceiver. Base station may use the individual I Q samples to estimate the received downlink power at the endpoint e.g. it may be proportional to the determined uplink power . Using this estimated power base station may determine and apply an amount of amplification or attenuation to the download signal. This may be done without adjusting the phase of the download signal. The amplified data may then be sent to remote transceivers as individual I Q data.

In certain embodiments before base station allocates the power distribution it first executes a scheduling algorithm to allocate subcarriers within a channel to the different endpoints. Once the subcarriers have been assigned base station may use the measured uplink power received from remote transceivers to redistribute the downlink power to maximize system capacity. Depending on the embodiment and or scenario base station could use any of a variety of strategies to apply power distribution. For example base station may use a strategy similar to maximum ratio combination MRC . In this scenario the allocated downlink power of a subcarrier at a particular remote transceiver e.g. remote transceiver is made to be proportional to the uplink channel gain of the same subcarrier measured at the same particular remote transceiver e.g. remote transceiver . As another example base station may maximize system capacity by solving an optimization problem such as 

In the above optimization formulation 1 Smay represent the number of subcarriers allocated to the u th end point 2 G g may represent the square of the common power amplification factor at the r th remote transceiver for all the subcarriers allocated to the u th end point 3 Pmay represent the average of the received uplink power of a subcarrier allocated to the u th end point at the r th remote transceiver 4 c may represent a constant used to calibrate the differences between the transmitting and receiving antenna gains of downlink and uplink connections 5 Nmay represent the number of the transmitting antennas at each remote transceiver 6 Nmay represent the number of the remote transceivers controlled by a base station in a cell 7 Nmay represent the number of end points that are scheduled in one transmission timing interval TTI 8 Nmay represent the number of interference base stations 9 may represent the variance of the noise power per subcarrier 10 N may represent the number of points of FFT Fast Fourier Transform in a channel which may be the same as the number of subcarriers in a channel and 11 the term of the log function ln . may represent the average estimated per subcarrier capacity at the u th end point. It may be the case that the symbols in the formulation above represent mostly given parameters with G r 1 . . . N and u 1 . . . N being the variables in the formulation.

The objective function of the above formulation may be to maximize the overall system capacity. The system capacity may be based on the sum of the estimated capacity of all the end points connected to base station . The first set of constraint functions may limit the total transmission power at each remote transceiver to be less than or equal to a maximum transmission power P. The constraint functions are derived from the following inequality 1 . . . Where Pis the power assigned to the k th subcarrier of the r th remote transceiver before the power amplification operation. Because prior to the power amplification operation all the subcarriers have equal power Pbe presented as P N. Moreover in certain embodiments the power amplification gains for different subcarriers allocated to the same end point may be set to be the same. This may allow the inequality to be simplified to the constraint functions in the optimization problem. The second set of constraint functions may ensure the positive or zero power amplification gains computed from the optimization problem.

Once base station has determined how to allocate the downlink power for the various subcarriers at each remote transceiver the power distribution may be applied either at base station or at remote transceivers . For example in some embodiments base station may generate I Q data for each remote transceiver that includes the power core data modified by the power distribution this may be done in the frequency domain before base station performs Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform IDFT operations . This may scale the data of frequency domain before IDFT up or down proportionally such that the total power of each remote transceiver does not exceed its capabilities.

In some embodiments base station receives a combined uplink signal from remote transceivers . For example remote transceiver may send its received uplink signal to remote transceiver . Remote transceiver may combine its own received uplink signal with the uplink signal from remote transceiver . The combined uplink signal may then be sent to remote transceiver for remote transceiver to combine with its received uplink signal. The combined uplink signal from all three remote transceivers may then be sent to base station . Accordingly base station may only receive one combined uplink I Q sample and not individual I Q samples from each remote transceiver .

In certain embodiments base station may enhance uplink capacity via Maximum Ratio Combining MRC . This may be achieved in part by determining the received signal power of the subcarriers allocated to each endpoint. Base station may further use MRC in processing each I Q data sample sent from each of remote transceivers . This may improve the array gain associated with the multiple receiving entities of remote transceivers .

In particular embodiments base station may apply the power distribution to the core data g k square root over G k before Inverse Fast Fourier Transform IFFT is applied. Both power amplification and IFFT may be done locally at base station . This may result in base station sending different I Q data to each remote transceiver . This may increase the data rate of the CPRI link. However because base station is sending different I Q data specific for each remote transceiver it may be possible to use standard remote transceivers without having to modify them to be able to make power adjustments based on a power distribution from base station . In particular embodiments the MRC power amplification determination FFTs to process I Q samples received from remote transceivers and the IFFTs to process I Q samples to be sent to remote transceivers may be performed by discrete modules designed specifically for each respective task. In some embodiments one or more of these features may be performed by a combination of one or more of processor memory storage bus and interface .

In particular embodiments each remote transceiver may apply the power distribution and perform IFFT locally. This may allow base station to send the same frequency domain data to each remote transceiver . This may reduce the data rate needed for the CPRI link. In certain embodiments in addition to the frequency domain I Q data base station may also send the downlink scheduling information e.g. the set of subchannels subcarriers assigned to each endpoint in the transmission time interval TTI and the power distribution for each endpoint. In particular embodiments both pieces of information may be carried over the CPRI control session or CPRI control channel. The amount of data for both power amplification gain and scheduling information is much less compared to I Q data.

In particular embodiments each remote transceiver may combine its own I Q data with the I Q data it receives from an upstream remote transceiver . The combined I Q data may then be passed to the next remote transceiver downstream towards base station . Because base station receives only a single set of I Q data based on the combination of the I Q data from each of remote transceivers base station may not be able to use the received I Q data to determine the power amplification distribution. However in certain embodiments remote transceivers may compute the average received power from particular endpoints and send this information to base station via a CPRI control signal. In some embodiments computing the received power from an endpoint may include using scheduling information from base station . In particular embodiments FFT operations may be performed at each remote transceiver thereby relieving base station of the task of performing FFT. In some embodiments remote transceivers may compute the average received power after FFT is conducted. In particular embodiments remote transceivers may comprise one or more discrete hardware modules for computing the average received power and or performing the FFT. In particular embodiments these tasks may be performed by a combination of processor memory storage and or interface .

Thus far several different embodiments and features have been presented. Particular embodiments may combine one or more of these features depending on operational needs and or component limitations. This may allow for great adaptability of distributed antenna system to the needs of various organizations and users. Some embodiments may include additional features.

At step a plurality of wireless connections are established with a plurality of endpoints. The wireless connections are established via one or more of the plurality of remote transceivers. While each endpoint from its perspective may have established a single wireless connection with a single base station each endpoint may actually be sending and receiving communications from a number of remote transceivers. When an endpoint receives multiple wireless signals from multiple remote transceivers it may perform various techniques for deriving the core data from the multiple wireless signals. For example in some embodiments an endpoint may combine two or more wireless signals from two or more remote transceivers each wireless signal comprises a copy of the same core data .

At step a signal quality indication is received from each of the plurality of remote transceivers. Each signal quality indication may comprise information from which the base station may be able to determine the relative quality strength and or efficiency of a wireless connection between the respective remote transceiver and each endpoint of the plurality of endpoints. For example if a particular remote transceiver is able to receive a signal from two endpoints the signal quality indication sent from the particular remote transceiver would include information regarding the relative quality strength and or efficiency of a wireless connection with both of the two endpoints. In some embodiments each remote transceiver may compute the average received power from each of the plurality of endpoints. This may be sent to the base station as a signal quality indication. In particular embodiments the signal quality indication may be communicated from the remote transceivers to the base station over a CPRI control channel.

At step the combined data from the remote transceivers is received by the base station. The combined data may comprise a single data set formed from each data set received at each of the respective remote transceivers. In certain embodiments the combined data may be created through a series of repeating steps in which each remote transceiver receives the combined data from an upstream remote transceiver combines the received combined data with its own received data and then sends the new combined data downstream to the next remote transceiver. The first remote transceiver in the chain may simply send its received data to the downstream remote transceiver and the last remote transceiver may send its combined data to the base station. The combined data may be sent over a CPRI data channel. Because only one data set is communicated at a time the bandwidth requirements for the CPRI data channel may be much less compared to systems in which each remote transceiver sends its own respective data to the base station without combining it with other data sets.

At step a power distribution is determined for the plurality of remote transceivers. The power distribution may be based at least in part on the received signal quality indication from each of the remote transceivers. The power distribution determines the amount of amplification each remote transceiver is to apply to each respective sub carrier when transmitting wireless communications to each of the endpoints. In certain embodiments the better e.g. stronger clearer more efficient a wireless signal is between a remote transceiver and an endpoint the greater the amount of power that will be distributed to the remote transceiver to use in communicating with the endpoint conversely the worse a wireless signal is the less power that will be distributed to the remote transceiver to use to communicate with the endpoint. For convenience the result of applying the power distribution to the core data may be referred to as the modified data.

In certain embodiments once the base station has made its determination for how each remote transceiver is to allocate power among the plurality of endpoints the base station may encode the information into a control signal. The control signal may be transmitted at step . The control signal may provide each remote transceiver with information indicative of how the remote transceiver is to allocate or distribute power among the plurality of sub carriers used by the plurality of remote transceivers. In some embodiments the control signal may be sent via a CPRI control channel.

At step the base station transmits a data signal. The same data signal may be sent to each of the remote transceivers. For example in some embodiments each of the remote transceivers may receive the same core data to be transmitted to each of the plurality of endpoints. The core data may be sent to the remote transceivers using a CPRI data channel.

At step the data signal may be modified based on the control signal. This may be done individually at each remote transceiver. This may result in each remote transceiver transmitting a different signal. For example while each remote transceiver may receive the same core data in the data signal each remote transceiver may receive a different power distribution in the control signal. When the power distribution is applied to modify the data signal the resulting signal may be different for each remote transceiver. In some embodiments each remote transceiver may perform its own respective inverse fast Fourier transform to generate the modified data signal. At step the modified data signal is transmitted to the plurality of endpoints.
