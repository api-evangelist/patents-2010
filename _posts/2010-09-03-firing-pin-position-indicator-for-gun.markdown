The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to guns such as for example mortars and artillery.

When using a 120 mm breech loaded mortar weapon for example the rounds ammunition may sometime misfire. It is difficult to determine if the round has been struck by the firing pin or if the firing pin has been damaged. The mortar weapon may use a revolving firing pin. A suitable revolving firing pin is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 008 782 filed on Jan. 10 2008 which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

The revolving firing pin may be aligned to strike the round only when the mortar system breech block is closed and locked. A prior firing pin solenoid was not attached to the firing pin. Thus the firing pin position could not be seen from outside of the breech mechanism. And there was no indication of what did or did not occur in the mortar system when a round misfired. Because of the danger of a slow burn the breech block could not be immediately opened after a misfire. After waiting a period of time for example ten minutes the breech block could be opened to inspect the firing pin and determine the cause of the misfire.

A need exists for an apparatus to provide an indication of the cause of a misfire in a breech loaded weapon.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for providing an indication of the cause of a misfire in a breech loaded weapon.

One aspect of the invention is a firing pin position indicator. The firing pin indicator may be mounted to the breech end of a weapon. The firing pin indicator may include a solenoid having a plunger and a firing pin adapter. The firing pin adapter may be selectively engageable with the plunger. The firing pin adapter may be selectively translatable with the plunger. The firing pin adapter may be selectively rotatable with the plunger.

The plunger may be coupled to a quick release lock. The quick release lock may be selectively engageable with the firing pin adapter. The quick release lock may include a spring loaded piston that may be translatable in a quick release lock housing. The quick release lock housing may be coupled to the plunger with a pin.

The quick release lock may include a drive ball. In a first position of the drive ball the quick release lock may be engaged with the firing pin adapter. In a second position of the drive ball the quick release lock may not be engaged with the firing pin adapter.

The plunger may include a plunger extension and the quick release lock housing may be coupled to the plunger extension with the pin. The plunger extension may include a through bore. The quick release lock may be at least partially disposed in the through bore. The firing pin position indicator may further include a quick release lock actuator pin at least partially disposed in the through bore and translatable in the through bore. The quick release lock actuator pin may be engageable with a head of the spring loaded piston of the quick release lock.

The firing pin position indicator may include a sensor for sensing a position of the plunger. The sensor may be for example a proximity sensor.

Another aspect of the invention is a firing pin position indicator mounted to the breech end of a weapon. The weapon may include a firing pin. The firing pin position indicator may include a solenoid with a plunger and a firing pin adapter connected to the firing pin of the weapon. The firing pin adaptor may be selectively engageable with the plunger.

A further aspect of the invention is a weapon with a breech end. The weapon may include a firing pin position indicator mounted to the breech end. The firing pin position indicator may include a solenoid with a plunger and a firing pin adapter that is selectively engageable with the plunger. The firing pin may be connected to the firing pin adapter.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A firing pin indicator may be mounted to the rear of the carrier of a breech loaded weapon. The firing pin indicator may be attached to the firing pin of the weapon. The firing pin indicator may indicate the position of the firing pin. The firing pin may be out of view because the firing pin is within the carrier housing. The firing pin indicator may be in view of the operator of the weapon. The firing pin indicator may include a flexible strip. The flexible strip may be sensed by for example a proximity sensor. The flexible strip may be made of metal. The weapon may shut down if the strip is not sensed by a sensor or seen by the operator of the weapon.

Firing pin adapter may include the function of the firing pin guide disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 008 782 referenced above.

Quick release lock may include a housing and a spring loaded piston . Spring may load piston . Spring loaded piston may be translatable in quick release lock housing . Quick release lock housing may be coupled to plunger extension with pin . Quick release lock may include a drive ball . In a first position of drive ball shown in quick release lock may be engaged with firing pin adapter . In a second position of drive ball quick release lock may not be engaged with firing pin adapter .

Spring loaded piston may include a notched portion . Firing pin adapter may include an opposing notched portion . Notched portion of spring loaded piston may include a shallow notch and a deep notch . In the first position of drive ball shown in drive ball may be disposed in shallow notch of spring loaded piston and in opposing notched portion of firing pin adapter . In the second position of drive ball drive ball may be disposed in deep notch of spring loaded piston and in opposing notched portion of firing pin adapter .

Plunger extension may include a through bore . Quick release lock may be at least partially disposed in through bore . A quick release lock actuator pin may be at least partially disposed in through bore . Quick release lock actuator pin may be translatable in through bore . Quick release lock actuator pin may be engageable with a head of spring loaded piston of quick release lock . Translation of quick release lock actuator pin may cause quick release lock to disengage from and engage with firing pin adapter .

One or more sensors may sense the position of plunger . Sensors may be connected to a control system not shown of weapon . Plunger may include a projecting portion . Sensor or sensors may sense a position of projecting portion . Sensor may be for example a proximity sensor. Projecting portion may be for example a flexible metal strip.

If firing pin is stuck forward plunger will also be stuck forward. With the breech block closed and locked and prior to firing sensor may not detect projecting portion and the control system may shut down the weapon .

To check if firing pin may be broken solenoid may be activated with the breech block in the closed and unlocked position. When the breech block is closed and unlocked firing pin is in the safety position firing pin cannot move forward . But if the projection portion moves forward and away from sensor then firing pin may be broken.

When the breech block is closed and locked and projecting portion does not move forward upon activation of solenoid then solenoid may be broken. When the breech block is closed and locked and projecting portion moves forward but the round did not detonate and there is no recoil then the round may be out of range of the travel of firing pin or the round may be bad.

Solenoid may be removed and replaced for example by removing mounting screws and depressing quick release actuator pin . Projecting portion may be a flexible metal strip made of for example spring material. Projecting portion may be removed and replaced for example by removing screws . If projecting portion is flexible it may be less likely to be bent from recoil or by an operator maintenance person. Thus a flexible projecting portion may maintain its proper position with regard to sensor or sensors .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
