This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 327 590 tiled Apr. 23 2010 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for publishing and displaying digital materials.

There are several solutions on the market for either publishing digital course materials or displaying digital course materials but no solutions that address both. Tools like Adobe s InDesign are configured to help one create materials for publication electronically while tools like Adobe s Digital Editions VitalSource CourseSmart and BookWorm are designed. to display the publications. These systems are proprietary and require agreements with each entity. Moreover they do not allow an institution to use one system to publish and display content in a relevant way.

One problem that exists with VitalSource and other conventional tools is that users arc often forced to register with a system and create a user name and password. Another problem with conventional tools is the client download issue. Many of the readers display of content require a client download. This means a user has to download and install something in order to use the product. This is replete with issues including how many licenses a user gets.

Currently there is no system in existence that offers an individual or institution the ability to i load publish and display content ii create users from existing databases iii be accessible from any browser and iv employ the electronic publication ePub standard. ePub is a free and open e hook standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum IDPF . In general ePub is designed for reflowable content such that the text display can be optimized for the particular display device.

According to various embodiments of the invention a system is provided for publishing and displaying digital materials. In some embodiments the system comprises an ePub publishing module including a mechanism for publishers to upload ePub files a user management module providing a means to add edit and remove end users from the system a bookshelf module for organizing the user s content in order to create a logical grouping of content and a reading content module for reading content after the user has been mapped to the content.

In some embodiments the system may further comprise i an annotating content module for annotating user selected text ii a downloading center module for downloading content in a specific format to a specific device iii a searching module for searching across content or in a public library for content that matches user selected. search terms iv a sharing module for sharing annotations and comments and or v a virtual content module for creating a virtual content item.

Further embodiments of the invention are directed toward a non transitory computer readable medium having computer executable program code embodied thereon the computer executable program code configured to cause a computing device to provide i an ePub publishing module comprising a mechanism for publishers to upload ePub files ii a user management module providing a means to add edit and remove end users from the system iii a bookshelf module for organizing the user s content in order to create a logical grouping of content and iv a reading content module for reading content after the user has been mapped to the content

In some embodiments the program code may be further configured to cause the computing device to i provide an annotating content module for annotating user selected text ii cause the computing device to provide a downloading center module for downloading content in a specific format to a specific device iii provide a searching module for searching across content or in a public library for content that matches user selected search terms iv provide a sharing module for sharing annotations and comments and v provide a virtual content module for creating a virtual content item.

Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The summary is not intended to limit the scope of the invention which is defined solely by the claims attached hereto.

These figures are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. It should be understood that the invention can be practiced with modification and alteration and that the invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof.

The present invention is directed toward systems and methods for publishing and displaying digital materials for example in a learning environment. The systems and methods set forth herein can include embedded audio video and Adobe Flash interactive applications within the reader experience. This enables the content to be better absorbed by auditory and visual learners than the standard book experience.

In some embodiments the system offers several choices for users to access the learning materials outside of the core reader function. Such choices include i a standard static ePub tile that can be accessed by any of the handheld readers which utilize this format ii a static PDF which can be downloaded so that users can access content without an interact connection as well as a formatted print friendly version and iii MP3 audio files that can be downloaded for users to access the materials as an audio book In further embodiments the system provides a web based reader that allows users to add markup notation to the content through tools for highlighting bookmarking and notation. The markup tools help the user mirror the ability to markup content as they would in a print textbook. Highlights and notes are saved and available for the user to access in a summary section.

Various systems and methods of the invention provide electronic delivery of published content to provide for greater flexibility and portability for the user learning environment based on each individual user s unique needs. Some embodiments provide the ability for consumers to annotate mark up and or organize content electronically in a way that mimics traditional non digital form and practices and provides additional capabilities not available in a traditional non digital form. In addition some embodiments provide an increased ability to aggregate or separate content to maximize relevancy to the context of the delivery. This allows publishers to creatively define unique content by aggregating disparate pieces of content from a variety of sources into a single delivery e.g. virtual books . This also allows for individual pieces of content to be delivered to the customer based on the context of the demand. This further allows for real time dynamic assembly and delivery of relevant content based on the context of the demand.

An additional aspect of the systems and methods for publishing and displaying digital materials set forth herein includes a reduced time to market for published content to availability for delivery. In many cases the time to market can be reduced to such extent that it can meet or nearly meet the definition of real time. Certain embodiments further provide ease of integration into various disparate operating environments and consuming or producing systems.

The above described features can enable publication and delivery of highly relevant content based on a dynamically changing demand context of the consumer system. or person in real or near real time. This in turn can support innovative and creative learning solutions e.g. integrating into an online study hall. In such an example the library may listen in and offer up snippets or full content items to the study hall participants based on a changing context of the study hall conversation. In addition a publisher could be part of the conversation publish content and make it available immediately for integration into this and other conversations.

As set forth above there is currently no system in the market that offers an individual or institution the ability to i load publish and display content ii create users from existing databases iii be accessible from any browser and iv employ the ePub standard. The various embodiments of the invention solve this problem. In addition the systems and methods described herein provide an institution the ability to automatically create user accounts for users within the institution. In some embodiments the system method is fully integrated with a Campus Management module allowing users to be pulled and created from existing data. By way of example when a student is registered in a college associated with the systems and methods set forth herein they are automatically registered with the Campus Management module. As such an opportunity is afforded to seamlessly pull users from the college into the Campus Management module.

Using the system an institution author or publisher can upload content via the ePub standard. The system indexes the material and displays it to one s readers users in a meaningful way with a table of contents. Furthermore the content will be searchable and will offer the user the ability to highlight take notes and make bookmarks. This provides users with a one stop shop for their publication display and user creation needs.

Another problem with conventional tools is the client download issue wherein a user has to download and install something in order to use the product. This is replete with issues including how many licenses a user gets. The systems described herein are browser based and do not require a download accordingly users can access published materials from any computer with a browser and interact connectivity anywhere and at any time.

The systems and methods of the invention use the ePub standard. Consequently they are digital rights management DRM free such that users can interact with the materials in ways they prefer. DRM comprises access control technology that may be employed to impose limitations on the use of digital content and devices. Because the systems and methods of the invention are DRM free users may download and save print and send content to a mobile device like a Kindle or iPhone. By employing the ePub standard it is very easy to repurpose the content for other online uses like mobile applications.

According to various embodiments of the invention the systems and methods may be employed to i publish download print send to a mobile device and manage user database for any publishable item including documents spreadsheets books magazines. etc. ii communicate with any user base iii grow and share collaborative communities iv customize publish and share material with others and v publish digital offerings.

A software application may reside on various components of the system platform the software application comprising computer executable program code storable on a non transitory computer readable medium the computer executable program code configured for performing various functions. In particular the software application includes an electronic publication ePub publishing module comprising a mechanism for publishers to upload ePub files. During the upload process the publisher may also choose to upload supporting content such as audio files video files Portable Document Formats PDFs addendums and content in various other formats. According to some embodiments each ePub file goes through an indexing process to support full text search. The file may then he broken down into a new structure that allows for easy web loading. The publisher can then choose when to publish their content thereby making the content visible in the public bookshelf.

The software application may further comprise a user management module. In some embodiments the user management module can provide three ways to add edit remove end users from the system. First an administrator can manually add edit remove end users using a User Management interface. Second an administrator may configure the platform to use an external user management system. such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP . Third the administrator may elect to integrate through the system s public RESTful APIs .

The software application also comprises a bookshelf module. In operation an end user s first entry point into the system takes them to the bookshelf. By default the end user will have one bookshelf or shelf when initially entering the system. The user can also create more shelves to organize his or her content at any time in order to create a logical grouping of content. When searching for public content an end user will need to perform a check out in order to move content to one of the shelves. Once a check out has been performed the end user can interact with the content in various ways including but not limited to reading content annotating content downloading content printing content and searching within content.

In some embodiments o the invention the software application may further comprise a reading content module. In general an end user can only read content once they have been mapped to the content. Mapping is essentially binding a user to an instance on the content which can be achieved in one of two ways. The first option occurs when a user checks out content to a selected bookshelf. The second option is through a public RESTful API . The mapping process allows the end user to read the content.

The software application may further comprise an annotating content module. When reading the content the end user may choose to annotate the content. There are three different types of annotations i Highlights ii Notes and iii Bookmarks.

An end user can select text and then choose to annotate the selected text. The end user also has the option of selecting an annotation color. Once annotated the end user has a visual clue in the content and in the summary section which provides the user with the capabilities of managing the annotation e.g. removing and editing the annotation .

The software application may further comprise a downloading center module. An end user may choose to download content in a specific forty at to a specific device. The format is generally decided during a publishing process when the publisher uploaded the content. The end user is able to either select one of the publisher s formats the original ePub format or selectable sections from the content n ePub form. Once the format has been selected the end user may select a device for downloading. The system may support various kinds of devices including but not limited to i the end user s PC Amazon Kindle Sony Reader iii iPhone iv iPad and v various other devices.

According to some embodiments the software application further comprises a searching module whereby an end user can perform two types of searches. The first type comprises searching across content or in the public library for content that matches the search terms. The second type comprises searching within a specific content which provides anchor links for the end user to interact with the search results and view them when clicked. Searching can also include related content such as annotations shared content and supporting content.

The software application may further comprise a sharing module whereby an end user can choose to share the annotations and comments he or she made with respect to the content. The end user can also choose sharing properties such as audience permissions and other selected properties. All shared content will become available in the public bookshelf.

In some embodiments the software application may further comprise a virtual content module. The system provides the capability to create a virtual content item. An end user can select parts of different content items into one virtual content item. The virtual content item can then be placed onto an end user s bookshelf for easy access.

According to various embodiments described herein the standards employed may include but are not limited to Open Publication Structure OPS 2.0 v1.0 Open Packaging Format OPF 2.0 v1.0 and OEBPS Container Format OCF 1.0.

The systems described herein include primary instructional digital materials for course reading assignments and activities a browser based reader to display digital content and integration with college systems and student portals. The digital materials may be displayed on a variety of devices including MP3 players and PDAs and may be designed with students and academic outcomes in mind. As discussed below such systems solve several problems and create a number of opportunities.

The systems provide a cost savings to students because the digital instructional materials replace print textbooks published by third parties. Digital materials eliminate costs associated with physical inventory and shipping. The systems of the invention may also avoid the constraints of licensing digital content from third parties. Third parties are typically very concerned about piracy of their digital materials such that they compensate by incorporating digital rights management DRM into their products. DRM usually limits the number of installations and restricts the print function. Also since publishers do not see digital content as a major source of revenue they do not invest much in features and functionality.

In some embodiments of the invention the digital materials are developed on a work for hire basis such that the copyrights are owned by the university engaging the content developers. This allows the university to control the revision cycle so that they no longer have to update materials simply because a third party decides it is time to roll out a new edition. As such the university can correct and revise in its discretion as and when needed or appropriate.

Various embodiments of the invention are based upon an ownership model for digital materials. By contrast most digital content is licensed not owned. According to embodiments where digital content is associated with an ownership model users students pay a one time fee and may use the content any way any time and in as many variations as they wish. The adoption of ePub as the standard for document conversion allows the reflowing of content regardless of device i.e. content will display appropriately on a Kindle an iPAD etc. unlike a static file like .pdf . It also allows the simplification of production output by converting to other formats .pdf rtf as desired by the user.

In some embodiments the system includes essential reading materials chapters and other assets e.g. audio files that cater to specific learning styles. Based on principles of universal design the system may encompass alternative materials or students who have disabilities e.g. visual and neurological impairments. The system may also include a reader that gives students tools to manage their content not only highlight notes and bookmarks but also a way to organize the content by chapter. And unlike current versions of Kindle and other readers the system supports color.
