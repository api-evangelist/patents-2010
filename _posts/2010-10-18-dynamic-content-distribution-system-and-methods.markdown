The present invention relates generally to a dynamic content distribution system and more particularly relates to a dynamic content distribution system that uses a unique Item Response Function IRF method to provide digital content to end users based on psychometric reasoning. More specifically the instant invention gathers psychometric attributes of Registered Users and combines those psychometric attributes with Item Response Function methods to determine how and when digital content is presents to Registered Users.

When users access the Internet they use web browsers such as Microsoft Explorer Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome among others. Usually the first page displayed when the web browser is started is called a home page. Users can designate any website as a home page but typically Internet users use search engine enabled websites for their home page such as MSN.COM AOL.COM and GOOGLE.COM . Typically these types of home pages have dynamic content feeds from several content providers and they feature advertisements from local or national advertisers. In most causes the content that is featured on the home pages changes at some random interval to provide users with a variety of content from a variety of sources.

Entertainment related websites such as MTV.COM BET.COM and EntertainmentWeekly.com display entertainment related content and display some form of advertisement. In over 90 of the websites listed on PC Magazine s Top 100 Websites List most have dynamic content and advertisements from internal and third party sources. Further websites generally provide users with content pertaining to a wide array of subjects and these websites feature some form of advertisement. It is typical to see commercial videos banners sponsored links and advertisements from internet advertising sources like Google Yahoo and Bing etc. featured on websites through out the internet.

Psychometrics is the field of study concerned with the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement which includes the measurement of knowledge abilities attitudes and personality traits. The field is primarily concerned with the construction and validation of measurement instruments such as questionnaires tests and personality assessments. It involves two major research tasks namely i the construction of instruments and procedures for measurement and ii the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement. The instant invention gathers psychometric attributes of Registered Users and combines those psychometric attributes with Item Response Function methods to determine how and when digital content is presents to Registered Users.

It would be desirable for websites to have an automatic content distribution system that use Item Response Functions IRF to measure Registered User s reactions to content that is suggested based on the Registered User s psychometric reasoning abilities.

It would also be desirable for advertisers and content providers to have an automatic content distribution system that use Item Response Functions IRF to measure end user reactions to content that is suggested based on the Registered User s psychometric reasoning abilities.

It would also be desirable for affiliates that endorse content and advertisement to have an automatic content distribution system that use Item Response Functions IRF to measure the end user reactions to the content that is suggested based on the Registered User s psychometric reasoning abilities.

It would be desirable for software application developers to have an automatic content distribution system that use Item Response Functions IRF to measure end user reactions to content that is suggested based on the Registered User s psychometric reasoning abilities.

It would be desirable for end user s to have digital content advertisements and software solutions suggested to them based on their individualized psychometric attributes and reasoning abilities. In addition the system may track the Registered User s attributes and provide feedback.

The present invention addresses these needs by providing a dynamic content distribution system that uses a unique Item Response Function IRF method to provide digital content to end users based on psychometric reasoning.

One embodiment of the present invention is an Internet Web Browser Plug in Application that use Cloud Computing Applications and Item Response Functions IRF to suggest specific content to Internet Users based on their Psychometric Reasoning Abilities. The content is suggested in the following manners. The Registered User completes a registration survey the answers to the survey is scored and the results are stored in the Registered User s profile. The survey scores and other information contained in the Registered User s profile is used to suggest Internet Content that is relevant to the Registered User s psychometric attributes based at least in part on an Alpha Numeric Identification Sequential Score AIS Score or AISS .

During registration of the Plug in Application Registered Users are required to complete a dynamic series of psychometric questions. The answers to the questions are scored using a specially created answer key that use Item Response Functions IRF to identify the Registered User s personality interests aptitude and abilities. After completing the questions before the application is fully rendered the Registered User is provided with personalized content choices that matches the Registered User s psychometric attributes. After the Registered User selects the recommended content the homepage is created and populated with the individualized content and the installation is completed.

The Registered User psychometric attributes are stored in the Registered Users Database and an identification code called an Alpha Numeric Identification Sequential Score AIS Score or AISS is created for each Registered User. The Registered User s AIS Score data is accessed stored and processed by a Relational Database Management System RDBMS . A processing application called the PIRI INTELLIGENT API monitors the Registered User s AIS Score data and the Registered User s actions to the content that is suggested. The PIRI INTELLIGENT API uses an algorithm derived from Item Response Function IRF equation to process the interactions of the User Psychometrical AIS Score with MetaData Elements called MetaDerms s .

A MetaDerm is a specially derived identification code used by the PIRI INTELLIGENT API to suggest content that is relevant to the end users Psychometric Attributes. The System uses two types of MetaDerms. Subscriber Assigned MetaDerms SAM which are dynamic with reciprocal features and Content Assigned MetaDerms CAM which are transient with compensating features.

Registration is required to become a Registered SAM Affiliate also referred to herein as a SAM User and receive a SAM AIS Score. SAM Users are required to complete a registration form that has static series of psychometric questions and additional information about the SAM User s target market attributes. The answers to the questions are scored using a specially created Answer Key Database that is used to identify which Register User s match the types of personalities interests aptitudes and abilities that the Subscriber compliments. After completing the registration a SAM AIS Score is created and the number is registered with the local SAM MetaData Registry and or to a remote MetaData Registry.

Registration is required to receive a CAM AIS Score. CAM Users are required to complete a static series of psychometric questions. The answers to the questions are scored using a specially created Answer Key Database that is used to identify which Register User s match the types of personalities interests aptitudes and abilities that the Content compliments. After completing the registration a CAM AIS Score is created and the number is registered with a local CAM MetaData Registry and or to a remote MetaData Registry.

The PIRI INTELLIGENT API Processes the Personality AIS Score the SAM AIS Score and CAM AIS Score and use the data from of the respecting MetaData Registries to determine how content is displayed to whom the content is displayed what type of content that is displayed when and why particular content is displayed.

Additional embodiment of the present invention which is an automatic Content Distribution System maybe registered and used with third parties such as cloud applications applications made by third parties using the PIRI Intelligent API search engines such as Yahoo Bing and Google and alternative browser in addition to Microsoft Explorer such as Firefox Safari and Google Chrome.

The Web Browser Plug in Application is platform independent and may be installed on any Web Browser Application that allow plug ins. Typically Web Browser Plug in s are programmed using the Application Programming Interface API provided by the developer of the Web Browser. In particular the Plug In Application is programmed to send and receive MetaData information from remote MetaData Registries such as a SAM MetaData Registry or a CAM MetaData Registry . The MetaData Registry stores the definitions of the MetaData that the Web Plug in use to determine how content is displayed to whom the content is displayed what type of content that is displayed when and why particular content is displayed.

The application may be installed on any Computer Enabled Device that access the internet using Internet Browsers these may include Wireless Smart Phones Ultra Mobile Personal Computers UMPC Smart Residential Phones Digital Cable Boxes IPTV Appliances Handheld Devices Personal Notebook Computers Satellite Radio devices Home Automation devices just to name a few.

The following will explain the Methods for creating a Dynamic Content Distribution System for Computer Enabled Devices.

The diagram of is broken into 5 functional groups general Registered User registration see also SAM registration see also CAM registration see also Dynamic Content Server operation see also Relational Database Management System functions presented in conjunction with the usage .

The Registered User is generally represented in conjunction with the computer device . The computer device can be any of type device which provides for data input as further indicated herein including a personal computer PC a Mini PC a mobile computing device a smart phone a networked electronic appliance or a wireless computing device.

During installation of the dynamic content distribution system the Registered User enters the required Registered User profile information such as name date of birth address profession education password etc into the Registered User databases and as shown in . After the Registered User s profile information is entered the Survey Database processes and selects the appropriate personality survey based on the Registered User information provided.

The specific user personality survey s also referred to as the Dynamic Series Survey which is presented to the Registered User is selected from a predetermined group of surveys or a unique survey can be developed using known database scripting and querying techniques. See and for exemplary survey tables and data fields.

As explained further herein a key novelty of the present invention is that the survey s are selected to extract psychometric attributes of the Registered User and further the surveys are selected for use in a unique Item Response Function methodology in conjunction with a distinctive application interface program called a PIRI INTELLIGENT API also referred to as PIRI Suggestive Operators and wherein the PIRI INTELLIGENT API monitors the Registered User s survey responses and continually monitors the Registered User s reactions to content that is suggested to the Registered User.

As and indicate at the time of installation of the dynamic content distribution system on a computer device during Registered User registration the Registered User s are tasked to complete a series of Dynamic Surveys and a Registered User Profile is created within the Registered User Database . The answers to the Dynamic Surveys are used to create the Registered User s AIS Score which indicates information about the Registered User s profile including personality characterizing data. The Registered User Profile and the Registered User s AIS Score for each individual Registered User is then registered in the collective Registered USERS RDMS which is a collection of different dynamic content distribution system Registered Users. Specifically after the psychometric AIS Score is formulated and given to the Registered User the Registered User s registration information and psychometric AIS Score is stored under the individual Registered User s account located in the Registered USERS Relational Database Management System RDMS see . presents an example of an Alpha Numeric Identification Sequential Score AIS Score .

As previously explained each Registered User s psychometric attributes are used to create an AIS Score and a PIRI INTELLIGENT API monitors the Registered User s survey responses via storing the Registered User s current AIS Score and continually monitors the Registered User s reactions to content that is suggested to the Registered User. The content suggested to the Registered User is identified by MetaData Elements called MetaDerm s which are comparable to some of the elements of the tables of data which comprise the Registered User s AIS Score. Further throughout the present invention MetaData Elements are used consistent with the data fields of various databases. See for exemplary database and table structures wherein the various MetaDerm data is comparable among the databases and tables of the present invention.

A MetaDerm is a specially derived identification code used by the PIRI INTELLIGENT API to suggest content that is relevant to the end users Psychometric Attributes. The System uses two types of MetaDerms. Subscriber Assigned MetaDerms SAM which are dynamic with reciprocal features and Content Assigned MetaDerms CAM which are transient with compensating features.

Registration is required to become a Registered SAM Affiliate also referred to herein as a SAM User and receive a SAM AIS Score wherein SAM Affiliates are required complete a registration process similar to the one the Registered User completes during installation or registration of a new user.

As shown in and the SAM Affiliate registration process includes completion of a SAM Registration questionnaire and a Static Survey Series which differs from the Registered User Dynamic Survey Series . The SAM Registration questionnaire and the Static Survey Series contain questions which compose the information that will be stored in a SAM RDMS also referred to herein as a SAM MetaData Registry and exemplary information collected during SAM Registration process is as shown in the data tables of .

After the SAM Affiliate completes the SAM Registration questionnaire aznd the Static Survey and supplies the required information it is stored as Registered SAM Affiliate information in the Registered SAM Database a unique account is created for the SAM Affiliate and a SAM AIS Score is assigned to the SAM Affiliate .

Once the SAM AIS Score is assigned the Registered SAM User information is stored by the Registered SAM RDMS which maintains a database collection of Registered SAM Affiliates and the PIRI Intelligent API is programmed to process the SAM AIS Score . Programming of the PIRI Intelligent API to process the SAM AIS Score includes known methods of creating scripts queries and executable code to perform operations using the data and date fields provided by the SAM AIS Score .

The PIRI INTELLIGENT API also allows the binding of LongBinary LongChar BLob and CLob data as well as the Fetching of LongBinary LongChar BLob and CLob data and enables Multithreading support and canceling queries.

The PIRI INTELLIGENT API uses a C language library to process data and information that the Present Invention relies upon. The PIRI INTELLIGENT API acts as middleware and provides database portability which allows developers and persons skilled in the art to create scripts that processes the data contained in the databases explained in this application using programming languages that is native to Oracle Database Server Microsoft SQL Server Sybase DB2 Informix InterBase Firebird Centura MySQL PostgreSQL ODBC SQLite.

The PIRI INTELLIGENT API contains a library of algorithms that use Item Response Functions to monitor track process and suggest content to users as well as provide content suggestions regarding the specific nature of content that is targeted to users. The programming contained in this explanation can be achieved using the PIRI INTELLIGENT API to process SQL Queries and Statements within each respective Relational Database Management System RDMS .

For the sake of explanation and open connectivity of the Databases the features processes routines functions and sub functions as well as queries statements and other methods and processes are programmed using scripts contained within the PIRI INTELLIGENT API.

A person skilled in the art would be able to use the PIRI INTELLIGENT API to program the unique operations and novel methods of the instant invention using C language to implement database queries. Note while the programming skill required is within the skill of a person of ordinary skill in the art the present invention presents unique operations and novel non obvious methods for dynamic content distribution.

The Dynamic Content Server uses the data sets as shown in and the Content Management System Entity . This data is called tabular data and is mapped to a HTML webpage that is encoded with CSS Containers and Frames. The CSS Containers and Frames receives content feeds from the corresponding UML Class Attributes such as the ones displayed in Entity .

As shown in entities and exchanges content information with entity the Registered User s Content Management System. The Registered SAM RDMS entity uses the content information to determine what type of content should be associated with the Subscriber. The Registered CAM RDMS entity uses the content information as aide for the Content Provider to determine where the content type should be posted. The Dynamic Content Server entity stores information regarding the menu submenu category page and type of content that is displayed. The Dynamic Content Server entity also relies on the users Item Response Functions to suggest content to the Registered User.

The Dynamic Video Server uses the data shown in the Video Management System Entity . This data is called tabular data and is mapped to a HTML webpage that is encoded with a Multimedia Player or the video is embedded in a HTML webpage using CSS Containers and Frames. The Multimedia Player CSS Containers and Frames receives content feeds from the corresponding UML Class Attributes such as the ones displayed in Entity .

As shown in entities and exchanges content information with entity the Registered User s Video Management System. The Registered SAM RDMS entity uses the content information to determine what type of content should be associated with the Subscriber. The Registered CAM RDMS entity uses the video content information as aide for the Content Provider to determine where the content type should be posted. The Dynamic Video Server entity stores information regarding the menu submenu category page and type of content that is displayed. The Dynamic Video Server entity also relies on the users Item Response Functions to suggest content to the Registered User.

In the Dynamic Content Distribution System Software Application of the present invention is installed on the UMPC . The User registers and completes the survey as required by the installation program. The relational database management systems the registers the IRF functions the MetaDerms the User s AIS Score and the Content Management Server all cooperate together to configure and deliver the dynamic content based on the Registered User s attributes.

After this automatic configuration process is complete such as during normal usage when the user logs into the VPN Connection a remote desktop exchange is created between the handheld UMPC and the Television Set that has a Mini Pc attached. When the user starts up the Dynamic Content Distribution System Application on the UMPC the identical application is displayed on the television. As the user moves icons and or select programs during normal usage the information is displayed on the television.
