title: Modular VLF/LF and HF buoyant cable antenna and method
abstract: A buoyant cable antenna system includes an HF antenna section connected to an outboard end of a VLF/LF antenna. With respect to the HF antenna, the VLF/LF appears to be a standard coaxial cable so that the HF antenna can be configured as desired for HF antenna operation. The VLF/LF antenna is comprised of a segment of coaxial cable. The inboard end of the braided outer conductor of the segment of coaxial cable is connected to ground through a capacitor so that the VLF/LF signals are effectively isolated from ground. In this way, VLF/LF currents are induced on the outer braided conductor of the segment of coaxial cable to thereby operate as the VLF/LF antenna.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to buoyant cable antennas and more particularly to a buoyant cable antenna with an antenna module for VLF LF Very Low Frequency Low Frequency bands and another antenna module for HF High Frequency band performance.

The buoyant cable antenna is one of a host of submarine antennas currently in use for communications. The buoyant cable antenna is utilized while the submarine is submerged. The legacy antenna in current use represents a compromise between VLF LF performance and high frequency HF performance. The HF performance is in fact compromised by the need for a single antenna element to provide coverage at the HF and VLF LF bands.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 476 576 issued Oct. 9 1984 to Wheeler et al discloses a VLF communication system which utilizes the electrically conducting portions of an electromechanical cable connected to a deployed aerostat which acts as its tether so as to additionally serve as the VLF antenna.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 760 348 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 774 519 issued Jul. 26 1988 and Sep. 27 1988 respectively to Pease et. al. disclose a towable broadband submarine antenna system for deployment in the ocean operation which comprises an antenna element including a metallic termination tip and a length of single conductor buoyant cable. A broadband amplifier connects to the antenna element and provides separate paths for the VLF LF and the HF VHF signals with amplification provided only to the HF VHF signals. The signal from the broadband amplifier is further transmitted on a coaxial cable.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 252 984 issued Oct. 12 1993 to Dorrie et al discloses an elongated rod of dielectric material for example fiberglass plastic or the like which has a central conductor located coaxially therein. The insulating rod is surrounded by a conductive layer for example conductive lacquer a mesh or braid of conductive material a conductive foil or tube or the like. The bottom terminal of the central conductor will provide a high resistance output for the higher one of the frequency ranges which for example can be a radio telephone or vehicular communication frequency of between 450 470 MHz. The entire antenna is suitable as an AM FM radio telephone combination antenna. Preferably the antenna is covered with a sleeve of insulating material for example a heat shrinkable plastic. The band width of the antenna can be extended by placing a further electrically conductive layer on the rod spaced by a gap a physically and electrically from the conductive layer in the middle of the elongated rod. The further conductive layer is connected to the inner coaxial conductor which in turn can be coupled to an antenna input for example the center conductor of a coaxial cable of a radio apparatus.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 606 329 issued Feb. 25 1997 to Ramotowski et al discloses a submarine buoyant cable antenna having positive buoyancy comprising a communications antenna electronics package encased in a polymer composition the polymer composition comprising from about 80 percent to about 85 percent by weight of a room temperature curable thermosetting polymer having a viscosity before curing in the range of from about 700 to about 900 centipoise and from about 15 percent to about 20 percent by weight of microballoons of a size ranging from about 20 to about 100 microns in diameter the specific gravity of the composition being in the range of from about 0.51 to about 0.65 grams per cubic centimeter to provide the positive buoyancy.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 864 842 issued Mar. 8 2005 to Hung et al discloses a tri band antenna that includes an insulative planar base a low frequency radiating portion a high frequency radiating portion a first ground portion and a signal feeder cable. A resonating lacuna is defined between the first radiating portion and the first ground portion. The signal feeder cable includes an inner core wire and a metal braiding layer respectively soldered onto the connecting point of the low frequency radiating portion and the high frequency radiating portion and the first ground portion.

The above cited prior art does not disclose a modular buoyant cable antenna element suitable for submarine communications which provides the ability to optimize reception of signals in the very low frequency VLF and low frequency LF radio bands from 10 kHz 200 kHz as well as high frequency HF radio bands.

An object of the present invention is to provide an improved multi frequency band capability for a buoyant cable system.

Another possible object of the present invention is to provide a modular antenna in which one section handles the VLF LF portion of the band while the remaining portion can be optimized for HF performance.

An advantage of the present invention is a modular antenna design which allows for a variety of HF or even VHF antenna tips to be utilized while still providing the VLF LF capability that the submarine requires.

Accordingly the present invention provides a buoyant cable antenna system for use by a submerged submarine. The antenna system may in one possible embodiment comprise a coaxial line segment with a center conductor and a braided outer conductor.

The first coaxial line segment has an inboard end closest to the submarine and an outboard end furthest from the submarine. An HF antenna is electrically connected to the outboard end of the coaxial line segment. The braided outer conductor acts as a VLF LF antenna. However the coaxial line segment acts as standard coaxial cable for HF signals. Both the HF antenna and the VLF LF antenna are buoyant to float on the surface of the water when deployed.

A filter is connected to the inboard end of the coaxial line segment. The filter may comprise a first capacitor connected between ground and the braided outer conductor whereby VLF LF signals are induced on the braided outer conductor. In this way the braided outer conductor acts as the VLF LF antenna.

The filter may comprise a second capacitor connected to the inboard end of the center conductor of the coaxial line segment to conduct HF signals. The second capacitor directs an HF signal from the HF antenna to the submarine. The filter may comprise an inductor connected between the first capacitor and the braided outer conductor whereby the inductor directs a VLF LF signal from the VLF LF antenna to the submarine.

The HF signal from the HF antenna may be connected to the outboard end of the center conductor of the coaxial line segment. The outboard end of the braided conductor may be connected directly to ground.

In one embodiment the coaxial line segment may have a length between 50 and 200 feet. Because the coaxial line segment appears as a standard coaxial cable to the HF antenna the HF antenna is selectively changeable independently of the VLF LF antenna.

In another embodiment of the invention a method is provided for making a buoyant cable antenna system. The method may comprise steps such as providing a coaxial line segment with a center conductor and a braided outer conductor. The coaxial line segment has an inboard end closest to the submarine and an outboard end furthest from the submarine.

The invention may comprise electrically connecting an HF antenna to the outboard end of the coaxial line segment and connecting a filter to an inboard end of the coaxial line segment.

The filter may comprise a first capacitor connected between ground and the braided outer conductor whereby VLF LF signals are induced on the braided outer conductor. In this way the braided outer conductor acts as a VLF LF antenna.

In accord with the method the filter may comprise a second capacitor connected to the center conductor of the coaxial line segment. The filter may further comprise an inductor connected between the first capacitor and the braided outer conductor whereby the second capacitor directs an HF signal from the HF antenna to the submarine and the inductor directs a VLF LF signal from the VLF LF antenna to the submarine.

The method may further comprise connecting the second capacitor and the inductor to an antenna feed point and or connecting the HF signal from the HF antenna to an outboard end of the center conductor of the coaxial line segment.

In one possible embodiment the method may further comprise connecting an outboard end of the braided conductor directly to ground. The method may further comprise providing that the coaxial line segment has a length between 50 and 200 feet. The method may further comprise selectively changing a type of the HF antenna independently of the VLF LF antenna.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there is shown an electronic schematic diagram of an embodiment of buoyant cable antenna system in accord with the present invention. It will be noted that connection is made to the inboard side of braided outer conductor of coaxial line segment . As discussed hereinafter braided outer conductor acts as VLF LF antenna in accord with the present invention. The HF antenna and VLF LF antenna are sufficiently buoyant to float on the surface of the water when the submarine is submerged.

Normally unbalanced currents are avoided in antenna system designs. An unbalanced current can occur when an antenna or amplifier or other RF device is connected to an unbalanced transmission line. An example of an unbalanced transmission line is the familiar coaxial line without the use of a balun or some form of surface current suppression such as ferrite beads.

Contrary to standard practice in the prior art the present invention works by making use of unbalanced currents. The unbalanced current consists of a current density flowing on the outer surface of braid on coaxial line segment . Such current is normally considered undesirable since this current can contribute to unwanted signal radiation and interference.

In the present invention an unbalanced surface current is deliberately allowed to form. This is done in order to allow braid on coaxial line segment to act like an antenna. To limit the range of frequencies over which this effect takes place a filter circuit is used. The filter circuit may comprise circuit components such as capacitors C and C as well as inductor L. Other circuit components or combinations of components may be utilized which generally perform the functions described below.

The filter allows coaxial line segment to act like an antenna for the VLF LF bands and as an ordinary piece of coaxial line at HF and higher bands. Signals from the antennas may be amplified using amplifier which may then be connected to the remainder of the buoyant cable which may be in the range of about 1900 feet long.

Capacitor C blocks the flow of VLF LF currents from center conductor of coaxial line segment . Coaxial line segment may comprise the series of coaxial cable RG 384. C forces the VLF LF current onto braid of the coaxial line segment through choke L. This choke is present to prevent the flow of HF and higher frequency currents onto braid forcing such currents to flow through C and down center conductor of coaxial line segment .

Capacitor C floats ground on the inboard side of coaxial line segment and allows the VLF LF current to avoid being shorted out while at the same time providing a low impedance path for current flow to ground for any HF or higher frequency current components that may be induced to flow on braid . Ground on the outboard side of coaxial line segment may be connected directly to braid .

HF antenna shown in the figure is an enhanced buoyant cable element. In another embodiment HF antenna could be a vertical antenna element a spoke wheel antenna element or any other HF or VHF capable antenna. As discussed above the filter circuit just described allows VLF LF antenna to look like an ordinary piece of coaxial line at HF and higher frequencies. Accordingly HF signals on center conductor of HF antenna may be connected through coaxial connector to center conductor of the outboard side of coaxial line segment .

One possible example of a working model of antenna system comprises 110 ft. of RG 384 transmission line to act as VLF LF antenna . In this example of the filter circuit L is chosen to be 3 microhenries C 0.1 microfarads and C 0.01 microfarads. The filter circuit was molded into the jacket of the antenna to protect it from water intrusion.

During testing of this model an enhanced HF antenna was used. As discussed above the present invention allows the HF antenna to be specifically adapted for HF band operation without concern about VLF LF band operation.

In terms of VLF performance a spot measurement was performed using the U.S. Navy broadcast station at Cutler Me. NAA f 24.0 kHz as a beacon. The power received by the invention antenna was compared with that received by a loop antenna mounted nearby. The power received by the loop was 90.5 dBm the power received by the invention was 57.5 dBm. Knowing that the effective height of the loop is 0.79 mm and accounting for the difference in antenna impedances and orientation the measured effective height of the present invention is 31 mm. This represents a substantial improvement over the loop and slightly better than the legacy VLF buoyant cable 20 mm .

Other values of components may be utilized depending on the frequencies types of HF antenna and the like. As well the length for coaxial line segment may vary and may typically be in a range from 50 feet to 200 feet. However the length may also be greater than or less than this range if desired.

Accordingly in one embodiment of operation HF antenna is connected to VLF LF antenna as though connecting to a standard coaxial cable. VLF LF current is induced on braid so that braid on coaxial line segment acts as a VLF LF antenna. The filter components C L and C direct HF signals through center conductor of coaxial line segment and VLF LF signals off of braid of coaxial line segment to feed point of antenna system . In this way the present invention provides essentially independent VLF LF and HF antenna modules for a buoyant cable antenna system.

Many additional changes in the details components steps and organization of the system herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
