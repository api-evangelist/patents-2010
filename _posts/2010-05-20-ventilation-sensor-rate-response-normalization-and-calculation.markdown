title: Ventilation sensor rate response normalization and calculation
abstract: A cardiac rhythm management (CRM) device can extract ventilation information from thoracic impedance or other information, and adjust a delivery rate of the CRM therapy. A tidal volume of a patient is measured and used to adjust a ventilation rate response factor. The measured tidal volume can optionally be adjusted using a ventilation rate dependent adjustment factor. The ventilation rate response factor can also be adjusted using a maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), an age predicted maximum heart rate, a resting heart rate, and a resting ventilation determined for the patient. In various examples, a global ventilation sensor rate response factor (for a population) can be programmed into the CRM device, and automatically tailored to be appropriate for a particular patient.

Implantable medical devices IMDs include devices designed to be implanted into a patient. Some examples of these devices are cardiac function management CFM devices such as implantable pacemakers implantable cardioverter defibrillators ICDs cardiac resynchronization therapy devices CRTs neuromodulation devices or devices that include a combination of such capabilities. Such devices can often be used to treat patients using electrical or other therapy or to aid a physician or caregiver in patient diagnosis through internal monitoring of a patient s condition. The devices can include one or more electrodes in communication with one or more sense amplifiers to monitor electrical heart activity within a patient and often include one or more physiological sensors to monitor one or more other internal patient parameters. Other examples of implantable medical devices include implantable diagnostic devices implantable drug delivery systems or implantable devices with neural stimulation capability some of which can also be used as CFM devices.

This document relates generally to systems devices and methods for normalizing and calculating a minute ventilation rate response factor for a minute ventilation or other ventilation sensor.

Minute Ventilation also referred to as minute volume or MV is a respiratory related parameter that is a measure of the volume of air inhaled and exhaled during a one minute time interval. Minute ventilation can be conceptualized as the product of a patient s ventilation rate and the patient s tidal volume of air inhaled and exhaled during a particular breath. One or both of the patient s ventilation rate or tidal volume can be sensed using an impedance sensor that measures transthoracic impedance which is modulated by the patient s breathing. Minute ventilation correlates well with the patient s metabolic need for an increased heart rate over a range of heart rates.

Typically patients have similar potential heart rate range depending on their age. However ohmic tidal volume measured in patients can differ substantially based on their chest size the positioning of impedance sensors within the body cavity current paths taken within the body cavity etc. Large individuals with large thoracic movements may exhibit greater impedance differences than smaller individuals with smaller impedance differences. However both types of individuals may have the same heart rate range. Additionally deep breaths detected by a thoracic impedance sensor at a lower gain setting could have the same digitized tidal volume output as shallow breaths at a higher gain setting. Variation in tidal volume measurement can lead to inaccurate measurement of minute ventilation which in turn can affect pacing therapy that can be based at least in part on the minute ventilation.

This section is intended to provide an overview of subject matter of the present patent application. It is not intended to provide an exclusive or exhaustive explanation of the invention. The detailed description is included to provide further information about the present patent application.

This document relates generally to systems devices and methods for normalizing a minute ventilation rate response factor for a minute ventilation or other ventilation sensor.

In an example the system can be implantable in a living organism such as in a pectoral or abdominal region of a human patient or elsewhere. In an example one or more portions of the system e.g. device can be disposed external to the human patient. In the illustrated example portions of the lead are disposed in the right ventricle however any other positioning of lead can be used. For example the lead can be positioned in the atrium or elsewhere. In an example the lead can be a commercially available bipolar pacing lead. The system can also include one or more other leads or electrodes e.g. with a lead or leadless such as in addition to lead appropriately disposed such as in or around heart or elsewhere.

In an example the system can include at least four electrodes such as described in Hauck et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 284 136 entitled DUAL INDIFFERENT ELECTRODE PACEMAKER assigned to the assignee of the present patent application the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including its description of an impedance sensing system. The present systems and methods can also include using a different number of electrodes e.g. 2 or 3 electrodes or more than 4 electrodes . In an example a first conductor of the multiconductor lead can electrically couple a first electrode such as a tip electrode e.g. disposed at the apex of the right ventricle of the heart to the device . A second conductor of the multiconductor lead can independently electrically couple a second electrode such as a ring electrode to the device . In an example the device can include a hermetically sealed housing formed from a conductive metal such as titanium. The housing also referred to as a case or can can be substantially covered over its entire surface by a suitable insulator such as silicone rubber except for at a window that forms a third electrode referred to as a case or a can electrode . In an example a header can be mounted on the housing such as for receiving the lead . The header can be formed of an insulative material such as molded plastic. The header can also include at least one receptacle such as for receiving the lead and electrically coupling conductors of the lead to the device . The header can also include a fourth electrode which can be referred to as an indifferent electrode .

In an example measuring tidal volume includes measuring an ohmic tidal volume using an impedance derived ventilation signal. In an example the impedance derived ventilation signal such as a minute ventilation signal can be obtained by measuring transthoracic across the chest or thorax impedance. The measured transthoracic impedance can provide respiratory or ventilation information including how fast and how deeply a patient is breathing. A component of transthoracic impedance varies as the patient inhales and exhales. Ventilation e.g. breathing rate which is also referred to as ventilation rate or VR and breathing volume which is also referred to as tidal volume or TV information is included in the thoracic impedance signal. A ventilation representative impedance difference can be associated with an Ohmic TV. A minute ventilation signal also referred to as minute volume or MV signal can be derived from the impedance signal as illustrated by Equation 1a . MV measures airflow rate e.g. liters per minute Ohmic TV measures volume per breath e.g. liters per breath and VR measures breathing rate e.g. breaths per minute . 1a 

In equation 1a k represents a conversion constant having the units of liters ohm. A larger MV signal indicates a metabolic need for an increased heart rate and a pacing rate can be adjusted accordingly by a cardiac rhythm management device such as the device . We note that if the constant k is not available which typically may be the case then Equation 1b applies where an ohmic minute ventilation or ohmic minute volume having units ohms minute can be related to the ventilation rate and ohmic tidal volume. Typically as will be described later this Ohmic MV can be used to adjust the heart rate. Ohmic MV VR Ohmic TV 1b 

An example of an approach for measuring transthoracic impedance is described in Hauck et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 318 597 entitled RATE ADAPTIVE CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DEVICE CONTROL ALGORITHM USING TRANS THORACIC VENTILATION assigned to the assignee of the present application the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including its description of an approach for measuring and using transthoracic impedance.

In an example the signal processor can extract ventilation information including the MV signal from the impedance signal. Based at least in part on the MV signal the signal processor can output an indicated pacing rate signal at node to the controller . Based on the indicated pacing rate signal at node the controller can adjust the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy such as electrical pacing stimuli to the heart by the therapy circuit . Such pacing stimuli can include for example providing bipolar pacing such as between the tip electrode and the ring electrode providing unipolar pacing such as between the can electrode and either of the tip electrode or the ring electrode or providing pacing stimuli using any other suitable electrode configuration.

The A D converter can receive the output signal of the bandpass filter and can provide a resulting digitized output signal to a high pass filter of the digital signal processing circuit . In an example the A D converter can be implemented as a 12 bit successive approximation type switched capacitor A D converter having an input range of approximately 1 Volt. In one example A D converter provides one 12 bit word corresponding to a sequence of current pulses delivered by exciter . Many different implementations of A D converter can be suitable for use in the present systems and methods. An output signal from A D converter can be received at the highpass filter of the digital signal processing circuit .

In an example the highpass filter can include a single pole infinite impulse response IIR digital filter that can receive a 12 bit digital output signal from the A D converter . The highpass filter can remove frequency components below its highpass cutoff frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz. Many other different examples of the highpass filter may also be suitable for use in the present systems and methods. The highpass filter can advantageously further attenuate baseline dc components of the transthoracic impedance or low frequency shifts such as may result from pulmonary edema or the like and any dc offset voltages created by A D converter . In an example the output of the highpass filter can be provided to an adaptive lowpass filter that attenuates frequency components of the signal that exceed the lowpass cutoff frequency of the adaptive lowpass filter . Attenuated frequencies can include the cardiac stroke signal resulting from changes in blood volume in heart as it contracts during each cardiac cycle which appears as a component of the transthoracic impedance signal. In an example the lowpass cutoff frequency of the filter can be adaptively based on a heart rate of the patient. In an example the lowpass cutoff frequency can be independent of any breathing rate signal obtained from the patient. In an example the adaptive lowpass filter can use a Chebyshev filter. In an example the adaptive lowpass filter can include an Elliptic filter. In an example the adaptive lowpass filter can use a state space structure rather than a conventional direct form structure. The state space structure can further reduce the effects of coefficient quantization and round off noise. An example of such a state space structure is described in Leland B. Jackson Digital Filters and Signal Processing 2ed. pp. 332 340 Kluwer Academic Publishers Boston Mass. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In an example a digital signal processing circuit can be included within the controller such as for example as a sequence of instructions executed by a microprocessor. In an example the digital signal processing circuit can include separately implemented hardware portions dedicated to performing the digital signal processing tasks described herein. An output signal from the highpass filter can be received by the adaptive low pass filter of the digital signal processing circuit . A minute ventilation MV calculation module can receive an output signal from the adaptive lowpass filter and can provide a resulting indicated pacing rate signal at node to the controller .

In an example an MV calculation module can be implemented as a sequence of instructions executed on any suitable microprocessor. Alternatively or in addition the MV calculation module can also be implemented as any other hardware or software configuration capable of calculating an indicated pacing rate based on ventilation information. An example of such a sequence of instructions executed on a microprocessor for calculating minute ventilation indicated rate is described below and illustrated in .

The MV calculation module can receive from the adaptive low pass filter a digital signal representing a time varying transthoracic impedance. In an example the impedance signal can be centered around zero with positive values representing inhalation and negative values representing exhalation. The maximum most positive and the minimum most negative values of the impedance signal can be stored in separate storage registers. After each breath an interrupt can be provided to the microprocessor such as upon each positive going zero crossing.

In an example the signal processor can be configured to determining a moving short term average STA and a concurrent long term average LTA of the ohmic minute ventilation. In an example the STA can include carrying out an average of the ohmic minute ventilation over about 30 seconds. In an example the LTA can include carrying out an average of the ohmic ventilation over about 4 hours to about 5 hours. The STA can represent the present minute ventilation indication of metabolic need. Similarly the LTA can represent approximates the resting state of the patient. In an example the LTA is carried out by an IIR digital filter. Other forms of central tendency or other measures of centrality can be obtained rather than averages or means.

In an example the LTA and STA can be compared such as by subtracting one from the other. The difference can optionally be scaled and can be used to adjust the pacing rate when the STA exceeds LTA. In an example the pacing rate can be adjusted according to equation 2 . SENSOR RATE DELTA 2 

In equation 2 K is a rate response factor that represents an optional scaling coefficient LRL is a programmable lower limit to which the incremental sensor driven rate is added and SENSOR RATE DELTAis the minute ventilation indicated rate at which pacing therapy is to be delivered. In an example SENSOR RATE DELTAcan be a linear function of the difference STA LTA. Also in this example if the value of the short term average STA is less than the value of the long term average LTA then pacing therapy is delivered at the lower rate limit LRL .

In an example more than one scaling coefficient K can be used such as for obtaining a piecewise linear mapping of minute ventilation to the resulting minute ventilation indicated rate. For example when the STA LTA difference exceeds a certain threshold value a smaller scaling coefficient Kcan be used. This reduces the incremental increase in pacing rate for high pacing rates when compared to the incremental increase in pacing rate for pacing rates close to the lower rate limit LRL .

In an example a ratio STA LTA may be used rather than the difference STA LTA used as described above. In such an example the rate can be adjusted according to equation 3 . SENSOR RATE DELTA 3 

In equation 3 STA represents the short term average LTA represents the long term average K is the rate response factor that represents an optional scaling coefficient LRL is a programmable lower rate limit to which the incremental sensor driven rate is added and SENSOR RATE DELTAis the minute ventilation indicated rate at which pacing therapy is delivered. If the value of the short term average STA is less than the value of the long term average LTA pacing therapy can be delivered at the lower rate limit LRL . In an example the LRL used can be about 60 beats per minute. In an example a reduced incremental rate can be obtained for higher pacing rates by using more than one scaling coefficient such as described above.

Other rate modifiers can also be used to obtain a minute ventilation indicated rate. Moreover the minute ventilation indicated rate can be combined blended or otherwise used in conjunction with other rate indicators such as those derived from different sensors providing different indicators of metabolic need e.g. an acceleration sensor indicating a physical exertion level of a subject . Such indicators can have different response characteristics e.g. time lag after onset of exercise that can be advantageously combined with the minute ventilation rate indication described above. Moreover although the above description has been represented in terms of rate between successive heart contractions one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that this is for conceptual convenience and that implementation may instead use the time interval between successive heart contractions or an appropriate combination of heart rate and heart rate interval.

The present inventors have recognized among other things that obtaining the desired pacing rate response to MV can involve tailoring the MV rate response factor Kor K for the particular patient which involves more effort for the physician or other user in programming the cardiac rhythm management device. For a particular patient the measured TV can generally range from about 400 ml to about 4000 ml. The measured TV will generally depend upon the respiration rate breathing rate of the subject. Respiration rate generally varies within a range from about 6 breaths minute to about 70 breaths minute. In general larger people having larger lungs generate larger thoracic impedance differences while breathing as opposed to the smaller thoracic impedance differences generated in people having smaller lungs. This is at least partially why the MV rate response factor must generally be tailored for the particular patient.

However the present inventors have also recognized that can be possible to automatically tailor the MV rate response factor for the particular patient such as based on a TV measurement of the particular patient and on population derived information from other patients.

At resting TV can be measured for the particular patient such as by using a single TV measurement or a central tendency e.g. average median etc. of a plurality of TV measurements e.g. such as over a period that can range from about 2 minutes to several hours . In an example while the average tidal volume is measured over a short time period e.g. 2 minutes a quick calibration is performed by having the patient sit quietly and breathe normally without talking. A much longer calibration period e.g. 6 hours can be used to perform an automatic calibration. During the automatic calibration the patient may carry on normal activities wherein it is presumed that a large portion of the time period will be spent in a resting state so that the average tidal volume thus obtained will reflect the resting tidal volume.

At a normalization factor NF can be selected such as by using the TV measured for the particular patient as an x axis index for selecting a corresponding NF such as by using the graph of to obtain the corresponding y axis value for use as the NF. For example NF can be calculated such as by using equation 4 . Normalizatioin Factor NF intercerpt Slope TV 4 

At the MV rate response factor K can be adjusting using the normalization factor such as by multiplying K by NF to obtain an effective MV rate response factor K which has been automatically tailored to be appropriate for the particular patient. This can be expressed as shown in equation 5 . Effective Rate Response Factor 5 

At rate responsive pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy can be delivered to the particular patient such as by using Kin place of K in Equation 2 or Equation 3 above.

At an ohmic tidal volume TV of a patient can be measured. This can include taking a difference between maximum and minimum values of a thoracic impedance signal held in corresponding storage registers for the patient s previous breath. A larger tidal volume indicates a deeper breath than a smaller tidal volume. A tidal volume measurement can be generated at for individual breaths taken by the patient.

At the measured ohmic tidal volume can be adjusted using a respiration rate dependent adjustment factor to generate an adjusted ohmic tidal volume. For example the respiration rate dependent adjustment factor can be generated by applying an inverse function to that of the non ideality in any non ideal filters used in the signal processing circuit such as to compensate for any non idealities.

At a central tendency of the adjusted ohmic tidal volumes can be computed and used with as the x axis index for obtaining the y axis normalization factor NF.

At a minute ventilation sensor rate response factor K can be adjusted to obtain a K. This adjustment can involve using the normalization factor NF that was obtained using information determined from the central tendency computed at .

At a minute ventilation sensor driven pacing rate can be calculated including applying the adjusted minute ventilation sensor rate response factor to a deviation in a calculated minute ventilation sensor output from a baseline.

In most individuals the minute ventilation during exercise does not meet the pulmonary mechanical limit of MVV but is generally about 25 lower. In terms of the population the peak minute ventilation observed during maximal exercise can range from 0.61 to 1.07 of MVV. The lower limit is reached by individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease COPD while the other extreme 1.07 is reached by well trained athletes.

A cardiovascular limitation can be distinguished from a pulmonary limitation in an example by comparing an individual s peak exercise ventilation and the individual s resting MVV measurement. The patient s ventilatory reserve can be estimated by knowing the disease status e.g. COPD etc. of the patient and the patient s resting MVV. If desired the signal processing circuit can be configured to provide an MV rate response that can substantially match the patient s ventilatory reserve to the patient s heart rate reserve.

At a resting MV of a patient can be measured during a maximal voluntary ventilation MVV such as by requesting the patient to forcibly breath as deeply and rapidly as possible for a prescribed time e.g. 12 to 15 seconds under a physician s supervision. The external programmer can be used to activate MV measurement before the MVV forcible breathing maneuver. The signal processing circuit can calculate the resting minute ventilation by measuring the transthoracic impedance during the MVV maneuver. The external programmer can generate an audible or visual indication indicating that the calibration has been completed so that the patient can discontinue the MVV forcible breathing maneuver.

At a maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation can be computed such as by using the resting minute ventilation measured at . The maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation can be computed using equation 6 . Max Exercise Equivalent Scaling Factor 6 

The minute ventilation observed during the MVV forcible breathing maneuver is multiplied by a scaling factor e.g. 0.75 . In an example the scaling factor can be any specified value within the range including from about 0.67 to about 1.07. In an example the nominal scaling factor that can be used is about 0.8. A scaling factor below the lower limit e.g. below 0.67 can be used for COPD patients.

At a minute ventilation sensor rate response factor can be adjusted using the computed maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation an age predicted maximum heart rate a resting heart rate and the resting minute ventilation. The age predicted maximum heart rate HR can be given by equation 7 220 Age of the patient 7 

For example based on the equation 7 a 50 year old patient can be predicted to have an age predicted maximum heart rate of 170. In an example illustrated in after MV calibration at and computing the maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation at Eq. 6 two points x y and x y can be plotted on the graph. The heart rate is shown on the y axis and ohmic minute ventilation on the x axis. The first point includes an x coordinate x that corresponds to the minute ventilation at rest i.e. after calibration labeled REST in the graph and a y coordinate y that corresponds to the Resting Heart Rate which in a pacemaker patient is the Lower Rate Limit LRL . The second point x y includes an x coordinate x that corresponds to the maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation and a y coordinate y that corresponds to the age predicted maximum heart rate e.g. APHRMAX 220 patient age . The line drawn between x y and x y is the MV rate response factor K.

The MV rate response factor Kdetermined in this fashion will be equivalent in most cases to the earlier Kwhich was derived from population data and which occurs automatically as part of calibration. The MVV derived K3 may be determined prior to the population derived Kis calculated. In either case it will supplant the population derived Kuntil the next MV calibration of the device. Note the MV calibration is good for the life of the device unless there is a lead revision or the user requests another calibration. 

The above description illustrates by way of example but not by way of limitation a particular example of the present devices and methods in which ventilation information can be extracted from a detected transthoracic impedance and the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy can be adjusted based on an indicator derived from the ventilation information. However the present devices and methods can also include extraction of other information e.g. cardiac stroke information from the transthoracic impedance such as for adjusting the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy based on an indicator extracted from such information.
