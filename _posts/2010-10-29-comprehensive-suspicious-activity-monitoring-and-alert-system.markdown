The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61 265 683 entitled Integrated Fraud and Customer Data Network filed Dec. 1 2009 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

In general embodiments of the invention relate to systems methods and computer program products for risk management and more particularly monitoring for suspicious activity across multiple financial institutions and multiple products and channels within the financial institutions to identify suspicious activity potentially associated with identity theft incidents and in some embodiments communicate alerts in the event of identification of a suspicious activity and or a confirmed identity theft incident.

Risk may be defined in a business environment as an event situation or condition that may occur and if it occurs will impact the ability of a business to achieve its desired objectives. Risk management involves 1 defining those events situations or conditions and the potential impact to the business customers and the like 2 the ability to detect those defined events when they occur 3 when detected executing a pre defined set of actions to minimize negative impacts based upon the level of threat and customer impact of mitigation alternatives e.g. risk mitigation prevention and the like and 4 when unable to prevent a risk event from negatively impacting executing a set of actions to recover all or part of the loss. In some cases recovery includes supporting the legal process in criminal prosecution and civil actions.

In the financial world risk management is necessary in various aspects of the business. Financial institutions manage various forms of risk. One such risk is credit risk which is a risk related to the inability of a customer client or other party to meet its repayment or delivery obligations under previously agreed upon terms and conditions. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an advance commitment or investment of funds. Another financial risk is market risk the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements or interest rates. Additional forms of risk are financial crimes including fraud. Fraud involves the use of another person s or company s identity or financial accounts without their permission for the purpose of financial gain. Examples of fraud include identity theft mass compromises phishing account takeover counterfeit debit or credit cards etc. Other financial crimes involve using the financial system to enable or hide criminal activity. These include activities like money laundering terrorist financing financial transactions with countries or companies that are prohibited by law e.g. boycotted sanctioned countries etc. 

Financial institution fraud otherwise referred to as bank fraud is a term used to describe the use of fraudulent means to obtain money assets or other property owned or held by a financial institution and or the financial institution s customers. While the specific elements of a particular banking fraud law vary between jurisdictions the term bank fraud applies to actions that employ a scheme or artifice as opposed to bank robbery or theft. For this reason bank fraud is sometimes considered a white collar crime. Examples of bank fraud include but are not limited to check kiting money laundering payment credit card fraud and ancillary frauds such as identification theft phishing and Internet fraud and the like.

In addition to bank fraud other financial institution business activity may rise to the level of suspicious activity that may be associated with other criminal acts or activities. In this regard the suspicious activity if identified may be instrumental in identifying criminals the location of criminals or other information pertinent to criminal activity such as telephone numbers Internet Protocol IP addresses and the like. These suspicious activities may include but are not limited to bank transactions such as deposits withdrawals loan transactions and the like credit card transactions online banking activity such as compromised online banking IDs and the like electronic commerce activity call center activity and the like. Additionally suspicious activity may be determined from data related to computer security violators i.e. hackers fraudulent telephone calls and entities associated with divisive computer programs e.g. viruses trojans malware and the like and the like.

In many instances financial institutions have difficulty identifying ongoing bank fraud or other nefarious activities until the fraud or crime has escalated to a level that has serious negative financial impact. Further by the time a defrauded financial institution discovers the fraudulent activity the perpetrator has oftentimes moved on to another financial institution. In some instances in addition to moving on to a different financial institution the perpetrator moves on to a different scheme using a different financial product. For example if a particular perpetrator commits checking fraud against a savings bank then the savings bank upon discovering the fraud will likely report the checking fraud to an organization that collects data on checking fraud. However if the same perpetrator later attempts to commit credit card fraud against a credit card institution the credit card institution will be unaware of the perpetrator s previous act of checking fraud.

Risk assessments in the credit realm are undertaken to determine if a customer or a potential customer is credit worthy i.e. if credit should be extended or curtailed. Currently such risk or credit assessments are conducted by credit bureaus. However credit bureaus are limited in the information that they have access to in making such assessments. Specifically credit bureau information is limited to credit related information such as extended credit lines payment history and the like. Absent from the credit bureau determination is other meaningful financial information such as transactional information that assesses a customer s behaviors for example checking transactions credit debit card transactions Automated Teller Machine ATM deposits withdrawals cash advances and the like. Also absent from the credit bureau determination are information regarding the assets the customer has such as deposit and investment account balances and the like. In addition to assessing risk when credit is issued a need exists to assess risks throughout the entire credit lifecycle including but not necessarily limited to credit distribution repayment of credit and the like.

Therefore from a credit risk assessment perspective a need exists to develop a system that is not limited to assessing credit worthiness based solely on credit information and in some instances additional account information. The desired system should provide for assessing a customer s behavior in terms of their transaction data across multiple financial institutions and multiple products within the financial institutions as well as non financial institution information in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of a customer s transaction history as well as historical behaviors in order to accurately assess the customer s current behaviors. From a fraud risk perspective a need exists to monitor and otherwise identify individuals or other entities that are likely to commit fraud across multiple financial products across multiple channels and across multiple financial institutions as well as to identify when customers are being victimized by dishonest individuals or fraud rings.

In general embodiments of the present invention relate to systems methods and computer program products for collecting customers financial data from multiple financial institutions from multiple different communication channels and across multiple financial products services within the financial institutions. The collected data includes transactional level data such as checking transactions ATM transactions and credit debit card transactions that allow for determination of a customer s transactional behaviors. Additionally the financial institution data includes account data such as balances and the like and customer data such as personal data demographics data and the like. In addition customer related data may be collected from non financial institutions such as retailers online and brick mortar government agencies Internet Service Providers ISPs telephone companies Telcos health care industry entities and the like. The non financial information may provide for additional transactional information such as the type of items purchased and the like behavioral data such as purchasing or browsing behaviors and customer data.

For the purposes of this invention a financial institution is defined as any organization in the business of moving investing or lending money dealing in financial instruments or providing financial services. This includes commercial banks thrifts federal and state savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions investment companies insurance companies and the like. A customer is defined as an individual or entity having an account or relationship with entities implementing the risk management system and or an individual or entity having an account or relationship with a financial institution or a non financial institution supplying data to the entity implementing the risk management system of the present invention. A counterparty is defined as other individuals or entities excluding the customer involved in a transaction. A transaction can be monetary in nature e.g. a purchase via a credit card depositing a check in an account a stock trade or the like or non monetary in nature e.g. a telephone call an encounter with a financial institution or non financial institution associate representative an identity authentication process such as a biometric identity authentication process recorded use of a utility such as electricity and the like .

The collected customer data is captured in a comprehensive centralized risk database that allows for analytics and or logic to be performed on the data for the purpose of leveraging the collected data to determine the customer s behaviors and or the customer s likely behaviors to thereby reduce risk.

In addition according to specific embodiments the comprehensive centralized risk database includes negative activity data that identifies the individuals or entities including their demographics transactions products accounts and the like involved in fraud criminal activity defaults and other risky activities that can lead to financial loss. For fraud examples of negative activity data elements include but are not limited to the names of fraud perpetrators information associated with the perpetrators e.g. aliases addresses telephone numbers IP addresses and the like information related to fraudulent and other activity across multiple industry products services identification of activities at the account and transaction level across both industry related activities and non industry related activities and the like. Thus the negative activity data is received from financial institutions and in some embodiments of the invention from non financial institutions.

Further embodiments of the invention leverage the collected data and the negative activity database for use in analytical analysis that provides a holistic view of each customer s financial behavior in order to manage and reduce risk.

In specific embodiments of the invention the collected data is used to determine for customers customer segments counterparties etc. a behavioral baseline score that provides a holistic assessment of the customer s customer segment s counterparty s baseline or normal financial behavior for example how and where a customer customer segment or counterparty normally transacts channels used transaction amounts average deposits maintained and the like. Once a behavioral baseline score has been determined the score s may be communicated to designated parties. In addition once a behavioral baseline score has been determined continuous monitoring of the customer s customer segment s counterparty s collected data provides for determination of deviations from the baseline. Deviations from the baseline can be both positive and negative deviations negative deviations indicating potentially risk inducing behavior and positive deviations indicating potentially risk reducing behaviors. In other embodiments the behavioral baseline score may indicate that the customer customer segment counterparty exhibits risky behavior at their normal level posing a constant or consistent risk such as a credit risk fraud risk or the like even absent a deviation. In such instances notifications and or alerts may be communicated to designated parties based on abnormal deviations from the population baseline.

Embodiments of the present invention provide the collected data as well as the behavioral baseline and risk scores to financial institutions and or non financial institutions as a risk assessment tool that can be used alone or as an input into their own risk management systems. Examples where financial and non financial institutions may use the collected data or the baseline or risk scores include but are not limited to determining whether to authenticate a transaction involving a particular account or customer determining whether to issue credit to a particular customer determining whether to open an account and or determining whether to conduct or expand business with a customer.

Additional embodiments of the invention provide for determining risk patterns and in particular new types of fraud or other new types of risk using the financial institution data the non financial institution data the claims data deviations from customer baselines and the negative file e.g. risk activity and interactions database to identify behaviors and patterns that are associated with loss due to risk. In related embodiments the occurrences of risk patterns are monitored to provide for a health of industry risk indicator such as a risk health score or the like which indicates how well an entity such as a company an industry or a segment of the industry is managing risk.

In addition embodiments of the present invention provide for determining a risk score for customers customer segments customer populations counterparties and the like that is associated with one or more risk types and is based on risk patterns and the combination s severity and frequency of risk patterns in a customer customer segment population or counterparty s behaviors transactions and networks as identified by using financial institution transactional data claims data and asset and liability data. In other embodiments the risk score determination may take into account non financial institution data negative file data and the customer s customer segment s counterparty s network for any known high risk indicators. The risk score serves to predict the likelihood that doing business with a customer segment population or counterparty will result in loss due to risk.

Other embodiments of the invention provide for suspicious activity monitoring that leverages the use of the customer and transactional data across multiple financial institutions multiple products services within the financial institution and multiple financial institution channels. As such the suspicious activity monitoring of the present invention includes account data such as account opening and closing data asset data such as deposits and security investments liability data such as credit outstanding payment status credit limits and the like biometric information and other behavior indicators to detect identity compromise.

Further embodiments of the present invention provide the collected data to data analytics providers such as third party data analytics providers so that the data analytics providers can use the collected data when constructing models that model customers behavior and when developing risk prevention and risk mitigation systems. The third party data analytics providers may develop and or operate the behavioral baseline scoring risk scoring risk pattern and suspicious activity analytic models services. It should be appreciated that a customer can be any individual or business or non business entity.

Also for example embodiments of the present invention authenticate whether an individual is who they say they are. As embodiments of the present invention gather financial transactions demographic retailer computing device identification Telco biometric data in a single location embodiments can provide for executing routines that authenticate an individual s identity whether in person or via phone or online mobile. Accordingly embodiments of the present invention provide a service whereby subscribers can use the service to authenticate individuals identities. The service relies on knowing the customer s behaviors and other identifying characteristics about the customer based on information provided by financial institutions and non financial institutions in combination with information provided by the entity implementing the risk management system such as customer identifying information e.g. social security number taxpayer identification number Global Positioning System GPS biometrics and the like and or customer demographic information.

The apparatus includes a computing platform having a memory and at least one processor that is communication with the memory . The memory stores customer segment counterparty identifying logic routine that is configured to uniquely identify a customer or customers within a customer segment or a counterparty i.e. parties with whom a customer transacts or interacts with from within the data received by the centralized risk database for the purpose of subsequently determining behavioral baseline scoring and and risk scoring and shown in for the customer the customer segment or the counterparty. Counterparty behavioral baseline scoring provides an indication of how the counterparty behaves in certain transactions. An example of a counterparty behavioral baseline score that would be monitored for risk purposes is merchant fraud claim rates. If a merchant s fraud rates increase it may indicate that the merchant has been compromised.

The memory additionally stores behavioral baseline scoring logic routine which is configured to determine customer behavioral baseline scores for a plurality of customers and or segment behavioral baseline scores for a population customer segment which indicates how the segment of customers normally behaves from a behavioral perspective and or counterparty behavioral baseline scores for a counterparty which indicates how the counterparty normally behaves from a behavioral perspective. The customer behavioral baseline score the segment behavioral baseline score and the counterparty behavioral baseline score define the normal behavior for the customer or the segment of customers or counterparty.

In specific embodiments the customer behavior baseline score the segment behavioral baseline score and the counterparty behavioral baseline score are based on financial institution data and or non financial institution data stored in the centralized risk database shown in such as but not limited to individual check transactions debit transactions ACH transactions bill pay transactions or credit card transactions. In addition negative file data and or asset and liability data shown in may be utilized to determine the baseline risk scores and .

It should also be noted that multiple behavioral baseline scores can be determined for a customer multiple segment behavioral baseline scores can be determined for the associated customer segment and or multiple counterparty behavioral baseline scores can be determined for the associated counterparty . This is because behavioral baseline scores are behavioral based meaning that baseline scores are associated with one or more behaviors characteristics traits or the like associated with the customer segment or counterparty. As such multiple customer behavioral baseline scores and or multiple segment behavioral baseline scores and or multiple counterparty behavioral baseline scores aid in better understanding the behavior of the customer or segment. For example a behavioral baseline score may be associated with the locations where the customer or segment interacts transacts and or persons entities that the customer or segment transacts with. A further example includes customer behavioral baseline scores and or segment scores and or counterparty scores associated with customer deposits and or withdrawals. Such deposit associated and or withdrawal associated scores provide insight into changes in income whether the customer is liquidating assets overdrawing across multiple financial institutions and the like.

The behavioral baseline scoring logic routine is further configured to determine positive or negative deviations from the baseline score and provide alerts based on the deviations. According to specific embodiments risk deviations may be configured to be based on a single event transaction or a series of events transactions. Thus a deviation may be defined as a predetermined degree of deviation from the behavioral baseline score or the like. It should also be noted that deviations from the baseline may include negative deviations i.e. deviations that increase risk and positive deviations i.e. deviations that decrease risk .

Further risk evaluating module according to specific embodiments includes risk score logic routine that is configured to determine one or more risk scores for customers segments or populations of customers and or counterparties. The risk score and or segment risk score and or counterparty risk score provides an indication of the likelihood that the customer the segment of customers or the counterparty represents a risk that is likely to result in a financial loss such as likelihood to default perpetrate a fraud in the future be involved in a financial crime like terrorist financing or money laundering and the like. In some embodiments it may also indicate the likelihood that the counterparty customer or segment is susceptible to become a victim of fraud default or other risk in the future. A customer or counterparty may have multiple risk scores e.g. a risk score for fraud a risk score for credit loss a risk score for money laundering an overall risk score and the like . The risk score is based upon risk pattern data which identifies risky behaviors transactions patterns and combinations thereof.

According to specific embodiments the risk scores may be based on risk patterns based off of financial institution data . In alternate embodiments the risk scores may be additionally based on risk patterns based off of non financial institution data . In further embodiments of the invention the risk scores may be based on financial institution negative file data and optionally non financial institution negative file data to incorporate history of risk and any negatives associated with customer data e.g. incorrect telephone number high risk zip code or the like .

The risk score logic routine may be further configured to assign customers or groups of customers to segments based on their risk score. For example according to specific embodiments the risk scores may be based on a scale of one to ten where one is the lowest risk and ten is the highest risk. The risk score logic routine may be configured to assign customers having a risk score between one and three into a low risk segment group. This low risk group s behaviors are not considered high risk nor are they associated with any high risk companies or individuals. There is a low chance that customers in the low risk segment will behave in such a manner such that those doing business with them will lose money due to fraud default or other type of risk. In some embodiments of the invention these customers are assigned a low risk score because their financial behavior is highly predictable rarely deviating from their behavioral baseline score as calculated by the behavioral baseline scoring logic routine .

The risk score logic routine may be further configured to assign customers having a risk score between eight and ten to a high risk group indicating those who do business with these people or entities have an above average risk of losing money in these business transactions. The high risk group may include customers who engage in multiple high risk activities e.g. pay bills late associate with known fraudsters and make large number of cash advances against credit cards to cover overspent costs etc. . The high risk group may also include customers that have committed fraud or defaulted in the past. The high risk group may also include customers who have highly variable behaviors which make one or more behavioral baseline scores unreliable and not predictive.

The risk alert logic routine generates and communicates risk score alerts and or risk deviation alerts to the appropriate financial institution entities non financial institution entities or customers based on a predetermined increase or decrease in risk score a predetermined level of deviation positive or negative and or a specific deviation event or combination of deviation events.

Additionally the risk evaluating module according to some embodiments also includes previously described third party query logic routine . The third party query logic routine is configured to receive deviation queries risk score queries or behavioral baseline score queries from third parties and determine whether behaviors or events exhibited by customers at the third party are deviations from the norm i.e. deviations from the behavioral baseline score or determine the current risk score or behavioral baseline score and based on the determination communicate query responses back to the third party. In other embodiments the third party query logic routine is configured to look at the customer data and and the negative file data and to confirm the customer s personal information and is legitimate. In some embodiments the third party query logic routine also sets up and executes ongoing refreshes of risk scores and behavioral baseline scores on a periodic basis to third parties.

According to some embodiments the risk evaluating module also includes previously described risk pattern analysis logic routine . The risk pattern analysis logic routine monitors the collected data identifies a known risk or a new emerging type of risk and generates risk pattern reports and or prompts risk pattern alerts. The known risk or a new emerging risk type is identified by analyzing behavior transaction data claims data and or the negative file data . In some embodiments of the invention at least one of the following data elements are also included in the detection of new emerging risk patterns product data account data channel data asset and liability data customer data and counterparty data . According to specific embodiments the risk pattern analysis logic routine is configured to generate industry wide reports as well as reports for individual financial institutions or non financial institutions. In addition to pattern reporting risk pattern analysis logic routine may be further configured to prompt generation and communication of risk pattern alerts to designated entities who can then take appropriate action. For example if risk pattern data shows high correlation of fraud activity coming from customers who take out cash advances against credit cards while concurrently overdrawing their checking accounts designated entities may receive an alert report outlining the new risk pattern and in some embodiments the probability of loss and or recoverability associated with this risk pattern.

Further embodiments of the risk evaluating module include previously mentioned risk health logic routine that is configured to determine an industry wide risk health indicator and or risk health indicator for a segment of an industry examples of segments include luxury autos auto industry extended stay hotels lodging industry credit unions in Ohio versus all of the United States financial institutions or the like. The risk health indicator which may be configured as a score or the like provides an indication of how well the industry segment of the industry or customer is managing risk e.g. detecting preventing mitigating recovering etc. .

According to other specific embodiments the risk evaluating module leveraging data from the risk database also includes economic trends analysis logic routine . The economic trends analysis logic routine monitors the collected data identifies trends beyond that of fraud risk which relate to economic health and generates reports.
