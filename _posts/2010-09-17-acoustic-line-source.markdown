The present invention is directed generally towards a system for transmitting acoustic fields underwater and more specifically towards a system for transmitting acoustic fields underwater from a cable towed by a ship or airborne device.

A ship such as a military ship can tow an array of sound receiving hydrophones arranged in a passive towed array. The passive towed array in conjunction with sound receiving and signal processing electronics can detect sounds in the water that may indicate for example the presence of an enemy submarine.

In other arrangements the ship can tow both the passive towed array of sound receiving hydrophones and also a towed acoustic projector which together form a bi static active sonar system. With this arrangement the towed acoustic projector emits sound pulses. Each sound pulse travels through the water striking objects or targets in the water which in turn produces echoes. The echoes are received by the towed array of receiving hydrophones. Therefore an echo indicates the presence of an underwater object and the direction from which the echo came indicates the direction of the underwater object.

In conventional bi static active sonar systems the towed acoustic projector is often deployed and towed separately from the towed array of sound receiving hydrophones. A conventional towed acoustic projector typically includes a sound source mounted within a large rigid tow body. The conventional towed acoustic projector is large and heavy. For example the size can be on the order of forty eight cubic feet and the weight can be on the order of 4000 pounds. The towed acoustic projector of this type is typically used to detect objects in deep water and at long ranges. Therefore the towed acoustic projector is capable of generating sound having a high pressure level i.e. 220 decibels relative to one microPascal at a distance of one meter in order to enable the system to receive echoes from and to detect objects in the deep water at long ranges.

The towed acoustic projector is deployed and recovered over the gunwale of the ship with winch and boom equipment. The large towed acoustic projector which requires deployment over the gunwale of the ship limits covert deployment and recovery. The deployment and recovery of the towed acoustic projector over the gunwale of the ship may also be unwieldy and dangerous during deployment and recovery in high seas.

Conventional bi static active toward array systems are configured such that the acoustic projector is handled with equipment separate from equipment that handles the towed array of receiving hydrophones. Large handling equipment is needed to deploy and recover the towed acoustic projector. The large handling equipment requires a considerable amount of deck space on a ship. The large handling equipment is undesirable not only because of the deck space that it requires but also because it presents a radar target having a larger radar cross section to enemy radar systems.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 683 819 discloses a sonar array system including a receiving array of hydrophones and a transmit array of acoustic projectors disposed on a common axis via a cable. The cable is extended and retrieved by use of a winch. The transmit array has one or more acoustic projectors capable of generating sound and the receive array has one or more hydrophones capable of receiving sound. The one or more acoustic projectors are disposed on a transmit array axis and the one or more hydrophones are disposed on a receive array axis. The receive array axis and the transmit array axis have a common axis therefore forming the contiguous line arrays one for receiving and one for transmitting. The sonar array can be towed to form a horizontal line array having both acoustic projectors and hydrophones. The acoustic projectors and hydrophones can be deployed and recovered using a single winch.

The U.S. Navy used variable depth sonar VDS systems towed behind ships in the 1990s. These VDS systems are large heavy complex systems that required a large handling system with a dedicated room and a stern door. The heavy tow body led to a steep critical angle for the tow cable requiring fairing and a specialized winch with multiple drums. The winch and foundation rating was required to exceed a typical cable breaking strength of 100 000 pound.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a sonar system capable of operation from an unmanned surface vehicle to transmit acoustic fields underwater.

An active sonar system for detecting objects in water includes a transmitter capable of generating and transmitting an acoustic signal having acoustic pressure pulses a cable extending from the transmitter into the water the cable including a hose filled with hydraulic fluid receiving the acoustic pressure pulses from the transmitter a water blocking layer and cable wire and a winch assembly including a winch drum for deploying and retrieving the cable into and out of water. A flattened hydraulic chamber section of the hose is secured within the winch drum with acoustic transducers mounted on either side of the flattened chamber section so that the acoustic transducers act as pistons to generate acoustic pressure onto the hydraulic fluid for generation along a length of the cable.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description drawings and claims.

The acoustic line source transmits acoustic pressure from transducers and amplifiers located on the ship through a steel armored tow cable. Hydraulic fluid in a flexible hydraulic hose integrated into the cable allows it to radiate an acoustic field along its length into the underwater environment.

Off the shelf flexible hydraulic hoses having a inner diameter and a outer diameter rated to 2000 psi pressure can be integrated into the center of a steel armored 1 diameter tow cable. Kevlar reinforced hoses of a similar size are already integrated into such tow cables for high pressure air for use in underwater air guns.

The acoustic transducers on the outside of the flattened chamber generate an acoustic field in the hydraulic fluid . The flattened chamber has an inner cross sectional area approximately equal to that of the cable hose cross section so that no increase in the particle velocity will occur. A greater cross sectional area relative to that of the cable hose would be undesirable because the particle velocity would increase as the area decreases due to conservation of mass. The increased particle velocity would then lead to increased frictional losses.

In a preferred embodiment tonpilz transducers acting as pistons generate acoustic pressure in the hydraulic fluid in the flattened cross section. The hydraulic fluid then transmits the acoustic pressure into and along the entire tow cable . A tonpilz transducer with a 3 diameter can generate 200 dB of source level. This represents approximately 700 Watts of acoustic power. Because of conservation of energy the cable would radiate the same amount of acoustic power minus any losses along its length.

If the wetted cross section of the flattened section had dimensions of 3 by 3 by 0.0164 0.415 mm it would have the same cross sectional area as the hydraulic hose leading to no increase in the acoustic particle velocity. The amplitude of piston vibration would be only 0.1 micron or more than four hundred times less than the smallest dimension of the hollow section.

In a preferred embodiment four tonpilz transducers two on each side in contact with the flattened chamber would increase the source level to 206 dB. In addition the cable length itself leads to a vertical directionality that concentrates the power in the main beam transmitted into the ocean. A 150 meter long vertical tow cable at a frequency of 3 kHz would have a directivity index DI of 28 dB according to equation 1 

Equation 1 assumes a cable transmitting at broadside. This cable will approximate that condition for a CW continuous wave transmission when it establishes a standing wave. A pulsed waveform on the other hand will more closely approximate an end fire beam pattern.

The wavelength c f where the speed of the sound c 1500 m s and the frequency of the sound f 3000 Hz so that the acoustic wavelength is approximately half a meter . The total source level would then be 206 28 234 dB. This very high source level is omni directional in the horizontal direction but concentrated in a narrow vertical beam. There is no other known way to generate this much source level with so little ship impact.

The source level will decrease along the cable for two reasons 1 loss of acoustic energy into the surrounding water and 2 pressure drop due to friction. This provides a practical limit to the length of such a cable.

The acoustic particle velocity of an equivalent plane wave for a 206 dB source is 0.01 m s. Converting this to an effective rms velocity leads to a loss of approximately 0.06 atmospheres or 60 of the incident acoustic pressure over a mile long tube. In other words the end of the cable will have a much lower source level. However the losses over a 150 meter cable will be only about 6 not enough to prevent a standing wave to radiate at broadside.

Conventional active sonar systems have pings of approximately 0.1 second separated by 2 to 5 seconds depending on range . Sending pulses like this would generate end fire like transmissions because the pressure pulse would radiate along the cable as it propagates along its length with a atmosphere amplitude . However the pulse length would be approximately 150 meters so it would be some combination of broadside and end fire.

The CW transmission required to achieve a broadside beam would be appropriate for the continuous transmit sonar systems as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 150 335 and 7 106 656. Such systems require the transmission of acoustic energy whose frequency varies linearly in time in a saw tooth pattern having a 100 duty cycle.
