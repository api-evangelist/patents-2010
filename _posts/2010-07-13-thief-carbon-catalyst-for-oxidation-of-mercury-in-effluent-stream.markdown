This application is a continuation in part of and claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 11 183 221 filed on Jul. 14 2005 and entitled Catalysts for Oxidation of Mercury in Flue Gas now U.S. Pat. No. 7 776 780 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer employee relationship between the Government and the inventors who are U.S. Department of Energy employees at the National Energy Technology Laboratory Pittsburgh Pa.

This invention relates to a catalyst for oxidation of one or more heavy metals from an effluent stream and more specifically this invention relates to a partially combusted coal catalyst for the oxidation of heavy metals such as mercury Hg from high temperature gas streams generated from sources such as coal gasifiers coal fired electrical generating plants ore smelters oil or petroleum residue fired combustors and various waste incinerators.

Certain effluent gas streams contain many toxic pollutants including the heavy metals mercury and cadmium. Coal burning power plants incinerators oil burning boilers and power plants refuse derived fuel power plants and gasification systems especially integrated gasification combined cycle power generation systems are sources of effluent streams with mercury and other heavy metals. The combustion of low rank coals such as Powder River Basin sub bituminous coal and lignites has been shown to form flue gases where the mercury is primarily in the elemental form. Indeed much of the mercury contained in power plant flue gas is in the elemental form. Elemental mercury is a semi noble metal insoluble in water and is not efficiently captured by carbon. As such elemental mercury is difficult to capture while oxidized mercury is more amenable to capture.

Mercury compounds such as mercury II chloride HgCl are highly soluble in water and more readily removed by carbon sorbents. Therefore agents that can oxidize elemental mercury to mercury II chloride or another oxidized mercury compound would be of considerable value in effluent clean up. Such agents would enable mercury to be captured by existing air pollution control devices APCDs present at coal burning power plants. Typical APCDs include wet and dry scrubbers for acid gas removal SOand NO as well as electrostatic precipitators ESPs and baghouse filters for particulate removal.

Ideally the mercury oxidation catalysts would be located upstream of the appropriate APCD. Mercury II chloride is readily removed by the scrubbing solutions employed for acid gas removal and or by adsorption on unburned carbon in fly ash captured by ESPs or baghouse filters. Mercury II chloride is also sequestered by activated carbon sorbents injected upstream of an ESP or baghouse.

Many technologies are being developed for the control of mercury emissions from flue gases. These methods employ sorbents catalysts scrubbing liquors flue gas or coal additives combustion modifications barrier discharges and ultraviolet UV radiation. Efforts have been made to develop catalysts for selectively oxidizing elemental mercury in effluent streams. However these selective catalytic reduction SCR catalysts whose primary role in flue gas is the reduction of nitrogen oxides typically achieve only 50 percent oxidation levels for mercury oxidation. SCR catalysts have not yet been optimized for mercury oxidation and removal.

Due to its relative simplicity and proven successful application for the incinerator market most of the research has focused upon the use of activated carbon sorbents for the adsorption of mercury.

Gold Au and palladium Pd catalysts are used as mercury oxidation catalysts. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 136 281 awarded to Meischen et al. on Oct. 24 2000 discloses a gold catalyst for the oxidation of elemental Hg in effluent gas streams. However both Au and Pd catalysts are not inert and therefore degrade in flue gases.

Thief carbons and their adsorption capabilities are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 521 021 awarded to Pennline et al. on Feb. 18 2003 which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

None of the aforementioned patents discloses catalysts with both high mercury oxidation levels and high adsorption levels for HCl Cl and other halogens or halogen containing compounds. In addition none of the aforementioned patents disclose a catalyst which is self activating and disposable.

One aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention provides a catalyst for the oxidation of heavy metals preferably mercury in an effluent gas stream.

One embodiment of the invention is the use of a Thief carbon or partially combusted coal p.c.c. catalyst for the oxidation of mercury. Another aspect of one embodiment is a longer useful life for the catalyst s which leads to lower long term costs.

One or more embodiments of the present invention comprise a catalyst for the oxidation of elemental mercury wherein the catalyst is partially combusted coal. In one or more embodiments the p.c.c. is treated through direct or indirect exposure to a stream containing a halogen e.g. Cl or Br gas. In another embodiment the p.c.c. is treated with a halogen containing substance including but not limited to aqueous hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid chlorine gas liquid bromine bromine vapor and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment the treated p.c.c. catalyst has a final halogen concentration prior to use between about 0.1 wt. and 10 wt. .

In yet another embodiment the p.c.c. catalyst is between about 20 wt. and 80 wt. ash. In one or more embodiments the surface area of the p.c.c. catalyst is between about 1.0 and 300 m g. In another embodiment the p.c.c. catalyst is effective at oxidizing elemental mercury in a range of temperature between about 37 C. and 400 C.

In one or more embodiments a method is presented for oxidizing elemental mercury in an effluent stream comprising 1 providing an effluent stream comprising elemental mercury and 2 contacting the effluent stream with one or more embodiments of the p.c.c. catalyst described above.

Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a carbon based catalyst with superior mercury oxidation properties. A feature of part of this invention is that Thief carbon or partially combusted coal p.c.c. is used. An advantage of this feature is that the partially combusted coal is easily impregnated with HCl Cl and other halogens and halogen containing compounds. The HCl and Claids in the oxidation of Hg to Hg II which facilitates easy removal of mercury from an effluent stream. Another aspect is that partially combusted coal is much less expensive than activated carbon and is readily disposable. Yet another aspect of one or more embodiments of the invention is that due to the abundance of p.c.c. regeneration of the catalyst is not essential thereby reducing costs related to regeneration efforts.

Yet another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide mercury oxidation catalysts that are easily activated or self activating. For example p.c.c. can be activated via treatment with halogens such as chlorine gas hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid liquid bromine bromine vapor or exposure to a gas stream containing halogens or combinations thereof.

A feature of this invention is that the catalyst is p.c.c. which can be a superior adsorbent of halogens. The adsorption of halogens present in the effluent gas stream enables previously untreated Thief carbon to be an oxidizer of heavy metals such as Cd and Hg. An advantage of this feature is ease of use of the catalyst and thus more cost savings due to the removal of catalyst promotion steps.

Another embodiment of the present invention is a process for oxidizing elemental mercury in an effluent stream using one or more embodiments of the catalyst described above comprising the steps of providing an effluent stream comprising elemental mercury and contacting the effluent stream with the catalyst wherein the catalyst oxidizes at least a portion of the elemental mercury in the effluent stream.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the multiple embodiments of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description tables and appended claims.

The inventors have developed a catalyst for the oxidation of heavy metal contaminants from effluent gas streams. The heavy metals include but are not limited to elemental mercury and cadmium. One or more embodiments of the catalyst are also good sorbents for HCl and Clpresent in effluent gases which aids in the oxidation of mercury. In addition the catalyst can be readily regenerable.

One or more embodiments of the invented catalyst has a high oxidation capability for one or more heavy metal contaminants. For example the catalyst removes cadmium and mercury by oxidizing the Cd and Hg into cadmium II and mercury II moieties respectively.

The active component of one or more embodiments of the invented catalyst is partially combusted coal p.c.c. or Thief Carbon. In one or more embodiments Thief carbon adsorbs HCl chlorine or other halogen compounds present in flue gas thereby serving as a reaction moiety feedstock and reaction surface for the oxidation of entrained elemental Hg. As such the chlorine moieties serve as a means for promoting the Thief Carbons. The promoted Thief Carbons then are enabled to oxidize many heavy metals such as Hg entrained in the effluent. The low cost of Thief carbons make them an attractive oxidation catalyst candidate for Hg in flue gas.

The catalyst can be formed into a solid phase selected from the group of extrudates powders pellets or monoliths to accommodate various reactor configurations including fluidized bed reactors. Alternatively the catalyst can also be deployed on a support substrate such as wire mesh or screen configurations. An exemplary constituent of one such configuration is stainless steel as discussed below.

One or more preferred embodiments of the catalyst can be employed within continuous emission monitor systems CEM . CEM monitors for mercury often utilize methods to oxidize all of the mercury present within a slipstream of flue gas in order to facilitate the capture and detection of mercury.

Surprisingly and unexpectedly the inventors found that partially combusted coal also known as Thief carbon is another suitable reaction catalyst for oxidation of elemental metal from flue gas. Generally the Thief carbons contain between 20 and 80 percent ash by weight.

Thief carbons are produced when coal is withdrawn from a furnace after a brief residence time approximately 0.1 to 2.5 seconds near the burner flame. Suitable Thief carbons are those coal remnants containing carbon in concentrations between those found in raw coal and fly ash completely combusted coal . Preferable ash composition of partially combusted coal i.e. Thief carbon substrate is from of about 20 wt. percent ash to 80 wt. percent ash.

Untreated Thief carbons or HCl treated Thief carbons are employed in a packed bed monolith or introduced via injection into a duct upstream of a wet scrubber ESP or baghouse in order to facilitate the oxidation and subsequent removal of Hg in coal burning power plants.

Untreated Thief carbons have BET surface areas between about 30 m g to 250 m g. Typical particle sizes have diameters which range from of about 35 micrometers m to 45 m. The Thief carbon or partially combusted coal is withdrawn from the furnace after a brief residence time on the order of one second. Thief carbons are inexpensive with an estimated cost of 90 to 250 per ton. The Thief carbon is subsequently treated with halogen which can be accomplished through three methods.

The first is by gas phase contact of the Thief carbon with halogens such as chlorine gas Cl g bromine liquid Br bromine vapor Br and combinations thereof. Further the carbon could be treated simultaneously with both chlorine and bromine. This method of treatment could be accomplished by a combination of the elements halogen containing acids or via the liquid or gaseous compound bromine chloride BrCl .

The second manner of treatment of a Thief carbon is by treatment with halogen containing acids such as hydrochloric acid HCl aq or hydrobromic acid HBr aq . Treatment with halogen containing acids is preferred. One method of treatment with a halogen containing acid entails boiling the Thief carbon in concentrated aqueous HCl 37 wt. percent to dryness. This gives the Thief carbon catalyst an expected halogen concentration Cl of between about 1 wt. percent to 10 wt. percent.

As a third method Thief carbons can be used as catalysts without direct halogen treatment. Instead the carbons are promoted via exposure to the effluent stream inasmuch as the effluent stream typically contains HCl Cl and or other halogen containing species. The Thief carbon adsorbs these halogen compounds due to its high surface area and relatively large pore volumes. Hence the Thief carbons are self promoting carbon catalysts in effluent gas streams entrained with halogens. First the Thief carbon is treated with effluent gas for a time sufficient to adsorb halogen to form a promoted catalyst surface. Second the promoted Thief carbon surface is contacted with the effluent stream for a time sufficient to oxidize the elemental metals contained therein. Third the now contacted carbon surface is renewed via desorption of the oxidized metal moieties.

The Thief carbon catalyst can be used in the temperature range of from about 20 C. 68 F. to 427 C. 800 F. . The preferred temperature range for the Thief carbon catalyst is from about 38 C. 100 F. to 399 C. 750 F. .

The most desirable operating temperature range is from about 60 C. 140 F. to 205 C. 400 F. . This temperature range is that typically encountered upstream of air pollution control devices such as an ESP baghouse filter or wet or dry scrubber present within coal burning power plants.

The inventors have also found that the one or more embodiments of the oxidation catalyst are readily regenerable through the application of heat and or acid. The one step activation is simple and inexpensive allowing for considerable cost savings. The invented catalyst is regenerated in an inert atmosphere such as heating under vacuum under nitrogen atmosphere under argon atmosphere or in an inexpensive oxidizing gas such as air. Concomitant with or subsequent to the metals desorbing from the catalyst the metals are removed from the catalytic process by their collection in solutions for subsequent use or disposal. For example the off gas from heat treatment of the used catalyst contains mercury. This mercury is collected either through absorption into a solution or adsorption onto a sorbent.

Another method for restoring the activity of the used catalyst is by washing it with acid either dilute or concentrated at ambient or near ambient temperatures. Such acids include but are not limited to nitric acid hydrochloric acid aqua regia sulfuric acid and combinations thereof.

The catalyst also may lose effectiveness due to physical build up of fly ash particles whereby the particles block reactive adsorption sites on the surface of the catalyst. Mechanical removal of the fly ash will restore catalyst activity said mechanical removal effected via actual tapping ultrasound treatment or contact of the catalyst with a high velocity reverse flow gas stream. In the last instance the high velocity clean out stream is directed at the catalyst in a direction opposite to the direction the effluent stream flowed upon impingement with the catalyst.

The Thief carbon catalysts are also readily disposable. Spent Thief catalysts can be removed from the flue gas by the plant s particulate collection device PCD or by the installation of a dedicated particulate collection device for the catalyst. The Thief carbon catalyst typically is of powder like consistency with a mean particle diameter of between approximately 30 and 45 microns.

One or more embodiments of the catalyst of the present invention are further described by reference to the following examples.

Flue gas was generated in NETL s 500 lb hr coal combustor which is a pulverized coal wall fired furnace equipped with a water cooled convection section a recuperative air heater spray dryer baghouse and associated ancillary equipment. On line temperature readings flow measurements and four separate banks of continuous gas analyzers O NO CO SOand CO characterize the overall system.

The coal used in this experiment was a mixture of 90 Powder River Basin and 10 eastern bituminous 90 10 . Table 1 gives the approximate flue gas compositions measured downstream of the baghouse for 90 10 coal.

While Table 1 does not include mercury concentrations or speciation it was determined that mercury concentration in the flue gas was typically 5 10 g Nmand 80 to 90 of the mercury was elemental. For some experiments a mercury spiking system was used to increase the elemental mercury concentration entering the packed bed. The use of the spiking system increased the inlet total mercury concentration to as much as 50 g Nm. The mercury concentration and speciation was monitored using a PS Analytical Sir Galahad CEM continuous emission monitor . Inlet total Hg and elemental Hg mercury concentrations were measured by bypassing the packed bed outlet concentrations were measured at the exit of the packed bed reactor. The oxidized mercury concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and elemental mercury concentrations.

An 8 1 l m slip stream of flue gas was extracted downstream of the baghouse and passed through a chiller to remove water. The dehumidified particle free flue gas was then passed through a packed bed of catalyst. The packed bed reactor was constructed of a vertically oriented 0.5 in. outer diameter by 12 in. long quartz tube. The catalyst material was held in place by glass wool packed into the tube. Tests revealed that the packed wool was inert toward mercury. The quartz tube was surrounded by a clam shell furnace and the temperature was held at 280 F. 411 K .

Thief carbon is partially combusted coal drawn from the furnace after a short residence time. Thief carbon or partially combusted coal p.c.c. was treated with a halogen by soaking the partially combusted coal in 37 trace metal grade HCl and drying it on a hot plate to create a p.c.c. HCl catalyst. Table 2 details the experiment conducted with the HCl treated p.c.c.

The p.c.c HCl catalyst oxidized between about 60 75 of the elemental mercury passing through the packed bed reactor. In combination with the low cost of partially combusted coal the effectiveness of this catalyst presents an intriguing option for oxidation of elemental mercury in an effluent gas stream in comparison to other proposed catalysts.

Thief carbon was examined at 280 F. using the same reactor system as in Example 1. A 7.5 liter per minute Wm slipstream of particulate free flue gas generated by NETL s 500 pound per hour lb hr pilot scale combustion facility was fed through the packed bed reactor at a constant temperature of 280 F. 138 C. . The inlet concentration of total gaseous Hg elemental plus oxidized mercury was 10.0 micrograms per normal cubic meter g m with the concentration of elemental Hg being 8.0 g m. After the system had been in operation 6.0 hrs approximately 75 of the elemental Hg passing through was being oxidized as determined by the same Sir Galahad CEM.

Thief carbon catalysts can be used in a packed bed configuration and held in place with an inert physical support. Pure metal or alloy gauzes meshes and wools frits can be employed as the support. Additionally when the size of the catalyst or the pressure drop across the catalyst is a concern the catalyst can be deposited or adhered onto a support material. The configuration can be wools mesh gauzes flakes filters wires monoliths or a combination of these configurations which render suitable catalytic reaction surfaces and are suitable supports for one or more embodiments of the present invention including the Thief carbon oxidation catalysts described above.

Certain stainless and carbon steel surfaces can also catalyze the oxidation of elemental mercury present in flue gases. The chlorides and sulfates found on stainless steel surfaces not only directly oxidize elemental mercury but also provide additional halogen feedstock to Thief carbon sorbents which are supported by stainless steel.
