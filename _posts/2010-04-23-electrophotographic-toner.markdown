In the recent years with the advancement of speeding up of the machines and energy conservation a toner having excellent low temperature fixing ability is required.

However in a toner meeting the needs of speeding up of the machines further improvement in initial rise in triboelectric charging is desired.

The toner for electrophotography of the present invention exhibits an excellent effect that initial rise in triboelectric charging can be improved while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property. In addition since a specified succinic acid derivative is used as a carboxylic acid component in a polyester resin used as a resin binder triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions is even more improved. Also since a reaction product formed between specified aromatic compounds themselves is used in a polyester resin used as a resin binder hot offset resistance is even more improved. In addition a reaction product formed between a specified aromatic compound and a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group is used in a polyester resin used as a resin binder durability is even more improved. Also since a polyester resin is used in a toner for electrophotography obtained by a method including the step of forming particles from raw material components containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions and resistance to background fogging are improved.

A feature of the polyester resin for a toner of the present invention resides in that the resin is obtained using an aromatic compound having a specified basic structure in which a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group are bound to adjacent carbon atoms. There are the following three Embodiments Embodiments A to C .

A polyester resin for a toner obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component wherein the carboxylic acid component and or the alcohol component contains an aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia 

wherein Ris a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group and Xis a hydrogen atom an aldehyde group an allyl group a vinyl group a methoxy group or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.

a reaction product reaction product i of one or more aromatic compounds themselves represented by the formula Ib 

wherein Ris a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group and Xis a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group and

a reaction product reaction product ii obtained by reacting an aromatic compound represented by the formula Ic 

wherein Ris a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group and Xis an unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may have a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group and a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group 

The polyester resin for a toner of the present invention has excellent initial rise in triboelectric charging while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner. Though the details of the reasons therefor are unclear it is presumably as described below. Since the aromatic compound used in the present invention has an aromatic ring in a case where the compound is used as a monomer for a polyester a glass transition temperature can be increased while having a low softening point. Besides as compared with conventional phthalic acid and isophthalic acid since a methoxy group having an electron donating property is bound an aromatic ring at a position adjacent to a hydroxyl group a monomer having a phenolic hydroxyl group has a higher pKa isoelectric point so that electrons are stored in the aromatic ring thereby increasing electron density in the aromatic ring whereby consequently initial rise in triboelectric charging is improved. The number of the methoxy groups on the carbon atom positioned adjacent to the carbon atom to which a hydroxyl group is bound may be at least one to improve initial rise in triboelectric charging of the toner or the number may be two.

A major feature of Embodiment A resides in that the resin is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component wherein the carboxylic acid component and or the alcohol component contains an aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia 

wherein Ris a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group and Xis a hydrogen atom an aldehyde group an allyl group a vinyl group a methoxy group or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.

In X the linking group that the hydroxyl group or carboxyl group may have is preferably a divalent hydrocarbon group having an unsaturated bond and desirably a divalent hydrocarbon group having preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms and more preferably 2 or 3 carbon atoms. In a case of without having a linking group Xwould be a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl group. Specific examples of more preferred Xinclude a group represented by CH CH COOH or CH CH CHOH. Here the carboxyl group may be an alkyl 1 to 3 carbon atoms ester provided that when Xis a carboxyl group namely a carboxyl group without a linking group Rpreferably is a methoxy group.

As preferable combinations of Rand X in a case where Ris a hydrogen atom it is preferable that Xis an aldehyde group an allyl group a vinyl group a methoxy group or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group. In a case where Ris a hydroxyl group it is preferable that Xis a methoxy group or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group. Also in a case where Ris a methoxy group it is preferable that Xis a hydrogen atom an aldehyde group or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.

The aromatic compound has a molecular weight of preferably 1 000 or less more preferably 800 or less even more preferably 400 or less and still even more preferably 300 or less from the viewpoint of reactivity in the polycondensation. In addition the lower limit is 124 which is the case where both of Rand Xare hydrogen atoms.

The aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia acts as any component of the carboxylic acid component and the alcohol component during the polycondensation depending on the kinds of the functional group as a raw material monomer for a polyester. A hydroxycarboxylic acid is polycondensed mainly as a carboxylic acid component therefore in the present invention for the sake of convenience in a case where the aromatic compound is a hydroxycarboxylic acid in which Xhas a carboxyl group the aromatic compound is regarded as a carboxylic acid component and in a case where the aromatic compound is an alcohol in which Xhas no carboxyl groups the aromatic compound is regarded as an alcohol component to be used in the calculation of the content or the molar ratio. In general the reactivity of a hydroxyl group bound directly to an aromatic ring is low. The aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia is considered to have an increased reactivity because a methoxy group is bound to a carbon atom positioned adjacent to the carbon atom to which a hydroxyl group is bound.

In the aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia an aromatic compound to be used as the carboxylic acid component is preferably at least one hydroxycarboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of ferulic acid X CH CH COOH R hydrogen atom 5 hydroxyferulic acid X CH CH COOH R hydroxyl group sinapic acid X CH CH COOH methoxy group vanillic acid X COOH R H and syringic acid X COOH methoxy group and more preferably at least one hydroxycarboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of ferulic acid 5 hydroxyferulic acid sinapic acid and syringic acid from the viewpoint of initial rise in triboelectric charging triboelectric stability and resistance to background fogging of the toner.

 1 introducing an aqueous medium to a mixed solution prepared by dissolving or dispersing raw materials containing a resin binder in an organic solvent and thereafter removing the organic solvent from the mixture to provide an aqueous dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder and 2 aggregating or unifying the primary particles is preferred. Here another specific example of the method A is a method including the steps of 1 forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant and 2 aggregating or unifying the primary particles. A specific method of the method B includes a method including the steps of subjecting a radical polymerizable monomer solution in which a resin binder is dissolved to an emulsion polymerization to give fine resin particles and fusing the resulting fine resin particles in an aqueous medium see JP A 2001 42568 .

The aqueous medium is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 1 000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the organic solvent.

In the step 1 a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin and a nonionic surfactant are mixed whereby a dispersion can also be prepared without using an organic solvent. In this step a viscosity of the mixture is lowered so that a resin binder can be formed into fine particles. This is due to the fact that a nonionic surfactant is compatible to a resin binder and a viscosity of the mixture is lowered which results in an apparent lowering of a softening point of the resin. Utilizing this phenomenon an apparent softening point of a resin binder that is compatible with a nonionic surfactant can be lowered to a temperature of a boiling point of water or lower so that a dispersion prepared by dispersing a resin binder can be obtained by adding water dropwise under a normal pressure even with a resin binder having a melting point or softening point of 100 C. or more for the resin alone. In this method at least water and a nonionic surfactant would be needed so that the method can be applied to a resin insoluble to an organic solvent and that loads on the facilities for collecting an organic solvent and maintaining operating environments are unnecessary and a specialized apparatus that is to be needed when utilizing a mechanical means is also unnecessary thereby having an advantage that a resin dispersion can be produced economically.

The nonionic surfactant usable in the step 1 includes for example polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers or polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate polyoxyethylene fatty esters such as polyethylene glycol monolaurate polyethylene glycol monostearate polyethylene glycol monooleate oxyethylene oxypropylene block copolymers and the like. In addition the nonionic surfactant may be used together with an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant.

It is preferable to select a nonionic surfactant which has excellent compatibility with a resin binder. In order to obtain a stable dispersion of a resin binder the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of preferably from 12 to 20 and it is more preferable to use two or more members of nonionic surfactants having different HLB depending on the members of the resin binders. For example in a case where a resin has a high hydrophilicity at least one member of a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of from 12 to 18 may be used. In a case of a resin having high hydrophobicity it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant having a low HLB for example one having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so and a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB for example one having an HLB of 14 to 20 are used together thereby adjusting a weighted average of HLB of both the nonionic surfactants to 12 to 20. In this case it is presumed that primarily a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so can be made compatible with the resin and that a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB can serve to stabilize the dispersion of the resin in water.

In addition in a case where a colorant is used it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant is adsorbed to the colorant. By adjusting the HLB of the nonionic surfactant to the range mentioned above the nonionic surfactant is likely to adsorb to the surface of the colorant whereby the nonionic surfactant can be stably present in the resin binder.

When a resin binder is formed into fine particles in water under a normal pressure the nonionic surfactant has a cloud point of preferably from 70 to 105 C. and more preferably from 80 to 105 C.

The nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 5 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of lowering a melting point of the resin binder and the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 80 parts by weight or less from the viewpoint of controlling the nonionic surfactant remaining in the toner. Therefore the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably from 5 to 80 parts by weight more preferably from 10 to 70 parts by weight and even more preferably from 20 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of satisfying both of these.

In the step 1 upon the formation of primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant it is desirable that the temperature inside the system is kept within a temperature calculated from a cloud point of the nonionic surfactant plus or minus 10 C. preferably plus or minus 8 C. more preferably plus or minus 5 C. from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the nonionic surfactant and prevention of the lowering of dispersion efficiency.

In the step 1 for example it is preferable that an aqueous medium preferably deionized water or distilled water is added dropwise to a system in a state where a mixture of a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is stirred and homogeneously mixed. In a case where a colorant is used it is preferable that a resin binder containing a colorant being made compatible with a nonionic surfactant does not separate from water.

The aqueous medium in the step 1 is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 3 000 parts by weight more preferably from 400 to 3 000 parts by weight and even more preferably from 800 to 3 000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of obtaining homogeneous aggregated particles in the subsequent steps.

The particle size of the primary particles containing a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin can be controlled by an amount of the nonionic surfactant an extent of stirring a rate of adding water or the like. In the step 1 the rate of adding an aqueous medium to a mixture containing at least a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is preferably from 0.1 to 50 g min more preferably from 0.5 to 40 g min and even more preferably from 1 to 30 g min per 100 g of the mixture from the viewpoint of obtaining homogenous primary particles.

In a case where a resin binder has an acidic group such as a carboxyl group or a sulfonate group water may be added after a part or all of the resin binder is neutralized or while neutralizing. In a case where a resin binder having an acidic group is used in addition to the factors of the nonionic surfactant self emulsifiability would be a controlling factor for the particle size of the primary particles.

A dispersant can be used for the purposes of lowering a melt viscosity and a melting point of the resin binder and improving dispersibility of the formed primary particles. The dispersant includes for example water soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol methyl cellulose ethyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose sodium polyacrylate and sodium polymethacrylate anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sodium octadecyl sulfate sodium oleate sodium laurate and potassium stearate cationic surfactants such as laurylamine acetate stearylamine acetate and lauryl trimethylammonium chloride amphoteric surfactants such as lauryl dimethylamine oxide and inorganic salts such as tricalcium phosphate aluminum hydroxide calcium sulfate calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. The dispersant is used in an amount of preferably 20 parts by weight or less more preferably 15 parts by weight or less and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of emulsion stability and detergency.

The solid content of the dispersion of the primary particles containing a resin binder obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 hereinafter also simply referred to as primary particles is preferably from 7 to 50 by weight and more preferably from 7 to 40 by weight from the viewpoint of stability of the dispersion and handling property of the dispersion in the aggregating step. The solid content includes non volatile components such as a resin and a nonionic surfactant.

The primary particles have an average particle size of preferably from 0.05 to 3 m more preferably from 0.05 to 1 and even more preferably from 0.05 to 0.8 m from the viewpoint of homogeneously aggregating the primary particles in the subsequent steps. In the present invention the average particle size of the primary particles refers to a volume median particle size D which can be measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer or the like.

Subsequently the step of aggregating and unifying the primary particles obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 step 2 will be explained.

In the step 2 the solid content of the system in the aggregating step of aggregating the primary particles obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 can be adjusted by adding water to a dispersion of a resin binder and the solid content is preferably from 5 to 50 by weight more preferably from 5 to 30 by weight and even more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight in order to cause homogeneous aggregation.

The pH inside the system in the aggregating step is preferably from 2 to 10 more preferably from 2 to 9 and even more preferably from 3 to 8 from the viewpoint of satisfying both dispersion stability of a mixed solution and aggregating property of the fine particles made of a resin binder or the like.

It is preferable that the temperature inside the system in the aggregating step is a temperature equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from a softening point of a resin binder minus 70 C. or more and equal to or lower than a softening point from the same viewpoint.

In addition an additive such as a colorant or a charge control agent may be previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles or each additive may be separately dispersed in a dispersion medium such as water to prepare a dispersion and the dispersion is mixed with primary particles and subjected to the aggregating step. In a case where an additive is previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles it is preferable that the resin binder and the additive are previously melt kneaded. In the melt kneading it is preferable to use an open roller type twin screw kneader. The open roller twin screw kneader is a kneader containing two rollers arranged in parallel closely to each other wherein a heating function or a cooling function can be provided by passing a heating medium through each roller. Therefore the open roller type twin screw kneader contains a melt kneading part that is open and also is equipped with a heat roller and a cooling roller so that the open roller type twin screw kneader can easily dissipate the kneading heat generated during the melt kneading which is different from twin screw extruders conventionally used.

In the aggregating step in order to effectively carry out the aggregation an aggregating agent can be added. As the aggregating agent a cationic surfactant in the form of a quaternary salt polyethyleneimine or the like may be used as an organic aggregating agent and an inorganic metal salt a divalent or higher polyvalent metal complex or the like may be used as an inorganic aggregating agent. The inorganic metal salt includes for example metal salts such as sodium sulfate sodium chloride calcium chloride calcium nitrate barium chloride magnesium chloride zinc chloride aluminum chloride and aluminum sulfate and inorganic metal salt polymers such as poly aluminum chloride poly aluminum hydroxide and poly calcium sulfide .

The amount of the aggregating agent used is preferably 30 parts by weight or less more preferably 20 parts by weight or less and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of the environmental resistance of the toner.

Subsequently the aggregated particles containing at least a resin binder obtained in the above mentioned aggregating step are heated to unify unifying step .

The temperature inside the system in the unifying step is preferably equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder minus 50 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10 C. more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 45 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point plus 10 C. and even more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 40 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10 C. from the viewpoint of controlling particle sizes particle size distribution and shapes of the intended toner and fusibility of the aggregate particles. In addition it is preferable that the stirring rate is a rate at which the aggregate particles are not precipitated. In the present invention in a case where two or more kinds of resins are mixed and used as a resin binder a weighted average of softening points of mixed resins is regarded as a softening point of the resin binder.

The unified particles obtained in the step 2 are subjected through the steps such as liquid solid separation step such as filtration washing step and drying step whereby a toner can be obtained.

In the washing step it is preferable that an acid is used for removing metal ions on the toner surface in order to secure satisfactory triboelectric charging properties and reliability as a toner. Also it is preferable that the added nonionic surfactant is completely removed by washing and it is preferable that the washing is carried out with an aqueous solution at a temperature equal to or lower than the cloud point of the nonionic surfactant. The washing is carried out preferably plural times.

In addition in the drying step any methods such as vibration type fluidizing drying method spray drying method freeze drying method or flash jet method can be employed.

The toner of the present invention has a volume median particle size D preferably from 3 to 15 m and more preferably from 3 to 10 m irrespective of the production methods. Here the volume median particle size D as used herein means a particle size at 50 counting from smaller particle sizes in a cumulative volume frequency calculated in volume percentage.

In the toner of the present invention it is preferable that fine inorganic particles are used as an external additive for improving transferablility. Specific examples preferably include one or more members selected from the group consisting of silica alumina titania zirconia tin oxide and zinc oxide. Among them silica is preferred and it is more preferable to contain a silica having a small specific gravity from the viewpoint of preventing embedment.

The silica is preferably a hydrophobic silica that is hydrophobically treated from the viewpoint of transferability of the toner.

It is preferable that the method of subjecting silica to a hydrophobic treatment includes the step of modifying of a silanol group on the surface of the silica particles with a hydrophobic group such as an alkylsilyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms for example a methylsilyl group a hexylsilyl group or the like or coating the surface with a hydrophobic resin.

The hydrophobically treating agent for hydrophobically treating the surface of silica particles is exemplified by organochlorosilane organoalkoxysilane organodisilazane cyclic organopolysilazane linear organopolysiloxane and the like and specifically include hexamethyldisilazane HMDS dimethyldichlorosilane DMDS a silicone oil octyltriethoxysilane OTES methyltriethoxysilane and the like. Among them hexamethyldisilazane is preferred.

A method of substituting a silanol group on the surface of silica particles with a hydrophobic group such as an alkylsilyl group includes for example a method of reacting a water dispersed silica colloid with an alkali metal salt of an alkylsilanol see JP B Hei 7 33250 or the like a method of adding an organic solvent a cationic surfactant and an alkyltrialkoxysilane to a water dispersed silica colloid thereafter subjecting the mixture to an azeotropic dehydration and then further heating the residue under reflux see JP A Hei 6 73389 a method of treating a wet silica or dry silica with an alkyltrialkoxysilane an organohalogenated silicon compound or the like see JP A Hei 6 206720 JP A Hei 7 187647 or the like and the like.

In the silica that is hydrophobically treated at least a part of silanol groups on the surface of silica particles of which is substituted with a hydrophobic group it is desirable that the silanol groups on the surface of silica particles are substituted with hydrophobic groups in a ratio of preferably 5 by mol or more more preferably 10 by mol or more and even more preferably 20 by mol or more.

Here since the silanol group on the surface of silica particles is capable of ionically adsorbing an amino group or imino group the percentage of the silanol groups modified by the above mentioned hydrophobic groups can be known by for example measuring amounts of di n butylamine adsorbed to the silica before and after the modification reaction respectively. It is preferable that the treatment amount of the hydrophobically treating agent is from 1 to 7 mg mper surface area of the silica.

The external additive has an average particle size of preferably from 10 to 250 nm more preferably from 10 to 200 nm and even more preferably from 15 to 90 nm from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability flowability and transferability of the toner.
