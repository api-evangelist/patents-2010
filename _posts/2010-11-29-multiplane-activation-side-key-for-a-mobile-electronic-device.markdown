Mobile electronic devices such as mobile telephones smartphones MP3 music players personal digital assistants PDAs compact gaming machines and laptop computers are becoming increasingly more popular. There is pressure to make these devices more compact. As well display screens often take up a large proportion of a top surface of the devices. As a result there is less room for input mechanisms such as function keys.

The small size of most mobile electronic devices also makes it difficult for some users with physical disabilities to operate function keys located on sides of the device especially if the device lying flat on a surface.

Aspects of the present disclosure provide an input mechanism such as a function key on an edge of a mobile electronic device that is actuatable from two or more directions. In some embodiments the function key is actuatable from two or more planar directions. In some embodiments each direction of actuation is associated with a different function. By adding another planar directional force to a key the limited space available on a mobile electronic device is efficiently used. In other embodiments the same function can be activated by actuating the input mechanism in more than one direction. It is sometimes difficult to access a function key on the side of a mobile electronic device when the device is lying flat on a surface and therefore it may be beneficial to be able to actuate the same key from the front of the device for example.

In one aspect there is provided an input mechanism for a mobile electronic device the input mechanism comprising a cap shaped to wrap around an edge of the mobile electronic device and moveable in a first direction and a second direction and a first switch for activating a first function on the mobile electronic device the first switch being covered by the cap and actuatable upon movement of the cap in the first direction toward the first switch a second switch for activating a second function on the mobile electronic device the second switch being covered by the cap and actuatable upon movement of the cap in the second direction toward the second switch.

In another aspect there is provided a mobile electronic device comprising an input mechanism including a cap shaped to wrap around an edge of the mobile electronic device and moveable in a first direction and a second direction and a first switch for activating a first function on the mobile electronic device the first switch being covered by the cap and actuatable upon movement of the cap in the first direction toward the first switch and a second switch for activating a second function on the mobile electronic device the second switch being covered by the cap and actuatable upon movement of the cap in the second direction toward the second switch a processor for implementing the first function upon actuation of the first switch and the second function upon actuation of the second switch and a circuit connecting the input mechanism to the processor.

Referring to an exemplary mobile electronic device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure has an input mechanism with a cap on an edge. The cap is moveable in at least two directions A and B. Moving the cap in either direction actuates one of at least two switches which in turn activates a function on the mobile electronic device .

Reference is now made to which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the mobile electronic device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile electronic device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile electronic device in various embodiments the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile electronic device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile electronic device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as .

The mobile electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of a wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile electronic device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile electronic device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile electronic device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile electronic device .

The mobile electronic device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode.

For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .
