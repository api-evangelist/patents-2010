This invention is an extension of Applicants prior invention disclosed in the above referenced patent applications relating to novel anti IL 6 antibodies and novel therapies and therapeutic protocols using anti IL 6 antibodies preferably those described herein. In particular this invention pertains to methods of preventing or treating thrombosis in a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient an IL 6 antagonist e.g. an anti IL 6 antibody as disclosed in applicants earlier applications referenced herein whereby the patient s coagulation profile is improved.

In another embodiment the invention provides novel combination therapies wherein thrombosis is prevented or treated by the administration of at least one IL 6 antagonist and at least one other therapeutic compound e.g. a statin compound including but not limited to atorvastatin cerivastatin fluvastatin lovastatin mevastatin pitavastatin pravastatin rosuvastatin simvastatin or any combination thereof.

In another embodiment this invention relates to methods of preventing or treating thrombosis in a patient in a state of hypercoagulation or in a state that renders the patient more susceptible to hypercoagulation or thrombosis comprising administering to the patient an anti IL 6 antibody or antibody fragment whereby the patient s coagulation profile is improved or restored to a normal condition and monitoring the patient to assess coagulation profile wherein the anti IL 6 antibody or antibody fragment specifically binds to the same linear or conformational epitope s and or competes for binding to the same linear or conformational epitope s on an intact human IL 6 polypeptide or fragment thereof as an anti IL 6 antibody comprising Ab1 Ab2 Ab3 Ab4 Ab5 Ab6 Ab7 Ab8 Ab9 Ab10 Ab11 Ab12 Ab13 Ab14 Ab15 Ab16 Ab17 Ab18 Ab19 Ab20 Ab21 Ab22 Ab23 Ab24 Ab25 Ab26 Ab27 Ab28 Ab29 Ab30 Ab31 Ab32 Ab33 Ab34 Ab35 or Ab36 and chimeric human humanized antibodies or antibody fragments containing most or all of the CDRs of the afore identified antibodies. Preferably these antibodies are aglycosylated.

This invention further pertains to novel methods of preventing or treating thrombosis in a patient in need thereof using anti IL 6 antibodies preferably humanized antibodies possessing an elimination half life which is at least about 25 days.

Thrombosis is a significant cause of mortality in cancer patients. Bick N Engl Med 349 109 111 2003 . For example serious life threatening thrombotic events occur in approximately 6 of lung cancer patients. Alguire et al. J Clin Oncol 2004 Vol 22 July 15 Supplement No. 14S 8082. Cancer patients often exhibit hypercoagulation in which the coagulation system has an increased clotting tendency. Rickles and Edwards Blood 62 14 31 1983 . Markers of hypercoagulation correlate with poor patient outcome for at least some cancers. Bick Semin Thromb Hemostat 18 353 372 1992 Buccheri et al. Cancer 97 3044 3052 2003 Wojtukiewicz Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 3 429 437 1992 . Causes of hypercoagulation include the cancer itself and the cancer treatments e.g. chemotherapy . Hypercoagulation results in an increased risk of thrombotic events which can be further exacerbated when patients become bed ridden. When not contraindicated anticoagulant therapy has conferred survival benefit in some cancers. Lebeau et al. Cancer 74 38 45 1994 Chahinian et al. J Clin Oncol 7 993 1002 1989 . However therapeutic options are often limited because many cancer patients are at an elevated risk of major bleeding precluding administration of anticoagulants that could otherwise be given prophylactically to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In summary the available methods for prevention of thrombosis in cancer patients are unsatisfactory and thus there is a need for new therapies. Such therapies would enhance cancer patient survival and promote better quality of life.

Thrombosis can also be a significant cause of adverse events and mortality in other patient groups including those with chronic illness or chronic inflammation surgical patients bed ridden individuals patients with complete or partial paralysis persons with conditions precluding movement such as lung conditions or morbid obesity and orthopedic patients. When they are not otherwise contraindicated preventative methods include calf compression and anticoagulants e.g. low molecular weight heparin . These preventative methods can reduce but not eliminate the risk of thrombosis. Because these preventative methods are not always effective and are contraindicated for some patients and because anticoagulants can cause potentially lethal side effects such as major bleeding there is a need for alternative methods to prevent thrombosis in these patients. Such methods should improve patient outcomes.

Interleukin 6 hereinafter IL 6 also known as interferon B cell differentiation factor B cell stimulatory factor 2 hepatocyte stimulatory factor hybridoma growth factor and plasmacytoma growth factor is a multifunctional cytokine involved in numerous biological processes such as the regulation of the acute inflammatory response the modulation of specific immune responses including B and T cell differentiation bone metabolism thrombopoiesis epidermal proliferation menses neuronal cell differentiation neuroprotection aging cancer and the inflammatory reaction occurring in Alzheimer s disease. See A. Papassotiropoulos et al Neurobiology of Aging 22 863 871 2001 .

IL 6 is a member of a family of cytokines that promote cellular responses through a receptor complex consisting of at least one subunit of the signal transducing glycoprotein gp130 and the IL 6 receptor IL 6R also known as gp80 . The IL 6R may also be present in a soluble form sIL 6R . IL 6 binds to IL 6R which then dimerizes the signal transducing receptor gp130. See Jones S A J. Immunology 175 3463 3468 2005 .

In humans the gene encoding IL 6 is organized in five exons and four introns and maps to the short arm of chromosome 7 at 7p21. Translation of IL 6 RNA and post translational processing result in the formation of a 21 to 28 kDa protein with 184 amino acids in its mature form. See A. Papassotiropoulos et al Neurobiology of Aging 22 863 871 2001 .

As set forth in greater detail herein IL 6 is believed to play a role in the development of a multitude of diseases and disorders including but not limited to fatigue cachexia autoimmune diseases diseases of the skeletal system cancer heart disease obesity diabetes asthma Alzheimer s disease and multiple sclerosis. Due to the perceived involvement of IL 6 in a wide range of diseases and disorders there remains a need in the art for compositions and methods useful for preventing or treating diseases associated with IL 6 as well as methods of screening to identify patients having diseases or disorders associated with IL 6. Particularly preferred anti IL 6 compositions are those having minimal or minimizing adverse reactions when administered to the patient. Compositions or methods that reduce or inhibit diseases or disorders associated with IL 6 are beneficial to the patient in need thereof.

The function of IL 6 is not restricted to the immune response as it acts in hematopoiesis thrombopoiesis osteoclast formation elicitation of hepatic acute phase response resulting in the elevation of C reactive protein CRP and serum amyloid A SAA protein. It is known to be a growth factor for epidermal keratinocytes renal mesangial cells myeloma and plasmacytoma cells Grossman et al. 1989 Prot Natl Acad. Sci. 86 16 6367 6371 Horii et al. 1989 J Immunol 143 12 3949 3955 Kawano et al. 1988 Nature 332 6159 83 85 . IL 6 is produced by a wide range of cell types including monocytes macrophages fibroblasts epidermal keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells renal messangial cells glial cells condrocytes T and B cells and some tumor cells Akira et al 1990 FASEB J. 4 11 2860 2867 . Except for tumor cells that constitutively produce IL 6 normal cells do not express IL 6 unless appropriately stimulated.

Elevated IL 6 levels have been observed in many types of cancer including breast cancer leukemia ovarian cancer prostate cancer pancreatic cancer lymphoma lung cancer renal cell carcinoma colorectal cancer and multiple myeloma e.g. Chopra et al. 2004 MJAFI 60 45 49 Songur et al. 2004 Tumori 90 196 200 Blay et al. 1992 Cancer Research 52 3317 3322 Nikiteas et al. 2005 World J. Gasterenterol. 11 1639 1643 reviewed in Heikkila et al. 2008 Eur J Cancer 44 937 945 . As noted above IL 6 is known or suspected to play a role in promoting proliferation or survival of at least some types of cancer. Moreover some of these studies have demonstrated correlation between IL 6 levels and patient outcome. Together these results suggest the possibility that inhibition of IL 6 can be therapeutically beneficial. Indeed clinical studies reviewed in Trikha et al. 2003 Clinical Cancer Research 9 4653 4665 have shown some improvement in patient outcomes due to administration of various anti IL 6 antibodies particularly in those cancers in which IL 6 plays a direct role promoting cancer cell proliferation or survival.

As noted above IL 6 stimulates the hepatic acute phase response resulting in increased production of CRP and elevated serum CRP levels. For this reason C reactive protein CRP has been reported to comprise a surrogate marker of IL 6 activity. Thus elevated IL 6 activity can be detected through measurement of serum CRP. Conversely effective suppression of IL 6 activity e.g. through administration of a neutralizing anti IL 6 antibody can be detected by the resulting decrease in serum CRP levels.

A recent clinical trial demonstrated that administration of rosuvastatin to apparently healthy individuals having elevated CRP greater than 2.0 mg l reduced their CRP levels by 37 and greatly decreased the incidence of myocardial infarction stroke arterial revascularization hospitalization for unstable angina or death from cardiovascular causes. Ridker et al. N Engl J. Med. 2008 Nov. 9 Epub ahead of print .

In addition to its direct role in pathogenesis of some cancers and other diseases chronically elevated IL 6 levels appear to adversely affect patient well being and quality of life. For example elevated IL 6 levels have been reported to be associated with cachexia and fever and reduced serum albumin. Gauldie et al. 1987 PNAS 84 7251 7253 Heinric et al. 1990 265 621 636 Zamir et al. 1993 Metabolism 42 204 208 Zamir et al. 1992 Arch Surg 127 170 174. Inhibition of IL 6 by a neutralizing antibody has been reported to ameliorate fever and cachexia in cancer patients though improvement in these patients serum albumin level has not been reported Emille et al. 1994 Blood 84 2472 2479 Blay et al. 1992 Cancer Research 52 3317 3322 Bataille et al. 1995 Blood 86 685 691 .

Numerous studies have suggested that CRP is a valuable prognostic factor in cancer patients with elevated CRP levels predicting poor outcome. See e.g. Hefler et al Clin Cancer Res 2008 Feb. 1 14 3 710 4 Nagaoka et al Liver Int 2007 October 27 8 1091 7 Heildcil et al J Epidemiol Community Health 2007 September 61 9 824 33 Review Hara et al Anticancer Res 2007 July August 27 4C 3001 4 Polterauer et al Gynecol Oncol 2007 October 107 1 114 7 Epub 2007 Jul. 6 Tingstedt et al Scand J Gastroenterol 2007 June 42 6 754 9 Suh et al Support Care Cancer 2007 June 15 6 613 20 Epub 2007 Jan. 18 Gerhardt et al World J Gastroenterol 2006 Sep. 14 12 34 5495 500 McArdle et 4 Urol Int 2006 77 2 127 9 Guillem et al Dis Esophagus 2005 18 3 146 50 Brown et al Cancer 2005 Jan. 15 103 2 377 82. Decreased serum albumin hypoalbuminemia is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality in many critical illnesses including cancers e.g. Vigano et al. Arch Intern Med 2000 Mar. 27 160 6 861 8 Hauser et al. Support Care Cancer 2006 October 14 10 999 1011 Seve et al. Cancer 2006 Dec. 1 107 11 2698 705 . The apparent link between hypoalbuminemia and poor patient outcome suggests that restoring albumin levels through direct albumin infusion could promote patient survival however albumin infusion has not improved survival of patients with advanced cancer Demirkazik et al. Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 21 2002 abstr 2892 or other critically ill patients groups reviewed in Wilkes et al. Ann Intern Med 2001 Aug. 7 135 3 149 64 .

The Glasgow Prognostic Score GPS is an inflammation based prognostic score that combines levels of albumin 10 mg L 1 point Forrest et al. Br J Cancer 2004 May 4 90 9 1704 6 . Since its introduction in 2004 the Glasgow Prognostic Score has already been shown to have prognostic value as a predictor of mortality in numerous cancers including gastro esophageal cancer non small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer bronchogenic cancer and metastatic renal cancer Forrest et al. Br J Cancer 2004 May 4 90 9 1704 6 Sharma et al. Clin Colorectal Cancer 2008 September 7 5 331 7 Sharma et al. Eur J Cancer 2008 January 44 2 251 6 McMillan et al. Nutr Cancer 2001 41 1 2 64 9 McMillan Proc Nutr Soc 2008 August 67 3 257 62 Ramsey et al. Cancer 2007 Jan. 15 109 2 205 12 . Because the combination of elevated CRP and reduced albumin predicts cancer patient mortality a treatment that both lowers CRP and raises albumin would suggest a strong possibility of also promoting patient survival.

U.S. patent application publication no. 20080081041 relating to treatment of cancer using an anti IL 6 antibody discloses that since IL 6 is associated with disease activity and since CRP is a surrogate marker of IL 6 activity sustained suppression of CRP by neutralization of IL 6 by their anti IL 6 antibody CNTO 328 Zaki et al. Int J Cancer 2004 Sep. 10 111 4 592 5 may be assumed necessary to achieve biological activity.

The same patent application indicates that the relationship between IL 6 and CRP in patients with benign and malignant prostate disease was previously examined by McArdle McArdle et al. 2004 Br J Cancer 91 10 1755 1757 . McArdle reportedly found no significant differences between the concentrations of IL 6 and CRP in the patients with benign disease compared with prostate cancer patients in the cancer patients there was a significant increase in both IL 6 and CRP concentration with increasing tumor grade. The median serum CRP value for the 86 subjects with prostate cancer was 1.8 mg L. Based thereon the inventors in this patent application postulate a proposed dose and schedule wherein 6 mg kg of an anti IL 6 antibody CNTO 328 is administered every 2 weeks and allege that this is likely to achieve sustained suppression of CRP in subjects with metastatic HRPC.

IL 6 signaling is mediated by the Jak Tyk family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases including JAK1 JAK2 and JAK3 reviewed in Murray J. Immunol. 2007 Mar. 1 178 5 2623 9 . Sivash et al. report abrogation of IL 6 mediated JAK signaling by the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15d PGJin oral squamous carcinoma cells. British Journal of Cancer 2004 91 1074 1080. These results suggest that inhibitors of JAK1 JAK2 or JAK3 could be employed as antagonists of IL 6.

Ulanova et al. report that inhibition of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Syk using siRNA decreased production of IL 6 by epithelial cells. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005 March 288 3 L497 507. These results suggest that an inhibitor of Syk could be employed as an antagonist of IL 6.

Kedar et al. report that treatment with thalidomide significantly reduced serum levels of CRP and IL 6 to normal or near normal levels in a substantial fraction of renal cell carcinoma patients. Int J. Cancer. 2004 Jun. 10 110 2 260 5. These results suggest that thalidomide and possibly derivatives thereof such as lenalidomide may be useful antagonists of IL 6.

In addition another published patent application US 20070292420 teaches a Phase I dose escalating study using an anti IL 6 cCLB 8 antibody for treating refractory patients with advanced stage multiple myeloma N 12 and indicate that this study demonstrated that some patients had disease stabilization. The application also reports that after discontinuation of treatment there was acceleration in the increase of M protein levels suggesting disease re bound after the withdrawal of therapy. Anti IL 6 cCLB 8 antibody inhibited free circulating IL 6.

The application also indicates that this antibody trial resulted in no toxicity except transient thrombocytopenia in two heavily pretreated patients or allergic reactions were observed and that C reactive protein CRP decreased below detection level in all patients. Their antibody cCLB 8 antibody reportedly possessed a circulating half life of 17.8 days and that there was no human anti chimeric antibody HACA immune response observed van Zaanen et al. 1998 . They allege that the administration of CNTO 328 did not cause changes in blood pressure pulse rate temperature hemoglobin liver functions and renal functions. Except for transient thrombocytopenia in two heavily pretreated patients no toxicity or allergic reactions allegedly were observed and there was no human anti chimeric antibody HACA immune response observed. Three patients in their study reportedly developed infection related complications during therapy however a possible relation with anti IL 6 cCLB 8 antibody was concluded by the inventors to be unlikely because infectious complications are reportedly common in end stage multiple myeloma and are a major cause of death. They conclude based on their results that this anti IL 6 cCLB 8 antibody was safe in multiple myeloma patients.

The present invention is an extension of Applicants previous invention which is directed to specific antibodies and fragments thereof having binding specificity for IL 6 in particular antibodies having specific epitopic specificity and or functional properties and novel therapies using these and other anti IL 6 antibodies.

Clinical measurements of D dimer levels are routinely performed e.g. using a red blood cell agglutination test ELISA etc. reviewed in Dempfle Semin Vasc Med 2005 November 5 4 315 20 . Measurements of D dimer may vary depending on the measurement method and testing lab nonetheless a normal reference range may be readily established for any particular method and testing lab e.g. by taking measurements from healthy individuals. Accordingly an elevated D dimer level is understood by persons skilled in the art to refer to a D dimer level that is above the reference range for the particular method and testing lab.

Coagulation profile As used herein coagulation profile refers generally to the functioning of the coagulation system. Both the tissue factor extrinsic and contact activation intrinsic pathways of clotting are components of the coagulation profile. A normal coagulation profile refers to coagulation functioning as in a normal healthy individual i.e. maintaining balance between ability to control bleeding and tendency towards excessive clotting thrombotic tendency . An abnormal coagulation profile may be a decrease or an increase in coagulation tendency. One particularly abnormal coagulation profile is hypercoagulation which refers to a greatly increased risk of excessive clot formation resulting in high risk of thrombosis. Coagulation profile may be assessed by various tests and assays known in the art such as the activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT test prothrombin time PT test typical reference range of 12 to 15 second measurements derived from the PT test such as prothrombin ratio PR and international normalized ratio INR typical reference range 0.8 to 1.2 fibrinogen testing e.g. the Clauss method Clauss A Rapid Physiological Coagulation Method for the Determination of Fibrinogen German Acta Haematol 1957 17 237 46 or the Ellis method Ellis B C and Stransky A A Quick and Accurate Method for the Determination of Fibrinogen in Plasma J Lab Clin Med 1961 58 477 88 assays for activated protein C resistance protein C protein S and antithrombin assays for antiphospholipid antibodies lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies elevated homocysteine assays for plasminogen dysfibrinogenemia heparin cofactor II or platelet hyperaggregability. Other assays useful to assess coagulation profile include measurement of clotting factors and or indicators of clotting such as serum levels of D dimer Factor II Factor V Factor VIII Factor IX Factor XI Factor XII F fibrin degradation products thrombin antithrombin III complex thrombocytosis fibrinogen plasminogen prothrombin and von Willebrand factor. Worsening in coagulation profile refers to a measurable change in an indicator of coagulation e.g. any of the aforementioned assays that reflects a deterioration of the normal coagulation tendency such that the measured value becomes abnormal or deviates farther from the normal range than previously. Improvement in coagulation profile refers to a measurable change in an indicator of coagulation e.g. any of the aforementioned assays that reflects a partial or full restoration of the normal coagulation tendency i.e. after a therapeutic intervention such as administration of an anti IL 6 antibody the measured value is in the normal range or closer to the normal range than prior to the therapeutic intervention.

Disease or condition As used herein disease or condition refers to a disease or condition that a patient has been diagnosed with or is suspected of having particularly a disease or condition associated with elevated IL 6. A disease or condition encompasses without limitation thereto the side effects of medications or treatments such as radiation therapy as well as idiopathic conditions characterized by symptoms that include elevated IL 6. In the context of treating or preventing thrombosis or hypoercoagulation these diseases or conditions will include any that are associated with hypercoagulation or thrombosis or with increased risk of developing thrombosis or hypercoagulation or a treatment regimen such as a drug chemotherapy advanced cancer or radiation therapy that is associated with increased risk of hypercoagulation or thrombosis. Such conditions are disclosed herein.

Cachexia As used herein cachexia also known as wasting disease refers to any disease marked especially by progressive emaciation weakness general ill health malnutrition loss of body mass loss of muscle mass or an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle in the context of a chronic inflammatory response reviewed in Kotler Ann Intern Med. 2000 Oct. 17 133 8 622 34 . Diseases and conditions in which cachexia is frequently observed include cancer rheumatoid arthritis AIDS heart disease dehydration malnutrition lead exposure malaria respiratory disease old age hypothyroidism tuberculosis hypopituitarism neurasthenia hypernatremia hyponatremia renal disease splenica ankylosing spondylitis failure to thrive faltering growth and other diseases particularly chronic diseases. Cachexia may also be idiopathic arising from an uncertain cause . Weight assessment in a patient is understood to exclude growths or fluid accumulations e.g. tumor weight extravascular fluid accumulation etc. Cachexia may be assessed by measurement of a patient s total body mass exclusive of growths or fluid accumulations total lean fat free body mass lean mass of the arms and legs appendicular lean mass e.g. measured using dual energy x ray absorptiometry or bioelectric impedance spectroscopy and or lean body mass index lean body mass divided by the square of the patient s height .

Weakness As used herein weakness refers physical fatigue which typically manifests as a loss of muscle strength and or endurance. Weakness may be central affecting most or all of the muscles in the body or peripheral affecting a subset of muscles . Weakness includes true weakness in which a patient s muscles have a decrease in some measure of peak and or sustained force output and perceived weakness in which a patient perceives that a greater effort is required for performance of a task even though objectively measured strength remains nearly the same and may be objectively measured or self reported by the patient. For example weakness may be objectively measured using the hand grip strength test a medically recognized test for evaluating muscle strength typically employing a handgrip dynamometer.

Fatigue As used herein fatigue refers to mental fatigue for physical fatigue see weakness . Fatigue includes drowsiness somnolence and or decreased attention. Fatigue may be measured using a variety of tests known in the art such as the FACIT F Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue test. See e.g. Cella D. Lai J. S. Chang C. H. Peterman A. Slavin M. 2002 . Fatigue in cancer patients compared with fatigue in the general population. Cancer 94 2 528 538 Cella D. Eton D. T. Lai F J S. Peterman A. H Merkel D. E. 2002 .

Journal of Pain Symptom Management 24 6 547 561.

Fever As used herein fever refers to a body temperature set point that is elevated by at least 1 to 2 degrees Celsius. Fever is often associated with a subjective feeling of hypothermia exhibited as a cold sensation shivering increased heart rate and respiration rate by which the individual s body reaches the increased set point. As is well understood in the medical arts normal body temperature typically varies with activity level and time of day with highest temperatures observed in the afternoon and early evening hours and lowest temperatures observed during the second half of the sleep cycle and temperature measurements may be influenced by external factors such as mouth breathing consumption of food or beverage smoking or ambient temperature depending on the type of measurement . Moreover the normal temperature set point for individuals may vary by up to about 0.5 degrees Celsius thus a medical professional may interpret an individual s temperature in view of these factors to diagnose whether a fever is present. Generally speaking a fever is typically diagnosed by a core body temperature above 38.0 degrees Celsius an oral temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius or an axillary temperature above 37.2 degrees Celsius.

Improved As used herein improved improvement and other grammatical variants includes any beneficial change resulting from a treatment. A beneficial change is any way in which a patient s condition is better than it would have been in the absence of the treatment. Improved includes prevention of an undesired condition slowing the rate at which a condition worsens delaying the development of an undesired condition and restoration to an essentially normal condition. For example improvement in cachexia encompasses any increase in patient s mass such as total body mass excluding weight normally excluded during assessment of cachexia e.g. tumor weight extravascular fluid accumulation etc. lean body mass and or appendicular lean mass as well as any delay or slowing in the rate of loss of mass or prevention or slowing of loss of mass associated with a disease or condition with which the patient has been diagnosed. For another example improvement in weakness encompasses any increase in patient s strength as well as any delay or slowing in the rate of loss of strength or prevention or slowing of loss of strength associated with a disease or condition with which the patient has been diagnosed. For yet another example improvement in fatigue encompasses any decrease in patient s fatigue as well as any delay or slowing in the rate of increase of fatigue or prevention or slowing of increase in fatigue associated with a disease or condition with which the patient has been diagnosed. For still another example improvement in fever encompasses any decrease in patient s fever as well as any delay or slowing in the rate of increase in fever or prevention or slowing of increase in fever associated with a disease or condition with which the patient has been diagnosed.

Effective amount As used herein effective amount amount effective to amount of X effective to and the like refer to an amount of an active ingredient that is effective to relieve or reduce to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease in need of treatment or to retard initiation of clinical markers or symptoms of a disease in need of prevention when the compound is administered. Thus an effective amount refers to an amount of the active ingredient which exhibit effects such as i reversing the rate of progress of a disease ii inhibiting to some extent further progress of the disease and or iii relieving to some extent or preferably eliminating one or more symptoms associated with the disease. The effective amount may be empirically determined by experimenting with the compounds concerned in known in vivo and in vitro model systems for a disease in need of treatment. The context in which the phrase effective amount is used may indicate a particular desired effect. For example an amount of an anti IL 6 antibody effective to prevent or treat a hypercoagulable state and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti IL 6 antibody that when administered to a subject will cause a measurable improvement in the subject s coagulation profile or prevent slow delay or arrest a worsening of the coagulation profile for which the subject is at risk. An effective amount will vary according to the weight sex age and medical history of the individual as well as the severity of the patient s condition s the type of disease s mode of administration and the like. An effective amount may be readily determined using routine experimentation e.g. by titration administration of increasing dosages until an effective dosage is found and or by reference to amounts that were effective for prior patients. Generally the anti IL 6 antibodies of the present invention will be administered in dosages ranging between about 0.1 mg kg and about 20 to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight.

Mating competent yeast species In the present invention this is intended to broadly encompass any diploid or tetraploid yeast which can be grown in culture. Such species of yeast may exist in a haploid diploid or tetraploid form. The cells of a given ploidy may under appropriate conditions proliferate for indefinite number of generations in that form. Diploid cells can also sporulate to form haploid cells. Sequential mating can result in tetraploid strains through further mating or fusion of diploid strains. In the present invention the diploid or polyploidal yeast cells are preferably produced by mating or spheroplast fusion.

In one embodiment of the invention the mating competent yeast is a member of the Saccharomycetaceae family which includes the genera and . Other types of yeast potentially useful in the invention include and

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the mating competent yeast is a member of the genus . In a further preferred embodiment of the invention the mating competent yeast of the genus is one of the following species and . In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the mating competent yeast of the genus is the species

Haploid Yeast Cell A cell having a single copy of each gene of its normal genomic chromosomal complement.

Diploid Yeast Cell A cell having two copies alleles of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement typically formed by the process of fusion mating of two haploid cells.

Tetraploid Yeast Cell A cell having four copies alleles of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement typically formed by the process of fusion mating of two haploid cells. Tetraploids may carry two three four or more different expression cassettes. Such tetraploids might be obtained in by selective mating homozygotic heterothallic a a and alpha alpha diploids and in by sequential mating of haploids to obtain auxotrophic diploids. For example a met his haploid can be mated with ade his haploid to obtain diploid his and a met arg haploid can be mated with ade arg haploid to obtain diploid arg then the diploid his x diploid arg to obtain a tetraploid prototroph. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that reference to the benefits and uses of diploid cells may also apply to tetraploid cells.

Yeast Mating The process by which two haploid yeast cells naturally fuse to form one diploid yeast cell.

Meiosis The process by which a diploid yeast cell undergoes reductive division to form four haploid spore products. Each spore may then germinate and form a haploid vegetatively growing cell line.

Selectable Marker A selectable marker is a gene or gene fragment that confers a growth phenotype physical growth characteristic on a cell receiving that gene as for example through a transformation event. The selectable marker allows that cell to survive and grow in a selective growth medium under conditions in which cells that do not receive that selectable marker gene cannot grow. Selectable marker genes generally fall into several types including positive selectable marker genes such as a gene that confers on a cell resistance to an antibiotic or other drug temperature when two ts mutants are crossed or a ts mutant is transformed negative selectable marker genes such as a biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell the ability to grow in a medium without a specific nutrient needed by all cells that do not have that biosynthetic gene or a mutagenized biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell inability to grow by cells that do not have the wild type gene and the like. Suitable markers include but are not limited to ZEO G418 LYS3 MET1 MET3 a ADE1 ADE3 URA3 and the like.

Expression Vector These DNA vectors contain elements that facilitate manipulation for the expression of a foreign protein within the target host cell. Conveniently manipulation of sequences and production of DNA for transformation is first performed in a bacterial host e.g. and usually vectors will include sequences to facilitate such manipulations including a bacterial origin of replication and appropriate bacterial selection marker. Selection markers encode proteins necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media. Exemplary vectors and methods for transformation of yeast are described for example in Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. 2000 . Methods in yeast genetics a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course manual. Plainview N.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

Expression vectors for use in the methods of the invention will further include yeast specific sequences including a selectable auxotrophic or drug marker for identifying transformed yeast strains. A drug marker may further be used to amplify copy number of the vector in a yeast host cell.

The polypeptide coding sequence of interest is operably linked to transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences that provide for expression of the polypeptide in yeast cells. These vector components may include but are not limited to one or more of the following an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence. Sequences for the secretion of the polypeptide may also be included e.g. a signal sequence and the like. A yeast origin of replication is optional as expression vectors are often integrated into the yeast genome.

In one embodiment of the invention the polypeptide of interest is operably linked or fused to sequences providing for optimized secretion of the polypeptide from yeast diploid cells.

Nucleic acids are operably linked when placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a signal sequence is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading frame. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites or alternatively via a PCR recombination method familiar to those skilled in the art Gateway Technology Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adapters or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.

Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream 5 to the start codon of a structural gene generally within about 100 to 1000 bp that control the transcription and translation of particular nucleic acid sequences to which they are operably linked. Such promoters fall into several classes inducible constitutive and repressible promoters that increase levels of transcription in response to absence of a repressor . Inducible promoters may initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

The yeast promoter fragment may also serve as the site for homologous recombination and integration of the expression vector into the same site in the yeast genome alternatively a selectable marker is used as the site for homologous recombination. transformation is described in Cregg et al. 1985 5 3376 3385.

Examples of suitable promoters from include the AOX1 and promoter Cregg et al. 1989 9 1316 1323 ICL1 promoter Menendez et al. 2003 20 13 1097 108 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase promoter GAP Waterham et al. 1997 186 1 37 44 and FLD1 promoter Shen et al. 1998 216 1 93 102 . The GAP promoter is a strong constitutive promoter and the AOX and FLD1 promoters are inducible.

Other yeast promoters include ADH1 alcohol dehydrogenase II GAL4 PHO3 PHO5 Pyk and chimeric promoters derived therefrom. Additionally non yeast promoters may be used in the invention such as mammalian insect plant reptile amphibian viral and avian promoters. Most typically the promoter will comprise a mammalian promoter potentially endogenous to the expressed genes or will comprise a yeast or viral promoter that provides for efficient transcription in yeast systems.

The polypeptides of interest may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide e.g. a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the polypeptide coding sequence that is inserted into the vector. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed through one of the standard pathways available within the host cell. The alpha factor pre pro signal has proven effective in the secretion of a variety of recombinant proteins from . Other yeast signal sequences include the alpha mating factor signal sequence the invertase signal sequence and signal sequences derived from other secreted yeast polypeptides. Additionally these signal peptide sequences may be engineered to provide for enhanced secretion in diploid yeast expression systems. Other secretion signals of interest also include mammalian signal sequences which may be heterologous to the protein being secreted or may be a native sequence for the protein being secreted. Signal sequences include pre peptide sequences and in some instances may include propeptide sequences. Many such signal sequences are known in the art including the signal sequences found on immunoglobulin chains e.g. K28 preprotoxin sequence PHA E FACE human MCP 1 human serum albumin signal sequences human Ig heavy chain human Ig light chain and the like. For example see Hashimoto et. al. Protein Eng 11 2 75 1998 and Kobayashi et. al. Therapeutic Apheresis 2 4 257 1998 .

Transcription may be increased by inserting a transcriptional activator sequence into the vector. These activators are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp which act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Transcriptional enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent having been found 5 and 3 to the transcription unit within an intron as well as within the coding sequence itself. The enhancer may be spliced into the expression vector at a position 5 or 3 to the coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from 3 to the translation termination codon in untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA.

Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above listed components employs standard ligation techniques or PCR recombination methods. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved tailored and re ligated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required or via recombination methods. For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed the ligation mixtures are used to transform host cells and successful transformants selected by antibiotic resistance e.g. ampicillin or Zeocin phleomycin where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and or sequenced.

As an alternative to restriction and ligation of fragments recombination methods based on att sites and recombination enzymes may be used to insert DNA sequences into a vector. Such methods are described for example by Landy 1989 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58 913 949 and are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods utilize intermolecular DNA recombination that is mediated by a mixture of lambda and encoded recombination proteins. Recombination occurs between specific attachment att sites on the interacting DNA molecules. For a description of att sites see Weisberg and Landy 1983 Site Specific Recombination in Phage Lambda in Weisberg ed. Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Press pp. 211 250. The DNA segments flanking the recombination sites are switched such that after recombination the att sites are hybrid sequences comprised of sequences donated by each parental vector. The recombination can occur between DNAs of any topology.

Att sites may be introduced into a sequence of interest by ligating the sequence of interest into an appropriate vector generating a PCR product containing att B sites through the use of specific primers generating a cDNA library cloned into an appropriate vector containing att sites and the like.

Folding as used herein refers to the three dimensional structure of polypeptides and proteins where interactions between amino acid residues act to stabilize the structure. While non covalent interactions are important in determining structure usually the proteins of interest will have intra and or intermolecular covalent disulfide bonds formed by two cysteine residues. For naturally occurring proteins and polypeptides or derivatives and variants thereof the proper folding is typically the arrangement that results in optimal biological activity and can conveniently be monitored by assays for activity e.g. ligand binding enzymatic activity etc.

In some instances for example where the desired product is of synthetic origin assays based on biological activity will be less meaningful. The proper folding of such molecules may be determined on the basis of physical properties energetic considerations modeling studies and the like.

The expression host may be further modified by the introduction of sequences encoding one or more enzymes that enhance folding and disulfide bond formation i.e. foldases chaperonins etc. Such sequences may be constitutively or inducibly expressed in the yeast host cell using vectors markers etc. as known in the art. Preferably the sequences including transcriptional regulatory elements sufficient for the desired pattern of expression are stably integrated in the yeast genome through a targeted methodology.

For example the eukaryotic PDI is not only an efficient catalyst of protein cysteine oxidation and disulfide bond isomerization but also exhibits chaperone activity. Co expression of PDI can facilitate the production of active proteins having multiple disulfide bonds. Also of interest is the expression of BIP immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein cyclophilin and the like. In one embodiment of the invention each of the haploid parental strains expresses a distinct folding enzyme e.g. one strain may express BIP and the other strain may express PDI or combinations thereof.

The terms desired protein or target protein are used interchangeably and refer generally to a humanized antibody or a binding portion thereof described herein. The term antibody is intended to include any polypeptide chain containing molecular structure with a specific shape that fits to and recognizes an epitope where one or more non covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. The archetypal antibody molecule is the immunoglobulin and all types of immunoglobulins IgG IgM IgA IgE IgD etc. from all sources e.g. human rodent rabbit cow sheep pig dog other mammals chicken other avians etc. are considered to be antibodies. A preferred source for producing antibodies useful as starting material according to the invention is rabbits. Numerous antibody coding sequences have been described and others may be raised by methods well known in the art. Examples thereof include chimeric antibodies human antibodies and other non human mammalian antibodies humanized antibodies single chain antibodies such as scFvs camelbodies nanobodies IgNAR single chain antibodies derived from sharks small modular immunopharmaceuticals SMIPs and antibody fragments such as Fabs Fab F ab and the like.

For example antibodies or antigen binding fragments may be produced by genetic engineering. In this technique as with other methods antibody producing cells are sensitized to the desired antigen or immunogen. The messenger RNA isolated from antibody producing cells is used as a template to make cDNA using PCR amplification. A library of vectors each containing one heavy chain gene and one light chain gene retaining the initial antigen specificity is produced by insertion of appropriate sections of the amplified immunoglobulin cDNA into the expression vectors. A combinatorial library is constructed by combining the heavy chain gene library with the light chain gene library. This results in a library of clones which co express a heavy and light chain resembling the Fab fragment or antigen binding fragment of an antibody molecule . The vectors that carry these genes are co transfected into a host cell. When antibody gene synthesis is induced in the transfected host the heavy and light chain proteins self assemble to produce active antibodies that can be detected by screening with the antigen or immunogen.

Antibody coding sequences of interest include those encoded by native sequences as well as nucleic acids that by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code are not identical in sequence to the disclosed nucleic acids and variants thereof. Variant polypeptides can include amino acid aa substitutions additions or deletions. The amino acid substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions to eliminate non essential amino acids such as to alter a glycosylation site or to minimize misfolding by substitution or deletion of one or more cysteine residues that are not necessary for function. Variants can be designed so as to retain or have enhanced biological activity of a particular region of the protein e.g. a functional domain catalytic amino acid residues etc . Variants also include fragments of the polypeptides disclosed herein particularly biologically active fragments and or fragments corresponding to functional domains. Techniques for in vitro mutagenesis of cloned genes are known. Also included in the subject invention are polypeptides that have been modified using ordinary molecular biological techniques so as to improve their resistance to proteolytic degradation or to optimize solubility properties or to render them more suitable as a therapeutic agent.

Chimeric antibodies may be made by recombinant means by combining the variable light and heavy chain regions Vand V obtained from antibody producing cells of one species with the constant light and heavy chain regions from another. Typically chimeric antibodies utilize rodent or rabbit variable regions and human constant regions in order to produce an antibody with predominantly human domains. The production of such chimeric antibodies is well known in the art and may be achieved by standard means as described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 659 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . It is further contemplated that the human constant regions of chimeric antibodies of the invention may be selected from IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgG5 IgG6 IgG7 IgG8 IgG9 IgG10 IgG11 IgG12 IgG13 IgG14 IgG15 IgG16 IgG17 IgG18 or IgG19 constant regions.

Humanized antibodies are engineered to contain even more human like immunoglobulin domains and incorporate only the complementarity determining regions of the animal derived antibody. This is accomplished by carefully examining the sequence of the hyper variable loops of the variable regions of the monoclonal antibody and fitting them to the structure of the human antibody chains. Although facially complex the process is straightforward in practice. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 187 287 incorporated fully herein by reference.

In addition to entire immunoglobulins or their recombinant counterparts immunoglobulin fragments comprising the epitope binding site e.g. Fab F ab or other fragments may be synthesized. Fragment or minimal immunoglobulins may be designed utilizing recombinant immunoglobulin techniques. For instance Fv immunoglobulins for use in the present invention may be produced by synthesizing a fused variable light chain region and a variable heavy chain region.

The term polyploid yeast that stably expresses or expresses a desired secreted heterologous polypeptide for prolonged time refers to a yeast culture that secretes said polypeptide for at least several days to a week more preferably at least a month still more preferably at least 1 6 months and even more preferably for more than a year at threshold expression levels typically at least 10 25 mg liter and preferably substantially greater.

The term polyploidal yeast culture that secretes desired amounts of recombinant polypeptide refers to cultures that stably or for prolonged periods secrete at least 10 25 mg liter of heterologous polypeptide more preferably at least 50 500 mg liter and most preferably 500 1000 mg liter or more.

A polynucleotide sequence corresponds to a polypeptide sequence if translation of the polynucleotide sequence in accordance with the genetic code yields the polypeptide sequence i.e. the polynucleotide sequence encodes the polypeptide sequence one polynucleotide sequence corresponds to another polynucleotide sequence if the two sequences encode the same polypeptide sequence.

A heterologous region or domain of a DNA construct is an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus when the heterologous region encodes a mammalian gene the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the mammalian genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. Another example of a heterologous region is a construct where the coding sequence itself is not found in nature e.g. a cDNA where the genomic coding sequence contains introns or synthetic sequences having codons different than the native gene . Allelic variations or naturally occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein.

A coding sequence is an in frame sequence of codons that in view of the genetic code correspond to or encode a protein or peptide sequence. Two coding sequences correspond to each other if the sequences or their complementary sequences encode the same amino acid sequences. A coding sequence in association with appropriate regulatory sequences may be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence will usually be located 3 to the coding sequence. A promoter sequence is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream 3 direction coding sequence. Promoter sequences typically contain additional sites for binding of regulatory molecules e.g. transcription factors which affect the transcription of the coding sequence. A coding sequence is under the control of the promoter sequence or operatively linked to the promoter when RNA polymerase binds the promoter sequence in a cell and transcribes the coding sequence into mRNA which is then in turn translated into the protein encoded by the coding sequence.

Vectors are used to introduce a foreign substance such as DNA RNA or protein into an organism or host cell. Typical vectors include recombinant viruses for polynucleotides and liposomes or other lipid aggregates for polypeptides and or polynucleotides . A DNA vector is a replicon such as plasmid phage or cosmid to which another polynucleotide segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. An expression vector is a DNA vector which contains regulatory sequences which will direct polypeptide synthesis by an appropriate host cell. This usually means a promoter to bind RNA polymerase and initiate transcription of mRNA as well as ribosome binding sites and initiation signals to direct translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide s . Incorporation of a polynucleotide sequence into an expression vector at the proper site and in correct reading frame followed by transformation of an appropriate host cell by the vector enables the production of a polypeptide encoded by said polynucleotide sequence. Exemplary expression vectors and techniques for their use are described in the following publications Old et al.

 Amplification of polynucleotide sequences is the in vitro production of multiple copies of a particular nucleic acid sequence. The amplified sequence is usually in the form of DNA. A variety of techniques for carrying out such amplification are described in a review article by Van Brunt 1990 Bio Technol. 8 4 291 294 . Polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a prototype of nucleic acid amplification and use of PCR herein should be considered exemplary of other suitable amplification techniques.

The general structure of antibodies in vertebrates now is well understood Edelman G. M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 190 5 1971 . Antibodies consist of two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23 000 daltons the light chain and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53 000 70 000 the heavy chain . The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a Y configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the Y configuration. The branch portion of the Y configuration is designated the Fregion the stem portion of the Y configuration is designated the Fregion. The amino acid sequence orientation runs from the N terminal end at the top of the Y configuration to the C terminal end at the bottom of each chain. The N terminal end possesses the variable region having specificity for the antigen that elicited it and is approximately 100 amino acids in length there being slight variations between light and heavy chain and from antibody to antibody.

The variable region is linked in each chain to a constant region that extends the remaining length of the chain and that within a particular class of antibody does not vary with the specificity of the antibody i.e. the antigen eliciting it . There are five known major classes of constant regions that determine the class of the immunoglobulin molecule IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE corresponding to and gamma mu alpha delta or epsilon heavy chain constant regions . The constant region or class determines subsequent effector function of the antibody including activation of complement Kabat E. A. Structural Concepts in Immunology and Immunochemistry 2nd Ed. p. 413 436 Holt Rinehart Winston 1976 and other cellular responses Andrews D. W. et al. Clinical Immunobiology pp 1 18 W. B. Sanders 1980 Kohl S. et al. Immunology 48 187 1983 while the variable region determines the antigen with which it will react. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda . Each heavy chain class can be paired with either kappa or lambda light chain. The light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other and the tail portions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas or by B cells.

The expression variable region or VR refers to the domains within each pair of light and heavy chains in an antibody that are involved directly in binding the antibody to the antigen. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain V at one end and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.

The expressions complementarity determining region hypervariable region or CDR refer to one or more of the hyper variable or complementarity determining regions CDRs found in the variable regions of light or heavy chains of an antibody See Kabat E. A. et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 . These expressions include the hypervariable regions as defined by Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Kabat E. et al. US Dept. of Health and Human Services 1983 or the hypervariable loops in 3 dimensional structures of antibodies Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 . The CDRs in each chain are held in close proximity by framework regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site. Within the CDRs there are select amino acids that have been described as the selectivity determining regions SDRs which represent the critical contact residues used by the CDR in the antibody antigen interaction Kashmiri S. Methods 36 25 34 2005 . The expressions framework region or FR refer to one or more of the framework regions within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody See Kabat E. A. et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 . These expressions include those amino acid sequence regions interposed between the CDRs within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody.

In particular the invention includes nucleic acid sequences and vectors containing that encode the variable heavy and light chain polypeptides in SEQ ID NO 657 and 709 and also those other variable heavy and light chain polypeptides contained in and especially the nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID encoding SEQ ID NO 657 and 709 contained in SEQ ID NO 700 and 723 or those encoding the other VH and VL polypeptide sequences contained in .

In some instances more than one exemplary polynucleotide encoding a given polypeptide sequence is provided as summarized in Table 3.

In some instances multiple sequence identifiers refer to the same polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence as summarized in Table 4. References to these sequence identifiers are understood to be interchangeable except where context indicates otherwise.

Certain exemplary embodiments include polynucleotides that hybridize under moderately or highly stringent hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide having one of the exemplary coding sequences recited in Table 1 and also include polynucleotides that hybridize under moderately or highly stringent hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide encoding the same polypeptide as a polynucleotide having one of the exemplary coding sequences recited in Table 1 or polypeptide encoded by any of the foregoing polynucleotides.

The phrase high stringency hybridization conditions refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acid but to no other sequences. High stringency conditions are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Hybridization with Nucleic Probes Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays 1993 . Generally high stringency conditions are selected to be about 5 10 C. lower than the thermal melting point Tm for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm is the temperature under defined ionic strength pH and nucleic concentration at which 50 of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium as the target sequences are present in excess at Tm 50 of the probes are occupied at equilibrium . High stringency conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration or other salts at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 C. for short probes e.g. 10 to 50 nucleotides and at least about 60 C. for long probes e.g. greater than 50 nucleotides . High stringency conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization a positive signal is at least two times background optionally 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary high stringency hybridization conditions can be as following 50 formamide 5 SSC and 1 SDS incubating at 42 C. or 5 SSC 1 SDS incubating at 65 C. with wash in 0.2 SSC and 0.1 SDS at 65 C. Such hybridizations and wash steps can be carried out for e.g. 1 2 5 10 15 30 60 or more minutes.

Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under high stringency conditions are still substantially related if the polypeptides that they encode are substantially related. This occurs for example when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderate stringency hybridization conditions. Exemplary moderate stringency hybridization conditions include a hybridization in a buffer of 40 formamide 1 M NaCl 1 SDS at 37 C. and a wash in 1 SSC at 45 C. Such hybridizations and wash steps can be carried out for e.g. 1 2 5 10 15 30 60 or more minutes. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency.

As stated previously IL 6 is a member of a family of cytokines that promote cellular responses through a receptor complex consisting of at least one subunit of the signal transducing glycoprotein gp130 and the IL 6 receptor IL 6R . The IL 6R may also be present in a soluble form sIL 6R . IL 6 binds to IL 6R which then dimerizes the signal transducing receptor gp130.

It is believed that the anti IL 6 antibodies of the invention or IL 6 binding fragments thereof are useful by exhibiting anti IL 6 activity. In one non limiting embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 antibodies of the invention or IL 6 binding fragments thereof exhibit anti IL 6 activity by binding to IL 6 which may be soluble IL 6 or cell surface expressed IL 6 and or may prevent or inhibit the binding of IL 6 to IL 6R and or activation dimerization of the gp130 signal transducing glycoprotein and the formation of IL 6 IL 6R gp130 multimers and the biological effects of any of the foregoing. The subject anti IL 6 antibodies may possess different antagonistic activities based on where i.e. epitope the particular antibody binds IL 6 and or how it affects the formation of the foregoing IL 6 complexes and or multimers and the biological effects thereof. Consequently different anti IL 6 antibodies according to the invention e.g. may be better suited for preventing or treating conditions involving the formation and accumulation of substantial soluble IL 6 such as rheumatoid arthritis whereas other antibodies may be favored in treatments wherein the prevention of IL 6 IL 6T gp130 or IL 6 IL 6R 130 multimers is a desired therapeutic outcome. This can be determined in binding and other assays.

The anti IL 6 activity of the anti IL 6 antibody of the present invention and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL 6 may also be described by their strength of binding or their affinity for IL 6. This also may affect their therapeutic properties. In one embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 antibodies of the present invention and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL 6 bind to IL 6 with a dissociation constant K of less than or equal to 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10 10 5 10or 10. Preferably the anti IL 6 antibodies and fragments thereof bind IL 6 with a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 5 10.

In another embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 activity of the anti IL 6 antibodies of the present invention and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL 6 bind to IL 6 with an off rate of less than or equal to 10S 5 10S 10S 5 10S 10S 5 10S or 10S. In one embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 antibodies of the invention and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL 6 bind to a linear or conformational IL 6 epitope.

In a further embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 activity of the anti IL 6 antibodies of the present invention and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL 6 exhibit anti IL 6 activity by ameliorating or reducing the symptoms of or alternatively treating or preventing diseases and disorders associated with IL 6. Non limiting examples of diseases and disorders associated with IL 6 are set forth infra. As noted cancer related fatigue cachexia and rheumatoid arthritis are preferred indications for the subject anti IL 6 antibodies.

In another embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 antibodies described herein or IL 6 binding fragments thereof do not have binding specificity for IL 6R or the gp 130 signal transducing glycoprotein.

In one embodiment the present invention provides methods of isolating a clonal population of antigen specific B cells that may be used for isolating at least one antigen specific cell. As described and exemplified infra these methods contain a series of culture and selection steps that can be used separately in combination sequentially repetitively or periodically. Preferably these methods are used for isolating at least one antigen specific cell which can be used to produce a monoclonal antibody which is specific to a desired antigen or a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to such an antibody.

In another embodiment the present invention provides an improvement to a method of isolating a single antibody producing B cell the improvement comprising enriching a B cell population obtained from a host that has been immunized or naturally exposed to an antigen wherein the enriching step precedes any selection steps comprises at least one culturing step and results in a clonal population of B cells that produces a single monoclonal antibody specific to said antigen.

Throughout this application a clonal population of B cells refers to a population of B cells that only secrete a single antibody specific to a desired antigen. That is to say that these cells produce only one type of monoclonal antibody specific to the desired antigen.

In the present application enriching a cell population cells means increasing the frequency of desired cells typically antigen specific cells contained in a mixed cell population e.g. a B cell containing isolate derived from a host that is immunized against a desired antigen. Thus an enriched cell population encompasses a cell population having a higher frequency of antigen specific cells as a result of an enrichment step but this population of cells may contain and produce different antibodies.

The general term cell population encompasses pre and a post enrichment cell populations keeping in mind that when multiple enrichment steps are performed a cell population can be both pre and post enrichment. For example in one embodiment the present invention provides a method 

Each cell population may be used directly in the next step or it can be partially or wholly frozen for long or short term storage or for later steps. Also cells from a cell population can be individually suspended to yield single cell suspensions. The single cell suspension can be enriched such that a single cell suspension serves as the pre enrichment cell population. Then one or more antigen specific single cell suspensions together form the enriched cell population the antigen specific single cell suspensions can be grouped together e.g. re plated for further analysis and or antibody production.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method of enriching a cell population to yield an enriched cell population having an antigen specific cell frequency that is about 50 to about 100 or increments therein. Preferably the enriched cell population has an antigen specific cell frequency greater than or equal to about 50 60 70 75 80 90 95 99 or 100 .

In another embodiment the present invention provides a method of enriching a cell population whereby the frequency of antigen specific cells is increased by at least about 2 fold 5 fold 10 fold 20 fold 50 fold 100 fold or increments therein.

Throughout this application the term increment is used to define a numerical value in varying degrees of precision e.g. to the nearest 10 1 0.1 0.01 etc. The increment can be rounded to any measurable degree of precision and the increment need not be rounded to the same degree of precision on both sides of a range. For example the range 1 to 100 or increments therein includes ranges such as 20 to 80 5 to 50 and 0.4 to 98. When a range is open ended e.g. a range of less than 100 increments therein means increments between 100 and the measurable limit. For example less than 100 or increments therein means 0 to 100 or increments therein unless the feature e.g. temperature is not limited by 0.

Antigen specificity can be measured with respect to any antigen. The antigen can be any substance to which an antibody can bind including but not limited to peptides proteins or fragments thereof carbohydrates organic and inorganic molecules receptors produced by animal cells bacterial cells and viruses enzymes agonists and antagonists of biological pathways hormones and cytokines. Exemplary antigens include but are not limited to IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 IL 13 IL 18 IFN IFN BAFF CXCL13 IP 10 VEGF EPO EGF HRG Hepatocyte Growth Factor HGF and Hepcidin. Preferred antigens include IL 6 IL 13 TNF VEGF Hepatocyte Growth Factor HGF and Hepcidin. In a method utilizing more than one enrichment step the antigen used in each enrichment step can be the same as or different from one another. Multiple enrichment steps with the same antigen may yield a large and or diverse population of antigen specific cells multiple enrichment steps with different antigens may yield an enriched cell population with cross specificity to the different antigens.

Enriching a cell population can be performed by any cell selection means known in the art for isolating antigen specific cells. For example a cell population can be enriched by chromatographic techniques e.g. Miltenyi bead or magnetic bead technology. The beads can be directly or indirectly attached to the antigen of interest. In a preferred embodiment the method of enriching a cell population includes at least one chromatographic enrichment step.

A cell population can also be enriched by performed by any antigen specificity assay technique known in the art e.g. an ELISA assay or a halo assay. ELISA assays include but are not limited to selective antigen immobilization e.g. biotinylated antigen capture by streptavidin avidin or neutravidin coated plate non specific antigen plate coating and through an antigen build up strategy e.g. selective antigen capture followed by binding partner addition to generate a heteromeric protein antigen complex . The antigen can be directly or indirectly attached to a solid matrix or support e.g. a column. A halo assay comprises contacting the cells with antigen loaded beads and labeled anti host antibody specific to the host used to harvest the B cells. The label can be e.g. a fluorophore. In one embodiment at least one assay enrichment step is performed on at least one single cell suspension. In another embodiment the method of enriching a cell population includes at least one chromatographic enrichment step and at least one assay enrichment step.

Methods of enriching a cell population by size or density are known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 627 052. These steps can be used in the present method in addition to enriching the cell population by antigen specificity.

The cell populations of the present invention contain at least one cell capable of recognizing an antigen. Antigen recognizing cells include but are not limited to B cells plasma cells and progeny thereof. In one embodiment the present invention provides a clonal cell population containing a single type of antigen specific B cell i.e. the cell population produces a single monoclonal antibody specific to a desired antigen.

In such embodiment it is believed that the clonal antigen specific population of B cells consists predominantly of antigen specific antibody secreting cells which are obtained by the novel culture and selection protocol provided herein. Accordingly the present invention also provides methods for obtaining an enriched cell population containing at least one antigen specific antibody secreting cell. In one embodiment the present invention provides an enriched cell population containing about 50 to about 100 or increments therein or greater than or equal to about 60 70 80 90 or 100 of antigen specific antibody secreting cells.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method of isolating a single B cell by enriching a cell population obtained from a host before any selection steps e.g. selecting a particular B cell from a cell population and or selecting an antibody produced by a particular cell. The enrichment step can be performed as one two three or more steps. In one embodiment a single B cell is isolated from an enriched cell population before confirming whether the single B cell secretes an antibody with antigen specificity and or a desired property.

In one embodiment a method of enriching a cell population is used in a method for antibody production and or selection. Thus the present invention provides a method comprising enriching a cell population before selecting an antibody. The method can include the steps of preparing a cell population comprising at least one antigen specific cell enriching the cell population by isolating at least one antigen specific cell to form an enriched cell population and inducing antibody production from at least one antigen specific cell. In a preferred embodiment the enriched cell population contains more than one antigen specific cell. In one embodiment each antigen specific cell of the enriched population is cultured under conditions that yield a clonal antigen specific B cell population before isolating an antibody producing cell therefrom and or producing an antibody using said B cell or a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to such an antibody. In contrast to prior techniques where antibodies are produced from a cell population with a low frequency of antigen specific cells the present invention allows antibody selection from among a high frequency of antigen specific cells. Because an enrichment step is used prior to antibody selection the majority of the cells preferably virtually all of the cells used for antibody production are antigen specific. By producing antibodies from a population of cells with an increased frequency of antigen specificity the quantity and variety of antibodies are increased.

In the antibody selection methods of the present invention an antibody is preferably selected after an enrichment step and a culture step that results in a clonal population of antigen specific B cells. The methods can further comprise a step of sequencing a selected antibody or portions thereof from one or more isolated antigen specific cells. Any method known in the art for sequencing can be employed and can include sequencing the heavy chain light chain variable region s and or complementarity determining region s CDR .

In addition to the enrichment step the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antigen recognition and or antibody functionality. For example the desired antibodies may have specific structural features such as binding to a particular epitope or mimicry of a particular structure antagonist or agonist activity or neutralizing activity e.g. inhibiting binding between the antigen and a ligand. In one embodiment the antibody functionality screen is ligand dependent. Screening for antibody functionality includes but is not limited to an in vitro protein protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein and a cell based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored e.g. proliferation response . In one embodiment the method for antibody selection includes a step of screening the cell population for antibody functionality by measuring the inhibitory concentration IC50 . In one embodiment at least one of the isolated antigen specific cells produces an antibody having an IC50 of less than about 100 50 30 25 10 g mL or increments therein.

In addition to the enrichment step the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody binding strength. Antibody binding strength can be measured by any method known in the art e.g. Biacore . In one embodiment at least one of the isolated antigen specific cells produces an antibody having a high antigen affinity e.g. a dissociation constant Kd of less than about 5 10M 1 preferably about 1 10to 5 10 1 10to 1 10 1 10to 7.5 10 1 10to 2 10 about 1.5 10or less or increments therein. In this embodiment the antibodies are said to be affinity mature. In a preferred embodiment the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of any one of Panorex edrecolomab Rituxan rituximab Herceptin traztuzumab Mylotarg gentuzumab Campath alemtuzumab Zevalin ibritumomab Erbitux cetuximab Avastin bevicizumab Raptiva efalizumab Remicade infliximab Humira adalimumab and Xolair omalizumab . Preferably the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of Humira . The affinity of an antibody can also be increased by known affinity maturation techniques. In one embodiment at least one cell population is screened for at least one of preferably both antibody functionality and antibody binding strength.

In addition to the enrichment step the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody sequence homology especially human homology. In one embodiment at least one of the isolated antigen specific cells produces an antibody that has a homology to a human antibody of about 50 to about 100 or increments therein or greater than about 60 70 80 85 90 or 95 homologous. The antibodies can be humanized to increase the homology to a human sequence by techniques known in the art such as CDR grafting or selectivity determining residue grafting SDR .

In another embodiment the present invention also provides the antibodies themselves according to any of the embodiments described above in terms of IC50 Kd and or homology.

The B cell selection protocol disclosed herein has a number of intrinsic advantages versus other methods for obtaining antibody secreting B cells and monoclonal antibodies specific to desired target antigens. These advantages include but are not restricted to the following 

First it has been found that when these selection procedures are utilized with a desired antigen such as IL 6 or TNF the methods reproducibly result in antigen specific B cells capable of generating what appears to be a substantially comprehensive complement of antibodies i.e. antibodies that bind to the various different epitopes of the antigen. Without being bound by theory it is hypothesized that the comprehensive complement is attributable to the antigen enrichment step that is performed prior to initial B cell recovery. Moreover this advantage allows for the isolation and selection of antibodies with different properties as these properties may vary depending on the epitopic specificity of the particular antibody.

Second it has been found that the B cell selection protocol reproducibly yields a clonal B cell culture containing a single B cell or its progeny secreting a single monoclonal antibody that generally binds to the desired antigen with a relatively high binding affinity i.e. picomolar or better antigen binding affinities. By contrast prior antibody selection methods tend to yield relatively few high affinity antibodies and therefore require extensive screening procedures to isolate an antibody with therapeutic potential. Without being bound by theory it is hypothesized that the protocol results in both in vivo B cell immunization of the host primary immunization followed by a second in vitro B cell stimulation secondary antigen priming step that may enhance the ability and propensity of the recovered clonal B cells to secrete a single high affinity monoclonal antibody specific to the antigen target.

Third it has been observed as shown herein with IL 6 specific B cells that the B cell selection protocol reproducibly yields enriched B cells producing IgG s that are on average highly selective antigen specific to the desired target. Antigen enriched B cells recovered by these methods are believed to contain B cells capable of yielding the desired full complement of epitopic specificities as discussed above.

Fourth it has been observed that the B cell selection protocols even when used with small antigens i.e. peptides of 100 amino acids or less e.g. 5 50 amino acids long reproducibly give rise to a clonal B cell culture that secretes a single high affinity antibody to the small antigen e.g. a peptide. This is highly surprising as it is generally quite difficult labor intensive and sometimes not even feasible to produce high affinity antibodies to small peptides. Accordingly the invention can be used to produce therapeutic antibodies to desired peptide targets e.g. viral bacterial or autoantigen peptides thereby allowing for the production of monoclonal antibodies with very discrete binding properties or even the production of a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies to different peptide targets e.g. different viral strains. This advantage may especially be useful in the context of the production of a therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine having a desired valency such as an HPV vaccine that induces protective immunity to different HPV strains.

Fifth the B cell selection protocol particularly when used with B cells derived from rabbits tends to reproducibly yield antigen specific antibody sequences that are very similar to endogenous human immunoglobulins around 90 similar at the amino acid level and that contain CDRs that possess a length very analogous to human immunoglobulins and therefore require little or no sequence modification typically at most only a few CDR residues may be modified in the parent antibody sequence and no framework exogenous residues introduced in order to eliminate potential immunogenicity concerns. In particular preferably the recombinant antibody will contain only the host rabbit CDR1 and CDR2 residues required for antigen recognition and the entire CDR3. Thereby the high antigen binding affinity of the recovered antibody sequences produced according to the B cell and antibody selection protocol remains intact or substantially intact even with humanization.

In sum these methods can be used to produce antibodies exhibiting higher binding affinities to more distinct epitopes by the use of a more efficient protocol than was previously known.

In a specific embodiment the present invention provides a method for identifying a single B cell that secretes an antibody specific to a desired antigen and that optionally possesses at least one desired functional property such as affinity avidity cytolytic activity and the like by a process including the following steps 

Typically these methods will further comprise an additional step of isolating and sequencing in whole or in part the polypeptide and nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired antibody. These sequences or modified versions or portions thereof can be expressed in desired host cells in order to produce recombinant antibodies to a desired antigen.

As noted previously it is believed that the clonal population of B cells predominantly comprises antibody secreting B cells producing antibody against the desired antigen. It is also believed based on experimental results obtained with several antigens and with different B cell populations that the clonally produced B cells and the isolated antigen specific B cells derived therefrom produced according to the invention secrete a monoclonal antibody that is typically of relatively high affinity and moreover is capable of efficiently and reproducibly producing a selection of monoclonal antibodies of greater epitopic variability as compared to other methods of deriving monoclonal antibodies from cultured antigen specific B cells. In an exemplary embodiment the population of immune cells used in such B cell selection methods will be derived from a rabbit. However other hosts that produce antibodies including non human and human hosts can alternatively be used as a source of immune B cells. It is believed that the use of rabbits as a source of B cells may enhance the diversity of monoclonal antibodies that may be derived by the methods. Also the antibody sequences derived from rabbits according to the invention typically possess sequences having a high degree of sequence identity to human antibody sequences making them favored for use in humans since they should possess little antigenicity. In the course of humanization the final humanized antibody contains a much lower foreign host residue content usually restricted to a subset of the host CDR residues that differ dramatically due to their nature versus the human target sequence used in the grafting. This enhances the probability of complete activity recovery in the humanized antibody protein.

The methods of antibody selection using an enrichment step disclosed herein include a step of obtaining an immune cell containing cell population from an immunized host. Methods of obtaining an immune cell containing cell population from an immunized host are known in the art and generally include inducing an immune response in a host and harvesting cells from the host to obtain one or more cell populations. The response can be elicited by immunizing the host against a desired antigen. Alternatively the host used as a source of such immune cells can be naturally exposed to the desired antigen such as an individual who has been infected with a particular pathogen such as a bacterium or virus or alternatively has mounted a specific antibody response to a cancer that the individual is afflicted with.

Host animals are well known in the art and include but are not limited to guinea pig rabbit mouse rat non human primate human as well as other mammals and rodents chicken cow pig goat and sheep. Preferably the host is a mammal more preferably rabbit mouse rat or human. When exposed to an antigen the host produces antibodies as part of the native immune response to the antigen. As mentioned the immune response can occur naturally as a result of disease or it can be induced by immunization with the antigen. Immunization can be performed by any method known in the art such as by one or more injections of the antigen with or without an agent to enhance immune response such as complete or incomplete Freund s adjuvant. In another embodiment the invention also contemplates intrasplenic immunization. As an alternative to immunizing a host animal in vivo the method can comprise immunizing a host cell culture in vitro.

After allowing time for the immune response e.g. as measured by serum antibody detection host animal cells are harvested to obtain one or more cell populations. In a preferred embodiment a harvested cell population is screened for antibody binding strength and or antibody functionality. A harvested cell population is preferably from at least one of the spleen lymph nodes bone marrow and or peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs . The cells can be harvested from more than one source and pooled. Certain sources may be preferred for certain antigens. For example the spleen lymph nodes and PBMCs are preferred for IL 6 and the lymph nodes are preferred for TNF. The cell population is harvested about 20 to about 90 days or increments therein after immunization preferably about 50 to about 60 days. A harvested cell population and or a single cell suspension therefrom can be enriched screened and or cultured for antibody selection. The frequency of antigen specific cells within a harvested cell population is usually about 1 to about 5 or increments therein.

In one embodiment a single cell suspension from a harvested cell population is enriched preferably by using Miltenyi beads. From the harvested cell population having a frequency of antigen specific cells of about 1 to about 5 an enriched cell population is thus derived having a frequency of antigen specific cells approaching 100 .

The method of antibody selection using an enrichment step includes a step of producing antibodies from at least one antigen specific cell from an enriched cell population. Methods of producing antibodies in vitro are well known in the art and any suitable method can be employed. In one embodiment an enriched cell population such as an antigen specific single cell suspension from a harvested cell population is plated at various cell densities such as 50 100 250 500 or other increments between 1 and 1000 cells per well. Preferably the sub population comprises no more than about 10 000 antigen specific antibody secreting cells more preferably about 50 10 000 about 50 5 000 about 50 1 000 about 50 500 about 50 250 antigen specific antibody secreting cells or increments therein. Then these sub populations are cultured with suitable medium e.g. an activated T cell conditioned medium particularly 1 5 activated rabbit T cell conditioned medium on a feeder layer preferably under conditions that favor the survival of a single proliferating antibody secreting cell per culture well. The feeder layer generally comprised of irradiated cell matter e.g. EL4B cells does not constitute part of the cell population. The cells are cultured in a suitable media for a time sufficient for antibody production for example about 1 day to about 2 weeks about 1 day to about 10 days at least about 3 days about 3 to about 5 days about 5 days to about 7 days at least about 7 days or other increments therein. In one embodiment more than one sub population is cultured simultaneously. Preferably a single antibody producing cell and progeny thereof survives in each well thereby providing a clonal population of antigen specific B cells in each well. At this stage the immunoglobulin G IgG produced by the clonal population is highly correlative with antigen specificity. In a preferred embodiment the IgGs exhibit a correlation with antigen specificity that is greater than about 50 more preferably greater than 70 85 90 95 99 or increments therein. See which demonstrates an exemplary correlation for IL 6. The correlations were demonstrated by setting up B cell cultures under limiting conditions to establish single antigen specific antibody products per well. Antigen specific versus general IgG synthesis was compared. Three populations were observed IgG that recognized a single format of antigen biotinylated and direct coating detectable IgG and antigen recognition irrespective of immobilization and IgG production alone. IgG production was highly correlated with antigen specificity.

A supernatant containing the antibodies is optionally collected which can be enriched screened and or cultured for antibody selection according to the steps described above. In one embodiment the supernatant is enriched preferably by an antigen specificity assay especially an ELISA assay and or screened for antibody functionality.

In another embodiment the enriched preferably clonal antigen specific B cell population from which a supernatant described above is optionally screened in order to detect the presence of the desired secreted monoclonal antibody is used for the isolation of a few B cells preferably a single B cell which is then tested in an appropriate assay in order to confirm the presence of a single antibody producing B cell in the clonal B cell population. In one embodiment about 1 to about 20 cells are isolated from the clonal B cell population preferably less than about 15 12 10 5 or 3 cells or increments therein most preferably a single cell. The screen is preferably effected by an antigen specificity assay especially a halo assay. The halo assay can be performed with the full length protein or a fragment thereof. The antibody containing supernatant can also be screened for at least one of antigen binding affinity agonism or antagonism of antigen ligand binding induction or inhibition of the proliferation of a specific target cell type induction or inhibition of lysis of a target cell and induction or inhibition of a biological pathway involving the antigen.

The identified antigen specific cell can be used to derive the corresponding nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired monoclonal antibody. An AluI digest can confirm that only a single monoclonal antibody type is produced per well. As mentioned above these sequences can be mutated such as by humanization in order to render them suitable for use in human medicaments.

As mentioned the enriched B cell population used in the process can also be further enriched screened and or cultured for antibody selection according to the steps described above which can be repeated or performed in a different order. In a preferred embodiment at least one cell of an enriched preferably clonal antigen specific cell population is isolated cultured and used for antibody selection.

The method can further include one or more steps of screening the harvested cell population for antibody binding strength affinity avidity and or antibody functionality. Suitable screening steps include but are not limited to assay methods that detect whether the antibody produced by the identified antigen specific B cell produces an antibody possessing a minimal antigen binding affinity whether the antibody agonizes or antagonizes the binding of a desired antigen to a ligand whether the antibody induces or inhibits the proliferation of a specific cell type whether the antibody induces or elicits a cytolytic reaction against target cells whether the antibody binds to a specific epitope and whether the antibody modulates inhibits or agonizes a specific biological pathway or pathways involving the antigen.

Similarly the method can include one or more steps of screening the second enriched cell population for antibody binding strength and or antibody functionality.

The method can further include a step of sequencing the polypeptide sequence or the corresponding nucleic acid sequence of the selected antibody. The method can also include a step of producing a recombinant antibody using the sequence a fragment thereof or a genetically modified version of the selected antibody. Methods for mutating antibody sequences in order to retain desired properties are well known to those skilled in the art and include humanization chimerisation production of single chain antibodies these mutation methods can yield recombinant antibodies possessing desired effector function immunogenicity stability removal or addition of glycosylation and the like. The recombinant antibody can be produced by any suitable recombinant cell including but not limited to mammalian cells such as CHO COS BHK HEK 293 bacterial cells yeast cells plant cells insect cells and amphibian cells. In one embodiment the antibodies are expressed in polyploidal yeast cells i.e. diploid yeast cells particularly

In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a method for humanizing antibody heavy and light chains. In this embodiment the following method is followed for the humanization of the heavy and light chains 

1. Identify the amino acid that is the first one following the signal peptide sequence. This is the start of Framework 1. The signal peptide starts at the first initiation methionine and is typically but not necessarily 22 amino acids in length for rabbit light chain protein sequences. The start of the mature polypeptide can also be determined experimentally by N terminal protein sequencing or can be predicted using a prediction algorithm. This is also the start of Framework 1 as classically defined by those in the field.

2. Identify the end of Framework 3. This is typically 86 90 amino acids following the start of Framework 1 and is typically a cysteine residue preceded by two tyrosine residues. This is the end of the Framework 3 as classically defined by those in the field.

3. Use the rabbit light chain sequence of the polypeptide starting from the beginning of Framework 1 to the end of Framework 3 as defined above and perform a sequence homology search for the most similar human antibody protein sequences. This will typically be a search against human germline sequences prior to antibody maturation in order to reduce the possibility of immunogenicity however any human sequences can be used. Typically a program like BLAST can be used to search a database of sequences for the most homologous. Databases of human antibody sequences can be found from various sources such as NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information .

RbtVL amino acid sequence from residues numbered 1 through 88 in is BLASTed against a human antibody germline database. The top three unique returned sequences are shown in as L12A V1 and Vx02.

4. Generally the most homologous human germline variable light chain sequence is then used as the basis for humanization. However those skilled in the art may decide to use another sequence that wasn t the highest homology as determined by the homology algorithm based on other factors including sequence gaps and framework similarities.

In L12A was the most homologous human germline variable light chain sequence and is used as the basis for the humanization of RbtVL.

5. Determine the framework and CDR arrangement FR1 FR2 FR3 CDR1 CDR2 for the human homolog being used for the light chain humanization. This is using the traditional layout as described in the field. Align the rabbit variable light chain sequence with the human homolog while maintaining the layout of the framework and CDR regions.

In the RbtVL sequence is aligned with the human homologous sequence L12A and the framework and CDR domains are indicated.

6. Replace the human homologous light chain sequence CDR1 and CDR2 regions with the CDR1 and CDR2 sequences from the rabbit sequence. If there are differences in length between the rabbit and human CDR sequences then use the entire rabbit CDR sequences and their lengths. It is possible that the specificity affinity and or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody may be unaltered if smaller or larger sequence exchanges are performed or if specific residue s are altered however the exchanges as described have been used successfully but do not exclude the possibility that other changes may be permitted.

In the CDR1 and CDR2 amino acid residues of the human homologous variable light chain L12A are replaced with the CDR1 and CDR2 amino acid sequences from the RbtVL rabbit antibody light chain sequence. The human L12A frameworks 1 2 and 3 are unaltered. The resulting humanized sequence is shown below as VLh from residues numbered 1 through 88. Note that the only residues that are different from the L12A human sequence are underlined and are thus rabbit derived amino acid residues. In this example only 8 of the 88 residues are different than the human sequence.

7. After framework 3 of the new hybrid sequence created in Step 6 attach the entire CDR3 of the rabbit light chain antibody sequence. The CDR3 sequence can be of various lengths but is typically 9 to 15 amino acid residues in length. The CDR3 region and the beginning of the following framework 4 region are defined classically and identifiable by those skilled in the art. Typically the beginning of Framework 4 and thus after the end of CDR3 consists of the sequence FGGG . . . SEQ ID NO 734 however some variation may exist in these residues.

In the CDR3 of RbtVL amino acid residues numbered 89 100 of SEQ ID NO 729 is added after the end of framework 3 in the humanized sequence indicated as VLh.

8. The rabbit light chain framework 4 which is typically the final 11 amino acid residues of the variable light chain and begins as indicated in Step 7 above and typically ends with the amino acid sequence . . . VVKR amino acid resides 101 111 of SEQ ID NO 729 is replaced with the nearest human light chain framework 4 homolog usually from germline sequence. Frequently this human light chain framework 4 is of the sequence FGGGTKVEIKR SEQ ID NO 734 . It is possible that other human light chain framework 4 sequences that are not the most homologous or otherwise different may be used without affecting the specificity affinity and or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody. This human light chain framework 4 sequence is added to the end of the variable light chain humanized sequence immediately following the CDR3 sequence from Step 7 above. This is now the end of the variable light chain humanized amino acid sequence.

In Framework 4 FR4 of the RbtVL rabbit light chain sequence is shown above a homologous human FR4 sequence. The human FR4 sequence is added to the humanized variable light chain sequence VLh right after the end of the CD3 region added in Step 7 above.

1. Identify the amino acid that is the first one following the signal peptide sequence. This is the start of Framework 1. The signal peptide starts at the first initiation methionine and is typically 19 amino acids in length for rabbit heavy chain protein sequences. Typically but not necessarily always the final 3 amino acid residues of a rabbit heavy chain signal peptide are . . . VQC followed by the start of Framework 1. The start of the mature polypeptide can also be determined experimentally by N terminal protein sequencing or can be predicted using a prediction algorithm. This is also the start of Framework 1 as classically defined by those in the field.

2. Identify the end of Framework 3. This is typically 95 100 amino acids following the start of Framework 1 and typically has the final sequence of . . . CAR although the alanine can also be a valine . This is the end of the Framework 3 as classically defined by those in the field.

3. Use the rabbit heavy chain sequence of the polypeptide starting from the beginning of Framework 1 to the end of Framework 3 as defined above and perform a sequence homology search for the most similar human antibody protein sequences. This will typically be against a database of human germline sequences prior to antibody maturation in order to reduce the possibility of immunogenicity however any human sequences can be used. Typically a program like BLAST can be used to search a database of sequences for the most homologous. Databases of human antibody sequences can be found from various sources such as NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information .

RbtVH amino acid sequence from residues numbered 1 through 98 in is BLASTed against a human antibody germline database. The top three unique returned sequences are shown in as 3 64 04 3 66 04 and 3 53 02.

4. Generally the most homologous human germline variable heavy chain sequence is then used as the basis for humanization. However those skilled in the art may decide to use another sequence that wasn t the most homologous as determined by the homology algorithm based on other factors including sequence gaps and framework similarities.

3 64 04 in was the most homologous human germline variable heavy chain sequence and is used as the basis for the humanization of RbtVH.

5. Determine the framework and CDR arrangement FR1 FR2 FR3 CDR1 CDR2 for the human homolog being used for the heavy chain humanization. This is using the traditional layout as described in the field. Align the rabbit variable heavy chain sequence with the human homolog while maintaining the layout of the framework and CDR regions.

In the RbtVH sequence is aligned with the human homologous sequence 3 64 04 and the framework and CDR domains are indicated.

6. Replace the human homologous heavy chain sequence CDR1 and CDR2 regions with the CDR1 and CDR2 sequences from the rabbit sequence. If there are differences in length between the rabbit and human CDR sequences then use the entire rabbit CDR sequences and their lengths. In addition it may be necessary to replace the final three amino acids of the human heavy chain Framework 1 region with the final three amino acids of the rabbit heavy chain Framework 1. Typically but not always in rabbit heavy chain Framework 1 these three residues follow a Glycine residue preceded by a Serine residue. In addition it may be necessary replace the final amino acid of the human heavy chain Framework 2 region with the final amino acid of the rabbit heavy chain Framework 2. Typically but not necessarily always this is a Glycine residue preceded by an Isoleucine residue in the rabbit heavy chain Framework 2. It is possible that the specificity affinity and or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody may be unaltered if smaller or larger sequence exchanges are performed or if specific residue s are altered however the exchanges as described have been used successfully but do not exclude the possibility that other changes may be permitted. For example a tryptophan amino acid residue typically occurs four residues prior to the end of the rabbit heavy chain CDR2 region whereas in human heavy chain CDR2 this residue is typically a Serine residue. Changing this rabbit tryptophan residue to a the human Serine residue at this position has been demonstrated to have minimal to no effect on the humanized antibody s specificity or affinity and thus further minimizes the content of rabbit sequence derived amino acid residues in the humanized sequence.

In The CDR1 and CDR2 amino acid residues of the human homologous variable heavy chain are replaced with the CDR1 and CDR2 amino acid sequences from the RbtVH rabbit antibody light chain sequence except for the boxed residue which is tryptophan in the rabbit sequence position number 63 and Serine at the same position in the human sequence and is kept as the human Serine residue. In addition to the CDR1 and CDR2 changes the final three amino acids of Framework 1 positions 28 30 as well as the final residue of Framework 2 position 49 are retained as rabbit amino acid residues instead of human. The resulting humanized sequence is shown below as VHh from residues numbered 1 through 98. Note that the only residues that are different from the 3 64 04 human sequence are underlined and are thus rabbit derived amino acid residues. In this example only 15 of the 98 residues are different than the human sequence.

7. After framework 3 of the new hybrid sequence created in Step 6 attach the entire CDR3 of the rabbit heavy chain antibody sequence. The CDR3 sequence can be of various lengths but is typically 5 to 19 amino acid residues in length. The CDR3 region and the beginning of the following framework 4 region are defined classically and are identifiable by those skilled in the art. Typically the beginning of framework 4 and thus after the end of CDR3 consists of the sequence WGXG . . . where X is usually Q or P SEQ ID NO 745 however some variation may exist in these residues.

The CDR3 of RbtVH amino acid residues numbered 99 110 of SEQ ID NO 735 is added after the end of framework 3 in the humanized sequence indicated as VHh.

8. The rabbit heavy chain framework 4 which is typically the final 11 amino acid residues of the variable heavy chain and begins as indicated in Step 7 above and typically ends with the amino acid sequence . . . TVSS SEQ ID NO 735 is replaced with the nearest human heavy chain framework 4 homolog usually from germline sequence. Frequently this human heavy chain framework 4 is of the sequence WGQGTLVTVSS SEQ ID NO 740 . It is possible that other human heavy chain framework 4 sequences that are not the most homologous or otherwise different may be used without affecting the specificity affinity and or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody. This human heavy chain framework 4 sequence is added to the end of the variable heavy chain humanized sequence immediately following the CDR3 sequence from Step 7 above. This is now the end of the variable heavy chain humanized amino acid sequence.

In framework 4 FR4 of the RbtVH rabbit heavy chain sequence is shown above a homologous human heavy FR4 sequence. The human FR4 sequence is added to the humanized variable heavy chain sequence VHh right after the end of the CD3 region added in Step 7 above.

The invention is also directed to the production of the antibodies described herein or fragments thereof. Recombinant polypeptides corresponding to the antibodies described herein or fragments thereof are secreted from polyploidal preferably diploid or tetraploid strains of mating competent yeast. In an exemplary embodiment the invention is directed to methods for producing these recombinant polypeptides in secreted form for prolonged periods using cultures comprising polyploid yeast i.e. at least several days to a week more preferably at least a month or several months and even more preferably at least 6 months to a year or longer. These polyploid yeast cultures will express at least 10 25 mg liter of the polypeptide more preferably at least 50 250 mg liter still more preferably at least 500 1000 mg liter and most preferably a gram per liter or more of the recombinant polypeptide s .

In one embodiment of the invention a pair of genetically marked yeast haploid cells are transformed with expression vectors comprising subunits of a desired heteromultimeric protein. One haploid cell comprises a first expression vector and a second haploid cell comprises a second expression vector. In another embodiment diploid yeast cells will be transformed with one or more expression vectors that provide for the expression and secretion of one or more of the recombinant polypeptides. In still another embodiment a single haploid cell may be transformed with one or more vectors and used to produce a polyploidal yeast by fusion or mating strategies. In yet another embodiment a diploid yeast culture may be transformed with one or more vectors providing for the expression and secretion of a desired polypeptide or polypeptides. These vectors may comprise vectors e.g. linearized plasmids or other linear DNA products that integrate into the yeast cell s genome randomly through homologous recombination or using a recombinase such as Cre Lox or Flp Frt. Optionally additional expression vectors may be introduced into the haploid or diploid cells or the first or second expression vectors may comprise additional coding sequences for the synthesis of heterotrimers heterotetramers etc. The expression levels of the non identical polypeptides may be individually calibrated and adjusted through appropriate selection vector copy number promoter strength and or induction and the like. The transformed haploid cells are genetically crossed or fused. The resulting diploid or tetraploid strains are utilized to produce and secrete fully assembled and biologically functional proteins humanized antibodies described herein or fragments thereof.

The use of diploid or tetraploid cells for protein production provides for unexpected benefits. The cells can be grown for production purposes i.e. scaled up and for extended periods of time in conditions that can be deleterious to the growth of haploid cells which conditions may include high cell density growth in minimal media growth at low temperatures stable growth in the absence of selective pressure and which may provide for maintenance of heterologous gene sequence integrity and maintenance of high level expression over time. Without wishing to be bound thereby the inventors theorize that these benefits may arise at least in part from the creation of diploid strains from two distinct parental haploid strains. Such haploid strains can comprise numerous minor autotrophic mutations which mutations are complemented in the diploid or tetraploid enabling growth and enhanced production under highly selective conditions.

Transformed mating competent haploid yeast cells provide a genetic method that enables subunit pairing of a desired protein. Haploid yeast strains are transformed with each of two expression vectors a first vector to direct the synthesis of one polypeptide chain and a second vector to direct the synthesis of a second non identical polypeptide chain. The two haploid strains are mated to provide a diploid host where optimized target protein production can be obtained.

Optionally additional non identical coding sequence s are provided. Such sequences may be present on additional expression vectors or in the first or the second expression vectors. As is known in the art multiple coding sequences may be independently expressed from individual promoters or may be coordinately expressed through the inclusion of an internal ribosome entry site or IRES which is an element that promotes direct internal ribosome entry to the initiation codon such as ATG of a cistron a protein encoding region thereby leading to the cap independent translation of the gene. IRES elements functional in yeast are described by Thompson et al. 2001 98 12866 12868.

In one embodiment of the invention antibody sequences are produced in combination with a secretory J chain which provides for enhanced stability of IgA see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 and 5 202 422 .

In a preferred embodiment the two haploid yeast strains are each auxotrophic and require supplementation of media for growth of the haploid cells. The pair of auxotrophs are complementary such that the diploid product will grow in the absence of the supplements required for the haploid cells. Many such genetic markers are known in yeast including requirements for amino acids e.g. met lys his arg etc. nucleosides e.g. ura3 ade1 etc. and the like. Amino acid markers may be preferred for the methods of the invention. Alternatively diploid cells which contain the desired vectors can be selected by other means e.g. by use of other markers such as green fluorescent protein antibiotic resistance genes various dominant selectable markers and the like.

Two transformed haploid cells may be genetically crossed and diploid strains arising from this mating event selected by their hybrid nutritional requirements and or antibiotic resistance spectra. Alternatively populations of the two transformed haploid strains are spheroplasted and fused and diploid progeny regenerated and selected. By either method diploid strains can be identified and selectively grown based on their ability to grow in different media than their parents. For example the diploid cells may be grown in minimal medium that may include antibiotics. The diploid synthesis strategy has certain advantages. Diploid strains have the potential to produce enhanced levels of heterologous protein through broader complementation to underlying mutations which may impact the production and or secretion of recombinant protein. Furthermore once stable strains have been obtained any antibiotics used to select those strains do not necessarily need to be continuously present in the growth media.

As noted above in some embodiments a haploid yeast may be transformed with a single or multiple vectors and mated or fused with a non transformed cell to produce a diploid cell containing the vector or vectors. In other embodiments a diploid yeast cell may be transformed with one or more vectors that provide for the expression and secretion of a desired heterologous polypeptide by the diploid yeast cell.

In one embodiment of the invention two haploid strains are transformed with a library of polypeptides e.g. a library of antibody heavy or light chains. Transformed haploid cells that synthesize the polypeptides are mated with the complementary haploid cells. The resulting diploid cells are screened for functional protein. The diploid cells provide a means of rapidly conveniently and inexpensively bringing together a large number of combinations of polypeptides for functional testing. This technology is especially applicable for the generation of heterodimeric protein products where optimized subunit synthesis levels are critical for functional protein expression and secretion.

In another embodiment of the invention the expression level ratio of the two subunits is regulated in order to maximize product generation. Heterodimer subunit protein levels have been shown previously to impact the final product generation Simmons L C J Immunol Methods. 2002 May 1 263 1 2 133 47 . Regulation can be achieved prior to the mating step by selection for a marker present on the expression vector. By stably increasing the copy number of the vector the expression level can be increased. In some cases it may be desirable to increase the level of one chain relative to the other so as to reach a balanced proportion between the subunits of the polypeptide. Antibiotic resistance markers are useful for this purpose e.g. Zeocin phleomycin resistance marker G418 resistance etc. and provide a means of enrichment for strains that contain multiple integrated copies of an expression vector in a strain by selecting for transformants that are resistant to higher levels of Zeocin phleomycin or G418. The proper ratio e.g. 1 1 1 2 etc. of the subunit genes may be important for efficient protein production. Even when the same promoter is used to transcribe both subunits many other factors contribute to the final level of protein expressed and therefore it can be useful to increase the number of copies of one encoded gene relative to the other. Alternatively diploid strains that produce higher levels of a polypeptide relative to single copy vector strains are created by mating two haploid strains both of which have multiple copies of the expression vectors.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors mated to form diploid strains and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. A number of minimal media suitable for the growth of yeast are known in the art. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as phosphate HEPES nucleosides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics trace elements and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

Secreted proteins are recovered from the culture medium. A protease inhibitor such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF may be useful to inhibit proteolytic degradation during purification and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants. The composition may be concentrated filtered dialyzed etc. using methods known in the art.

The diploid cells of the invention are grown for production purposes. Such production purposes desirably include growth in minimal media which media lacks pre formed amino acids and other complex biomolecules e.g. media comprising ammonia as a nitrogen source and glucose as an energy and carbon source and salts as a source of phosphate calcium and the like. Preferably such production media lacks selective agents such as antibiotics amino acids purines pyrimidines etc. The diploid cells can be grown to high cell density for example at least about 50 g L more usually at least about 100 g L and may be at least about 300 about 400 about 500 g L or more.

In one embodiment of the invention the growth of the subject cells for production purposes is performed at low temperatures which temperatures may be lowered during log phase during stationary phase or both. The term low temperature refers to temperatures of at least about 15 C. more usually at least about 17 C. and may be about 20 C. and is usually not more than about 25 C. more usually not more than about 22 C. In another embodiment of the invention the low temperature is usually not more than about 28 C. Growth temperature can impact the production of full length secreted proteins in production cultures and decreasing the culture growth temperature can strongly enhance the intact product yield. The decreased temperature appears to assist intracellular trafficking through the folding and post translational processing pathways used by the host to generate the target product along with reduction of cellular protease degradation.

The methods of the invention provide for expression of secreted active protein preferably a mammalian protein. In one embodiment secreted active antibodies as used herein refers to a correctly folded multimer of at least two properly paired chains which accurately binds to its cognate antigen. Expression levels of active protein are usually at least about 10 50 mg liter culture more usually at least about 100 mg liter preferably at least about 500 mg liter and may be 1000 mg liter or more.

The methods of the invention can provide for increased stability of the host and heterologous coding sequences during production. The stability is evidenced for example by maintenance of high levels of expression of time where the starting level of expression is decreased by not more than about 20 usually not more than 10 and may be decreased by not more than about 5 over about 20 doublings 50 doublings 100 doublings or more.

The strain stability also provides for maintenance of heterologous gene sequence integrity over time where the sequence of the active coding sequence and requisite transcriptional regulatory elements are maintained in at least about 99 of the diploid cells usually in at least about 99.9 of the diploid cells and preferably in at least about 99.99 of the diploid cells over about 20 doublings 50 doublings 100 doublings or more. Preferably substantially all of the diploid cells maintain the sequence of the active coding sequence and requisite transcriptional regulatory elements.

Other methods of producing antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example methods of producing chimeric antibodies are now well known in the art See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 to Cabilly et al. Morrison et al. P.N.A.S. USA 81 8651 55 1984 Neuberger M. S. et al. Nature 314 268 270 1985 Bouliannc G. L. et al. Nature 312 643 46 1984 the disclosures of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Likewise other methods of producing humanized antibodies are now well known in the art See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 530 101 5 585 089 5 693 762 and 6 180 370 to Queen et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 and 6 548 640 to Winter U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 054 297 6 407 213 and 6 639 055 to Carter et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 632 927 to Adair Jones P.

Antibody polypeptides of the invention having IL 6 binding specificity may also be produced by constructing using conventional techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art an expression vector containing an operon and a DNA sequence encoding an antibody heavy chain in which the DNA sequence encoding the CDRs required for antibody specificity is derived from a non human cell source preferably a rabbit B cell source while the DNA sequence encoding the remaining parts of the antibody chain is derived from a human cell source.

A second expression vector is produced using the same conventional means well known to those of ordinary skill in the art said expression vector containing an operon and a DNA sequence encoding an antibody light chain in which the DNA sequence encoding the CDRs required for antibody specificity is derived from a non human cell source preferably a rabbit B cell source while the DNA sequence encoding the remaining parts of the antibody chain is derived from a human cell source.

The expression vectors are transfected into a host cell by convention techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to produce a transfected host cell said transfected host cell cultured by conventional techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to produce said antibody polypeptides.

The host cell may be co transfected with the two expression vectors described above the first expression vector containing DNA encoding an operon and a light chain derived polypeptide and the second vector containing DNA encoding an operon and a heavy chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors contain different selectable markers but preferably achieve substantially equal expression of the heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used the vector including DNA encoding both the heavy and light chain polypeptides. The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA.

The host cells used to express the antibody polypeptides may be either a bacterial cell such as or a eukaryotic cell. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention a mammalian cell of a well defined type for this purpose such as a myeloma cell or a Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line may be used.

The general methods by which the vectors may be constructed transfection methods required to produce the host cell and culturing methods required to produce the antibody polypeptides from said host cells all include conventional techniques. Although preferably the cell line used to produce the antibody is a mammalian cell line any other suitable cell line such as a bacterial cell line such as an derived bacterial strain or a yeast cell line may alternatively be used.

Similarly once produced the antibody polypeptides may be purified according to standard procedures in the art such as for example cross flow filtration ammonium sulphate precipitation affinity column chromatography and the like.

The antibody polypeptides described herein may also be used for the design and synthesis of either peptide or non peptide mimetics that would be useful for the same therapeutic applications as the antibody polypeptides of the invention.

The invention also includes screening assays designed to assist in the identification of diseases and disorders associated with IL 6 in patients exhibiting symptoms of an IL 6 associated disease or disorder.

In one embodiment of the invention the anti IL 6 antibodies of the invention or IL 6 binding fragments thereof are used to detect the presence of IL 6 in a biological sample obtained from a patient exhibiting symptoms of a disease or disorder associated with IL 6. The presence of IL 6 or elevated levels thereof when compared to pre disease levels of IL 6 in a comparable biological sample may be beneficial in diagnosing a disease or disorder associated with IL 6.

Another embodiment of the invention provides a diagnostic or screening assay to assist in diagnosis of diseases or disorders associated with IL 6 in patients exhibiting symptoms of an IL 6 associated disease or disorder identified herein comprising assaying the level of IL 6 expression in a biological sample from said patient using a post translationally modified anti IL 6 antibody or binding fragment thereof. The anti IL 6 antibody or binding fragment thereof may be post translationally modified to include a detectable moiety such as set forth previously in the disclosure.

The IL 6 level in the biological sample is determined using a modified anti IL 6 antibody or binding fragment thereof as set forth herein and comparing the level of IL 6 in the biological sample against a standard level of IL 6 e.g. the level in normal biological samples . The skilled clinician would understand that some variability may exist between normal biological samples and would take that into consideration when evaluating results.

The above recited assay may also be useful in monitoring a disease or disorder where the level of IL 6 obtained in a biological sample from a patient believed to have an IL 6 associated disease or disorder is compared with the level of IL 6 in prior biological samples from the same patient in order to ascertain whether the IL 6 level in said patient has changed with for example a treatment regimen.

The invention is also directed to a method of in vivo imaging which detects the presence of cells which express IL 6 comprising administering a diagnostically effective amount of a diagnostic composition. Said in vivo imaging is useful for the detection and imaging of IL 6 expressing tumors or metastases and IL 6 expressing inflammatory sites for example and can be used as part of a planning regimen for design of an effective cancer or arthritis treatment protocol. The treatment protocol may include for example one or more of radiation chemotherapy cytokine therapy gene therapy and antibody therapy as well as an anti IL 6 antibody or fragment thereof.

A skilled clinician would understand that a biological sample includes but is not limited to sera plasma urine saliva mucous pleural fluid synovial fluid and spinal fluid.

The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the subject invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what is regarded as the invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to the numbers used e.g. amounts temperature concentrations etc. but some experimental errors and deviations should be allowed for. Unless otherwise indicated parts are parts by weight molecular weight is average molecular weight temperature is in degrees centigrade and pressure is at or near atmospheric.

Panels of antibodies are derived by immunizing traditional antibody host animals to exploit the native immune response to a target antigen of interest. Typically the host used for immunization is a rabbit or other host that produces antibodies using a similar maturation process and provides for a population of antigen specific B cells producing antibodies of comparable diversity e.g. epitopic diversity. The initial antigen immunization can be conducted using complete Freund s adjuvant CFA and the subsequent boosts effected with incomplete adjuvant. At about 50 60 days after immunization preferably at day 55 antibody titers are tested and the Antibody Selection ABS process is initiated if appropriate titers are established. The two key criteria for ABS initiation are potent antigen recognition and function modifying activity in the polyclonal sera.

At the time positive antibody titers are established animals are sacrificed and B cell sources isolated. These sources include the spleen lymph nodes bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs . Single cell suspensions are generated and the cell suspensions are washed to make them compatible for low temperature long term storage. The cells are then typically frozen.

To initiate the antibody identification process a small fraction of the frozen cell suspensions are thawed washed and placed in tissue culture media. These suspensions are then mixed with a biotinylated form of the antigen that was used to generate the animal immune response and antigen specific cells are recovered using the Miltenyi magnetic bead cell selection methodology. Specific enrichment is conducted using streptavidin beads. The enriched population is recovered and progressed in the next phase of specific B cell isolation.

Enriched B cells produced according to Example 1 are then plated at varying cell densities per well in a 96 well microtiter plate. Generally this is at 50 100 250 or 500 cells per well with 10 plates per group. The media is supplemented with 4 activated rabbit T cell conditioned media along with 50K frozen irradiated EL4B feeder cells. These cultures are left undisturbed for 5 7 days at which time supernatant containing secreted antibody is collected and evaluated for target properties in a separate assay setting. The remaining supernatant is left intact and the plate is frozen at 70 C. Under these conditions the culture process typically results in wells containing a mixed cell population that comprises a clonal population of antigen specific B cells i.e. a single well will only contain a single monoclonal antibody specific to the desired antigen.

Antibody containing supernatants derived from the well containing a clonal antigen specific B cell population produced according to Example 2 are initially screened for antigen recognition using ELISA methods. This includes selective antigen immobilization e.g. biotinylated antigen capture by streptavidin coated plate non specific antigen plate coating or alternatively through an antigen build up strategy e.g. selective antigen capture followed by binding partner addition to generate a heteromeric protein antigen complex . Antigen positive well supernatants are then optionally tested in a function modifying assay that is strictly dependant on the ligand. One such example is an in vitro protein protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein. Alternatively a cell based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored e.g. proliferation response is utilized. Supernatant that displays significant antigen recognition and potency is deemed a positive well. Cells derived from the original positive well are then transitioned to the antibody recovery phase.

Cells are isolated from a well that contains a clonal population of antigen specific B cells produced according to Example 2 or 3 which secrete a single antibody sequence. The isolated cells are then assayed to isolate a single antibody secreting cell. Dynal streptavidin beads are coated with biotinylated target antigen under buffered medium to prepare antigen containing microbeads compatible with cell viability. Next antigen loaded beads antibody producing cells from the positive well and a fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC labeled anti host H L IgG antibody as noted the host can be any mammalian host e.g. rabbit mouse rat etc. are incubated together at 37 C. This mixture is then re pipetted in aliquots onto a glass slide such that each aliquot has on average a single antibody producing B cell. The antigen specific antibody secreting cells are then detected through fluorescence microscopy. Secreted antibody is locally concentrated onto the adjacent beads due to the bound antigen and provides localization information based on the strong fluorescent signal. Antibody secreting cells are identified via FITC detection of antibody antigen complexes formed adjacent to the secreting cell. The single cell found in the center of this complex is then recovered using a micromanipulator. The cell is snap frozen in an eppendorf PCR tube for storage at 80 C. until antibody sequence recovery is initiated.

Antibody sequences are recovered using a combined RT PCR based method from a single isolated B cell produced according to Example 4 or an antigenic specific B cell isolated from the clonal B cell population obtained according to Example 2. Primers are designed to anneal in conserved and constant regions of the target immunoglobulin genes heavy and light such as rabbit immunoglobulin sequences and a two step nested PCR recovery step is used to obtain the antibody sequence. Amplicons from each well are analyzed for recovery and size integrity. The resulting fragments are then digested with AluI to fingerprint the sequence clonality. Identical sequences display a common fragmentation pattern in their electrophoretic analysis. Significantly this common fragmentation pattern which proves cell clonality is generally observed even in the wells originally plated up to 1000 cells well. The original heavy and light chain amplicon fragments are then restriction enzyme digested with HindIII and XhoI or HindIII and BsiWI to prepare the respective pieces of DNA for cloning. The resulting digestions are then ligated into an expression vector and transformed into bacteria for plasmid propagation and production. Colonies are selected for sequence characterization.

Correct full length antibody sequences for each well containing a single monoclonal antibody is established and miniprep DNA is prepared using Qiagen solid phase methodology. This DNA is then used to transfect mammalian cells to produce recombinant full length antibody. Crude antibody product is tested for antigen recognition and functional properties to confirm the original characteristics are found in the recombinant antibody protein. Where appropriate large scale transient mammalian transfections are completed and antibody is purified through Protein A affinity chromatography. Kd is assessed using standard methods e.g. Biacore as well as IC50 in a potency assay.

By using the antibody selection protocol described herein one can generate an extensive panel of antibodies. The antibodies have high affinity towards IL 6 single to double digit pM Kd and demonstrate potent antagonism of IL 6 in multiple cell based screening systems T1165 and HepG2 . Furthermore the collection of antibodies displays distinct modes of antagonism toward IL 6 driven processes.

Rabbits were immunized with huIL 6 R R . Immunization consisted of a first subcutaneous sc injection of 100 g in complete Freund s adjuvant CFA Sigma followed by two boosts two weeks apart of 50 g each in incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA Sigma . Animals were bled on day 55 and serum titers were determined by ELISA antigen recognition and by non radioactive proliferation assay Promega using the T1165 cell line.

Antigen recognition was determined by coating Immulon 4 plates Thermo with 1 g ml of huIL 6 50 l well in phosphate buffered saline PBS Hyclone overnight at 4 C. On the day of the assay plates were washed 3 times with PBS Tween 20 PBST tablets Calbiochem . Plates were then blocked with 200 l well of 0.5 fish skin gelatin FSG Sigma in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 C. Blocking solution was removed and plates were blotted. Serum samples were made bleeds and pre bleeds at a starting dilution of 1 100 all dilutions were made in FSG 50 l well followed by 1 10 dilutions across the plate column 12 was left blank for background control . Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS Tween 20. Goat anti rabbit FC HRP Pierce diluted 1 5000 was added to all wells 50 l well and plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. Plates were washed as described above. 50 l well of TMB Stable stop Fitzgerald Industries was added to plates and color was allowed to develop generally for 3 to 5 minutes. The development reaction was stopped with 50 l well 0.5 M HCl. Plates were read at 450 nm. Optical density OD versus dilution was plotted using Graph Pad Prizm software and titers were determined.

The functional activity of the samples was determined by a T1165 proliferation assay. T1165 cells were routinely maintained in modified RPMI medium Hyclone supplemented with HEPES sodium pyruvate sodium bicarbonate L glutamine high glucose penicillin streptomycin 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS all supplements from Hyclone 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma and 10 ng ml of huIL 6 R D . On the day of the assay cell viability was determined by trypan blue Invitrogen and cells were seeded at a fixed density of 20 000 cells well. Prior to seeding cells were washed twice in the medium described above without human IL 6 by centrifuging at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes and discarding the supernatant . After the last wash cells were resuspended in the same medium used for washing in a volume equivalent to 50 l well. Cells were set aside at room temperature.

In a round bottom 96 well plate Costar serum samples were added starting at 1 100 followed by a 1 10 dilution across the plate columns 2 to 10 at 30 l well in replicates of 5 rows B to F dilution made in the medium described above with no huIL 6 . Column 11 was medium only for IL 6 control. 30 l well of huIL 6 at 4 concentration of the final EC50 concentration previously determined were added to all wells huIL 6 was diluted in the medium described above . Wells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. to allow antibody binding to occur. After 1 hour 50 l well of antibody antigen Ab Ag complex were transferred to a flat bottom 96 well plate Costar following the plate map format laid out in the round bottom plate. On Row G 50 l well of medium were added to all wells columns 2 to 11 for background control. 50 l well of the cell suspension set aside were added to all wells columns 2 to 11 rows B to G . On Columns 1 and 12 and on rows A and H 200 l well of medium was added to prevent evaporation of test wells and to minimize edge effect. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 C. in 4 CO. At 72 h 20 l well of CellTiter96 Promega reagents was added to all test wells per manufacturer protocol and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 C. At 2 h plates were gently mixed on an orbital shaker to disperse cells and to allow homogeneity in the test wells. Plates were read at 490 nm wavelength. Optical density OD versus dilution was plotted using Graph Pad Prizm software and functional titer was determined. A positive assay control plate was conducted as described above using MAB2061 R D Systems at a starting concentration of 1 g ml final concentration followed by 1 3 dilutions across the plate.

Once acceptable titers were established the rabbit s were sacrificed. Spleen lymph nodes and whole blood were harvested and processed as follows 

Spleen and lymph nodes were processed into a single cell suspension by disassociating the tissue and pushing through sterile wire mesh at 70 m Fisher with a plunger of a 20 cc syringe. Cells were collected in the modified RPMI medium described above without huIL 6 but with low glucose. Cells were washed twice by centrifugation. After the last wash cell density was determined by trypan blue. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes the supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended in the appropriate volume of 10 dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO Sigma in FBS Hyclone and dispensed at 1 ml vial. Vials were then stored at 70 C. for 24 h prior to being placed in a liquid nitrogen LN2 tank for long term storage.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were isolated by mixing whole blood with equal parts of the low glucose medium described above without FBS. 35 ml of the whole blood mixture was carefully layered onto 8 ml of Lympholyte Rabbit Cedarlane into a 45 ml conical tube Corning and centrifuged 30 minutes at 2500 rpm at room temperature without brakes. After centrifugation the PBMC layers were carefully removed using a glass Pasteur pipette VWR combined and placed into a clean 50 ml vial. Cells were washed twice with the modified medium described above by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature and cell density was determined by trypan blue staining. After the last wash cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of 10 DMSO FBS medium and frozen as described above.

On the day of setting up B cell culture PBMC splenocyte or lymph node vials were thawed for use. Vials were removed from LN2 tank and placed in a 37 C. water bath until thawed. Contents of vials were transferred into 15 ml conical centrifuge tube Corning and 10 ml of modified RPMI described above was slowly added to the tube. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1.5K rpm and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of fresh media. Cell density and viability was determined by trypan blue. Cells were washed again and resuspended at 1E07 cells 80 L medium. Biotinylated huIL 6 B huIL 6 was added to the cell suspension at the final concentration of 3 g mL and incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C. Unbound B huIL 6 was removed with two 10 ml washes of phosphate buffered PBF Ca Mg free PBS Hyclone 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA 0.5 bovine serum albumin BSA Sigma biotin free . After the second wash cells were resuspended at 1E07 cells 80 L PBF. 20 L of MACS streptavidin beads Milteni 10E7 cells were added to the cell suspension. Cells were incubated at 4 C. for 15 minutes. Cells were washed once with 2 ml of PBF 10E7 cells. After washing the cells were resuspended at 1E08 cells 500 L of PBF and set aside. A MACS MS column Milteni was pre rinsed with 500 ml of PBF on a magnetic stand Milteni . Cell suspension was applied to the column through a pre filter and unbound fraction was collected. The column was washed with 1.5 ml of PBF buffer. The column was removed from the magnet stand and placed onto a clean sterile 5 ml Polypropylene Falcon tube. 1 ml of PBF buffer was added to the top of the column and positive selected cells were collected. The yield and viability of positive and negative cell fraction was determined by trypan blue staining. Positive selection yielded an average of 1 of the starting cell concentration.

A pilot cell screen was established to provide information on seeding levels for the culture. Three 10 plate groups a total of 30 plates were seeded at 50 100 and 200 enriched B cells well. In addition each well contained 50K cells well of irradiated EL 4.B5 cells 5 000 Rads and an appropriate level of T cell supernatant ranging from 1 5 depending on preparation in high glucose modified RPMI medium at a final volume of 250 L well. Cultures were incubated for 5 to 7 days at 37 C. in 4 CO.

The ELISA format used is as described above except 50 L of supernatant from the B cell cultures BCC wells all 30 plates was used as the source of the antibody. The conditioned medium was transferred to antigen coated plates. After positive wells were identified the supernatant was removed and transferred to a 96 well master plate s . The original culture plates were then frozen by removing all the supernatant except 40 L well and adding 60 L well of 16 DMSO in FBS. Plates were wrapped in paper towels to slow freezing and placed at 70 C.

Master plates were then screened for functional activity in the T1165 proliferation assay as described before except row B was media only for background control row C was media IL 6 for positive proliferation control and rows D G and columns 2 11 were the wells from the BCC 50 L well single points . 40 L of IL 6 was added to all wells except the media row at 2.5 times the EC50 concentration determined for the assay. After 1 h incubation the Ab Ag complex was transferred to a tissue culture TC treated 96 well flat bottom plate. 20 L of cell suspension in modified RPMI medium without huIL 6 T1165 at 20 000 cells well was added to all wells 100 L final volume per well . Background was subtracted and observed OD values were transformed into of inhibition.

Plates containing wells of interest were removed from 70 C. and the cells from each well were recovered with 5 200 L washes of medium well. The washes were pooled in a 1.5 ml sterile centrifuge tube and cells were pelleted for 2 minutes at 1500 rpm.

The tube was inverted the spin repeated and the supernatant carefully removed. Cells were resuspended in 100 L tube of medium. 100 L biotinylated IL 6 coated streptavidin M280 dynabeads Invitrogen and 16 L of goat anti rabbit H L IgG FITC diluted 1 100 in medium was added to the cell suspension.

20 L of cell beads FITC suspension was removed and 5 L droplets were prepared on a glass slide Corning previously treated with Sigmacote Sigma 35 to 40 droplets slide. An impermeable barrier of paraffin oil JT Baker was added to submerge the droplets and the slide was incubated for 90 minutes at 37 C. 4 COin the dark.

Specific B cells that produce antibody can be identified by the fluorescent ring around them due to antibody secretion recognition of the bead associated biotinylated antigen and subsequent detection by the fluorescent IgG detection reagent. Once a cell of interest was identified the cell in the center of the fluorescent ring was recovered via a micromanipulator Eppendorf . The single cell synthesizing and exporting the antibody was transferred into a 250 L microcentrifuge tube and placed in dry ice. After recovering all cells of interest these were transferred to 70 C. for long term storage.

Genes were cloned and constructed that directed the synthesis of a chimeric humanized rabbit monoclonal antibody.

The vector contains the following functional components 1 a mutant ColE1 origin of replication which facilitates the replication of the plasmid vector in cells of the bacterium 2 a bacterial Sh ble gene which confers resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin phleomycin and serves as the selectable marker for transformations of both and 3 an expression cassette composed of the glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase gene GAP gene promoter fused to sequences encoding the alpha mating factor pre pro secretion leader sequence followed by sequences encoding a transcriptional termination signal from the alcohol oxidase I gene AOXI . The Zeocin phleomycin resistance marker gene provides a means of enrichment for strains that contain multiple integrated copies of an expression vector in a strain by selecting for transformants that are resistant to higher levels of Zeocin phleomycin .

The second is that it is easy to monitor the sexual state of these strains since diploid Ade colonies arising from their mating are a normal white or cream color whereas cells of any strains that are haploid ade1 mutants will form a colony with a distinct pink color. In addition any strains that are haploid ura3 mutants are resistant to the drug 5 fluoro orotic acid FOA and can be sensitively identified by plating samples of a culture on minimal medium uracil plates with FOA. On these plates only uracil requiring ura3 mutant presumably haploid strains can grow and form colonies. Thus with haploid parent strains marked with ade1 and ura3 one can readily monitor the sexual state of the resulting antibody producing diploid strains haploid versus diploid .

Construction of pGAPZ alpha Expression Vectors for Transcription of Light and Heavy Chain Antibody Genes.

The humanized light and heavy chain fragments were cloned into the pGAPZ expression vectors through a PCR directed process. The recovered humanized constructs were subjected to amplification under standard KOD polymerase Novagen kit conditions 1 94 C. 2 minutes 2 94 C. 30 seconds 3 55 C. 30 seconds 4 72 C. 30 seconds cycling through steps 2 4 for 35 times 5 72 C. 2 minutes employing the following primers 1 light chain forward AGCGCTTATTCCGCTATCCAGATGACCCAGTC SEQ ID NO 741 the AfeI site is single underlined. The end of the HSA signal sequence is double underlined followed by the sequence for the mature variable light chain not underlined the reverse CGTACGTTTGATTTCCACCTTG SEQ ID NO 742 .

Variable light chain reverse primer. BsiWI site is underlined followed by the reverse complement for the 3 end of the variable light chain. Upon restriction enzyme digest with AfeI and BsiWI this enable insertion in frame with the pGAPZ vector using the human HAS leader sequence in frame with the human kappa light chain constant region for export. 2 A similar strategy is performed for the heavy chain. The forward primer employed is AGCGCTTATTCCGAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTC SEQ ID NO 743 . The AfeI site is single underlined. The end of the HSA signal sequence is double underlined followed by the sequence for the mature variable heavy chain not underlined . The reverse heavy chain primer is CTCGAGACGGTGACGAGGGT SEQ ID NO 744 . The XhoI site is underlined followed by the reverse complement for the 3 end of the variable heavy chain. This enables cloning of the heavy chain in frame with IgG 1 CH1 CH2 CH3 region previous inserted within pGAPZ using a comparable directional cloning strategy.

All methods used for transformation of haploid strains and genetic manipulation of the sexual cycle are as described in Higgins D. R. and Cregg J. M. Eds. 1998. . Humana Press Totowa N.J.

Prior to transformation each expression vector is linearized within the GAP promoter sequences with AvrII to direct the integration of the vectors into the GAP promoter locus of the genome. Samples of each vector are then individually transformed into electrocompetent cultures of the ade1 ura3 met1 and lys3 strains by electroporation and successful transformants are selected on YPD Zeocin phleomycin plates by their resistance to this antibiotic. Resulting colonies are selected streaked for single colonies on YPD Zeocin phleomycin plates and then examined for the presence of the antibody gene insert by a PCR assay on genomic DNA extracted from each strain for the proper antibody gene insert and or by the ability of each strain to synthesize an antibody chain by a colony lift immunoblot method Wung et al. Biotechniques 21 808 812 1996 . Haploid ade1 met1 and lys3 strains expressing one of the three heavy chain constructs are collected for diploid constructions along with haploid ura3 strain expressing light chain gene. The haploid expressing heavy chain genes are mated with the appropriate light chain haploid ura3 to generate diploid secreting protein.

Mating of haploid strains synthesizing a single antibody chain and selection of diploid derivatives synthesizing tetrameric functional antibodies. To mate haploid strains each add 1 or met1 or lys3 heavy chain producing strain to be crossed is streaked across a rich YPD plate and the ura3 light chain producing strain is streaked across a second YPD plate 10 streaks per plate . After one or two days incubation at 30 C. cells from one plate containing heavy chain strains and one plate containing ura3 light chain strains are transferred to a sterile velvet cloth on a replica plating block in a cross hatched pattern so that each heavy chain strain contain a patch of cells mixed with each light chain strain. The cross streaked replica plated cells are then transferred to a mating plate and incubated at 25 C. to stimulate the initiation of mating between strains. After two days the cells on the mating plates are transferred again to a sterile velvet on a replica plating block and then transferred to minimal medium plates. These plates are incubated at 30 C. for three days to allow for the selective growth of colonies of prototrophic diploid strains. Colonies that arose are picked and streaked onto a second minimal medium plate to single colony isolate and purify each diploid strain. The resulting diploid cell lines are then examined for antibody production.

Putative diploid strains are tested to demonstrate that they are diploid and contain both expression vectors for antibody production. For diploidy samples of a strain are spread on mating plates to stimulate them to go through meiosis and form spores. Haploid spore products are collected and tested for phenotype. If a significant percentage of the resulting spore products are single or double auxotrophs it may be concluded that the original strain must have been diploid. Diploid strains are examined for the presence of both antibody genes by extracting genomic DNA from each and utilizing this DNA in PCR reactions specific for each gene.

Fusion of haploid strains synthesizing a single antibody chain and selection of diploid derivatives synthesizing tetrameric functional antibodies. As an alternative to the mating procedure described above individual cultures of single chain antibody producing haploid ade1 and ura3 strains are spheroplasted and their resulting spheroplasts fused using polyethylene glycol CaCl. The fused haploid strains are then embedded in agar containing 1 M sorbitol and minimal medium to allow diploid strains to regenerate their cell wall and grow into visible colonies. Resulting colonies are picked from the agar streaked onto a minimal medium plate and the plates are incubated for two days at 30 C. to generate colonies from single cells of diploid cell lines. The resulting putative diploid cell lines are then examined for diploidy and antibody production as described above.

Purification and analysis of antibodies. A diploid strain for the production of full length antibody is derived through the mating of met1 light chain and lys3 heavy chain using the methods described above. Culture media from shake flask or fermenter cultures of diploid expression strains are collected and examined for the presence of antibody protein via SDS PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies directed against heavy and light chains of human IgG or specifically against the heavy chain of IgG.

To purify the yeast secreted antibodies clarified media from antibody producing cultures are passed through a protein A column and after washing with 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 binding buffer protein A bound protein is eluted using 0.1 M glycine HCl buffer pH 3.0. Fractions containing the most total protein are examined by Coomasie blue strained SDS PAGE and immunoblotting for antibody protein. Antibody is characterized using the ELISA described above for IL 6 recognition.

The recombinant yeast derived humanized antibody is evaluated for functional activity through the IL 6 driven T1165 cell proliferation assay and IL 6 stimulated HepG2 haptoglobin assay described above.

Human IL 6 can provoke an acute phase response in rats and one of the major acute phase proteins that is stimulated in the rat is 2 macroglobulin A2M . A study was designed to assess the dose of antibody Ab1 required to ablate the A2M response to a single s.c. injection of 100 g of human IL 6 given one hour after different doses 0.03 0.1 0.3 1 and 3 mg kg of antibody Ab1 administered intravenously n 10 rats dose level or polyclonal human IgG1 as the control n 10 rats . Plasma was recovered and the A2M was quantitated via a commercial sandwich ELISA kit ICL Inc. Newberg Oreg. cat. no. E 25A2M . The endpoint was the difference in the plasma concentration of A2M at the 24 hour time point post Ab1 . The results are presented in .

The IC50 for antibody Ab1 was 0.1 mg kg with complete suppression of the A2M response at the 0.3 mg kg. This firmly establishes in vivo neutralization of human IL 6 can be accomplished by antibody Ab1.

The human renal cell cancer cell line RXF393 produces profound weight loss when transplanted into athymic nude mice. Weight loss begins around day 15 after transplantation with 80 of all animals losing at least 30 of their total body weight by day 18 20 after transplantation. RXF393 secretes human IL 6 and the plasma concentration of human IL 6 in these animals is very high at around 10 ng ml. Human IL 6 can bind murine soluble IL 6 receptor and activate IL 6 responses in the mouse. Human IL 6 is approximately 10 times less potent than murine IL 6 at activating IL 6 responses in the mouse. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of antibody Ab1 on survival body weight serum amyloid A protein hematology parameters and tumor growth in athymic nude mice transplanted with the human renal cell cancer cell line RXF393.

Eighty 6 week old male athymic nude mice were implanted with RXF393 tumor fragments 30 40 mg subcutaneously in the right flank. Animals were then divided into eight groups of ten mice. Three groups were given either antibody Ab1 at 3 mg kg 10 mg kg or 30 mg kg intravenously weekly on day 1 day 8 day 15 and day 22 after transplantation progression groups . Another three groups were given either antibody Ab1 at 3 mg kg or 10 mg kg or 30 mg kg intravenously weekly on day 8 day 15 and day 22 after transplantation regression groups . Finally one control group was given polyclonal human IgG 30 mg kg and a second control group was given phosphate buffered saline intravenously weekly on day 1 day 8 day 15 and day 22 after transplantation.

Animals were euthanized at either day 28 when the tumor reached 4 000 mmor if they became debilitated 30 loss of body weight . Animals were weighed on days 1 6 and then daily from days 9 to 28 after transplantation. Mean Percent Body Weight MPBW was used as the primary parameter to monitor weight loss during the study. It was calculated as follows Body Weight Tumor Weight Baseline Body Weight 100. Tumor weight was measured on days 1 6 9 12 15 18 22 25 and 28 after transplantation. Blood was taken under anesthesia from five mice in each group on days 5 and 13 and all ten mice in each group when euthanized day 28 in most cases . Blood was analyzed for hematology and serum amyloid A protein SAA concentration. An additional group of 10 non tumor bearing 6 week old athymic nude male mice had blood samples taken for hematology and SAA concentration estimation to act as a baseline set of values.

No animals were euthanized or died in any of the antibody Ab1 groups prior to the study termination date of day 28. In the two control groups 15 animals 7 9 in the polyclonal human IgG group and 8 10 in the phosphate buffered saline group were found dead or were euthanized because they were very debilitated 30 loss of body weight . Median survival time in both control groups was 20 days.

The survival curves for the two control groups and the antibody Ab1 progression dosed from day 1 of the study groups are presented in .

The survival curves for the two control groups and the antibody Ab1 regression dosed from day 8 of the study groups are presented in .

There was a statistically significant difference between the survival curves for the polyclonal human IgG p 0.0038 and phosphate buffered saline p 0.0003 control groups and the survival curve for the six antibody Ab1 groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two control groups p 0.97 .

Tumor size in surviving mice was estimated by palpation. For the first 15 days of the study none of the mice in any group were found dead or were euthanized and so comparison of tumor sizes between groups on these days was free from sampling bias. No difference in tumor size was observed between the antibody Ab1 progression or regression groups and the control groups through day 15. Comparison of the tumor size between surviving mice in the control and treatment groups subsequent to the onset of mortality in the controls on day 15 was not undertaken because tumor size the surviving control mice was presumed to be biased and accordingly the results of such comparison would not be meaningful.

As administration of antibody Ab1 promoted survival without any apparent reduction in tumor size elevated serum IL 6 may contribute to mortality through mechanisms independent of tumor growth. These observations supports the hypothesis that antibody Ab1 can promote cancer patient survivability without directly affecting tumor growth possibly by enhancing general patient well being.

Mean Percent Body Weight MPBW SEM versus time is shown in . Compared to controls mice dosed with Ab1 were protected from weight loss. On day 18 MPBW in control mice was 75 corresponding to an average weight loss of 25 . In contrast on the same day MPBW in Ab 1 treatment groups was minimally changed between 97 and 103 . There was a statistically significant difference between the MPBW curves for the controls receiving polyclonal human IgG or PBS and the 10 mg kg dosage group p

Representative photographs of control and Ab1 treated mice illustrate the emaciated condition of the control mice compared to the normal appearance of the Ab1 treated mouse at the end of the study note externally visible tumor sites in right flank .

These results suggest that Ab1 may be useful to prevent or treat cachexia caused by elevated IL 6 in humans.

The mean SEM plasma serum amyloid A concentration versus time for the two control groups and the antibody Ab1 progression dosed from day 1 of the study and regression dosed from day 8 of the study groups are presented in Table 5 and graphically in .

SAA is up regulated via the stimulation of hIL 6 and this response is directly correlated with circulating levels of hIL 6 derived from the implanted tumor. The surrogate marker provides an indirect readout for active hIL 6. Thus in the two treatment groups described above there are significantly decreased levels of SAA due to the neutralization of tumor derived hIL 6. This further supports the contention that antibody Ab1 displays in vivo efficacy.

A second study was performed in the RXF 393 cachexia model where treatment with antibody Ab1 was started at a later stage days 10 and 13 post transplantation and with a more prolonged treatment phase out to 49 days post transplantation . The dosing interval with antibody Ab1 was shortened to 3 days from 7 and also daily food consumption was measured. There was also an attempt to standardize the tumor sizes at the time of initiating dosing with antibody Ab1.

Eighty 6 week old male athymic nude mice were implanted with RXF393 tumor fragments 30 40 mg subcutaneously in the right flank. 20 mice were selected whose tumors had reached between 270 320 mg in size and divided into two groups. One group received antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days and the other group received polyclonal human IgG 10 mg kg every 3 days from that time point day 10 after transplantation . Another 20 mice were selected when their tumor size had reached 400 527 mg in size and divided into two groups. One group received antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days and the other group received polyclonal human IgG 10 mg kg every 3 days from that time point day 13 after transplantation . The remaining 40 mice took no further part in the study and were euthanized at either day 49 when the tumor reached 4 000 mmor if they became very debilitated 30 loss of body weight .

Animals were weighed every 3 4 days from day 1 to day 49 after transplantation. Mean Percent Body Weight MPBW was used as the primary parameter to monitor weight loss during the study. It was calculated as follows Body Weight Tumor Weight Baseline Body Weight 100. Tumor weight was measured every 3 4 days from day 5 to day 49 after transplantation. Food consumption was measured amount consumed in 24 hours by weight g by each treatment group every day from day 10 for the 270 320 mg tumor groups and day 13 for the 400 527 mg tumor groups.

The survival curves for antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 270 320 mg tumor size and for the polyclonal human IgG 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 270 320 mg tumor size are presented in .

Median survival for the antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 270 320 mg tumor size was 46 days and for the polyclonal human IgG at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 270 320 mg tumor size was 32.5 days p 0.0071 .

The survival curves for the antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 400 527 mg tumor size and for the polyclonal human IgG at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 400 527 mg tumor size are presented in . Median survival for the antibody Ab1 at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 400 527 mg tumor size was 46.5 days and for the polyclonal human IgG at 10 mg kg i.v. every three days 400 527 mg tumor size was 27 days p 0.0481 .

Antibody Ab1 was dosed in a single bolus infusion to a single male and single female cynomologus monkey in phosphate buffered saline. Plasma samples were removed at fixed time intervals and the level of antibody Ab1 was quantitated through of the use of an antigen capture ELISA assay. Biotinylated IL 6 50 l of 3 g mL was captured on Streptavidin coated 96 well microtiter plates. The plates were washed and blocked with 0.5 Fish skin gelatin. Appropriately diluted plasma samples were added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatants removed and an anti hFc HRP conjugated secondary antibody applied and left at room temperature.

The plates were then aspirated and TMB added to visualize the amount of antibody. The specific levels were then determined through the use of a standard curve. A second dose of antibody Ab1 was administered at day 35 to the same two cynomologus monkeys and the experiment replicated using an identical sampling plan. The resulting concentrations are then plot vs. time as show in .

This humanized full length aglycosylated antibody expressed and purified displays comparable characteristics to mammalian expressed protein. In addition multiple doses of this product display reproducible half lives inferring that this production platform does not generate products that display enhanced immunogenicity.

IL 6 signaling is dependent upon interactions between IL 6 and two receptors IL 6R1 CD126 and gp130 IL 6 signal transducer . To determine the antibody mechanism of action mechanistic studies were performed using bio layer interferometry with an Octet QK instrument ForteBio Menlo Park Calif. . Studies were performed in two different configurations. In the first orientation biotinylated IL 6 R D systems part number 206 IL 001MG CF biotinylated using Pierce EZ link sulfo NHS LC LC biotin product number 21338 according to manufacturer s protocols was initially bound to a streptavidin coated biosensor ForteBio part number 18 5006 . Binding is monitored as an increase in signal.

The IL 6 bound to the sensor was then incubated either with the antibody in question or diluent solution alone. The sensor was then incubated with soluble IL 6R1 R D systems product number 227 SR 025 CF molecule. If the IL 6R1 molecule failed to bind the antibody was deemed to block IL 6 IL 6R1 interactions. These complexes were incubated with gp130 R D systems 228 GP 010 CF in the presence of IL 6R1 for stability purposes. If gp130 did not bind it was concluded that the antibody blocked gp130 interactions with IL 6.

In the second orientation the antibody was bound to a biosensor coated with an anti human IgG1 Fc specific reagent ForteBio part number 18 5001 . The IL 6 was bound to the immobilized antibody and the sensor was incubated with IL 6R1. If the IL 6R1 did not interact with the IL 6 then it was concluded that the IL 6 binding antibody blocked IL 6 IL 6R1 interactions. In those situations where antibody IL 6 IL 6R1 was observed the complex was incubated with gp130 in the presence of IL 6R1. If gp130 did not interact then it was concluded that the antibody blocked IL 6 gp130 interactions. All studies were performed in a 200 L final volume at 30 C and 1000 rpm. For these studies all proteins were diluted using ForteBio s sample diluent buffer part number 18 5028 .

In order to determine the epitope recognized by Ab1 on human IL 6 the antibody was employed in a western blot based assay. The form of human IL 6 utilized in this example had a sequence of 183 amino acids in length shown below . A 57 member library of overlapping 15 amino acid peptides encompassing this sequence was commercially synthesized and covalently bound to a PepSpots nitrocellulose membrane JPT Peptide technologies Berlin Germany . The sequences of the overlapping 15 amino acid peptides are shown in . Blots were prepared and probed according to the manufacturer s recommendations.

Briefly blots were pre wet in methanol rinsed in PBS and blocked for over 2 hours in 10 non fat milk in PBS 0.05 Tween Blocking Solution . The Ab1 antibody was used at 1 mg ml final dilution and the HRP conjugated Mouse Anti Human Kappa secondary antibody Southern BioTech 9220 05 was used at a 1 5000 dilution. Antibody dilutions incubations were performed in blocking solution. Blots were developed using Amersham ECL advance reagents GE RPN2135 and chemiluminescent signal documented using a CCD camera Alphalnnotec . The results of the blots are shown in and .

Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure association rate K dissociation rate K and dissociation constant K for Ab1 to IL 6 from rat mouse dog human and cynomolgus monkey at 25 C. . The dissociation constant for human IL 6 was 4 pM indicating very high affinity. As expected affinity generally decreased with phylogenetic distance from human. The dissociation constants of Ab1 for IL 6 of cynomolgus monkey rat and mouse were 31 pM 1.4 nM and 0.4 nM respectively. Ab1 affinity for dog IL 6 below the limit of quantitation of the experiment.

The high affinity of Ab1 for mouse rat and cynomolgus monkey IL 6 suggest that Ab1 may be used to inhibit IL 6 of these species. This hypothesis was tested using a cell proliferation assay. In brief each species s IL 6 was used to stimulate proliferation of T1165 cells and the concentration at which Ab1 could inhibit 50 of proliferation IC50 was measured. Inhibition was consistent with the measured dissociation constants . These results demonstrate that Ab1 can inhibit the native IL 6 of these species and suggest the use of these organisms for in vitro or in vivo modeling of IL 6 inhibition by Ab1.

Antibody Ab1 was dosed in a single bolus infusion in histidine and sorbitol to healthy human volunteers. Dosages of 1 mg 3 mg 10 mg 30 mg or 100 mg were administered to each individual in dosage groups containing five to six individuals. Plasma samples were removed at fixed time intervals for up to twelve weeks. Human plasma was collected via venipuncture into a vacuum collection tube containing EDTA. Plasma was separated and used to assess the circulating levels of Ab1 using a monoclonal antibody specific for Ab1 as follows. A 96 well microtiter plate was coated overnight with the monoclonal antibody specific for Ab1 in 1 PBS overnight at 4 C. The remaining steps were conducted at room temperature. The wells were aspirated and subsequently blocked using 0.5 Fish Skin Gelatin FSG Sigma in 1 PBS for 60 minutes. Human plasma samples were then added and incubated for 60 minutes then aspirated then 50 L of 1 g mL biotinylated IL 6 was then added to each well and incubated for 60 minutes. The wells were aspirated and 50 L streptavidin HRP Pharmingen diluted 1 5 000 in 0.5 FSG PBS was added and incubated for 45 minutes. Development was conducted using standard methods employing TMB for detection. Levels were then determined via comparison to a standard curve prepared in a comparable format.

Average plasma concentration of Ab1 for each dosage group versus time is shown in . Mean AUC and Cincreased linearly with dosage and respectively . For dosages of 30 mg and above the average Ab1 half life in each dosage group was between approximately 25 and 30 days .

Antibody Ab1 was dosed in a single bolus infusion in phosphate buffered saline to five individuals with advanced cancer. Each individual received a dosage of 80 mg n 2 or 160 mg n 3 of Ab1. Plasma samples were drawn weekly and the level of antibody Ab1 was quantitated as in Example 16.

Average plasma concentration of Ab1 in these individuals as a function of time is shown in . The average Ab1 half life was approximately 31 days.

Overall the average half life of Ab1 was approximately 31 days in humans for dosages of 10 mg and above and approximately 15 21 days in cynomolgus monkey. The Ab1 half life in humans and cynomolgus monkeys is unprecedented when compared with the half lives of other anti IL 6 antibodies . As described above Ab1 was derived from humanization of a rabbit antibody and is produced from in an aglycosylated form. These characteristics results in an antibody with very low immunogenicity in humans. Moreover the lack of glycosylation prevents Ab1 from interacting with the Fc receptor or complement. Without intent to be limited by theory it is believed that the unprecedented half life of Ab1 is at least partially attributable to the humanization and lack of glycosylation. The particular sequence and or structure of the antigen binding surfaces may also contribute to Ab1 s half life.

Antibody Ab1 was dosed in a single bolus infusion in phosphate buffered saline to eight individuals with advanced cancer NSCLC colorectal cancer cholangiocarcinoma or mesothelioma . Each individual received a dosage of 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg of Ab1. Blood samples were removed just prior to infusion and at fixed time intervals for six weeks and the hemoglobin concentration plasma lipid concentration and neutrophil counts were determined. Average hemoglobin concentration rose slightly as did total cholesterol and triglycerides while mean neutrophil counts fell slightly .

These results further demonstrate some of the beneficial effects of administration of Ab1 to chronically ill individuals. Because IL 6 is the main cytokine responsible for the anemia of chronic disease including cancer related anemia neutralization of IL 6 by Ab1 increases hemoglobin concentration in these individuals. Similarly as IL 6 is centrally important in increasing neutrophil counts in inflammation the observed slight reduction in neutrophil counts further confirms that Ab1 inhibits IL 6. Finally IL 6 causes anorexia as well as cachexia in these patients neutralization of IL 6 by Ab1 results in the return of appetite and reversal of cachexia. The increase in plasma lipid concentrations reflects the improved nutritional status of the patients. Taken together these results further demonstrate that Ab1 effectively reverses these adverse consequences of IL 6 in these patients.

Serum CRP concentrations have been identified as a strong prognostic indicator in patients with certain forms of cancer. For example Hashimoto et al. performed univariate and multivariate analysis of preoperative serum CRP concentrations in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in order to identify factors affecting survival and disease recurrence Hashimoto K. et al. Cancer 103 9 1856 1864 2005 . Patients were classified into two groups those with serum CRP levels 1.0 mg dL the CRP positive group and those with serum CRP levels 

Similar correlations have been identified by other investigators. For example Karakiewicz et al. determined that serum CRP was an independent and informative predictor of renal cell carcinoma specific mortality Karakiewicz P. I. et al. Cancer 110 6 1241 1247 2007 . Accordingly there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments that reduce serum C Reactive Protein CRP concentrations in cancer patients and particularly those with advanced cancers.

Healthy volunteers received a single 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either 100 mg 5 patients 30 mg 5 patients 10 mg 6 patients 3 mg 6 patients or 1 mg 6 patients of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody while another 14 healthy volunteers received intravenous placebo. Comparatively 2 patients with advanced forms of colorectal cancer received a single 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of 80 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population.

Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage and thereafter on a weekly basis for at least 5 weeks post dose. At the time of each evaluation patients were screened for serum CRP concentration.

As noted above serum CRP levels are a marker of inflammation accordingly baseline CRP levels are typically low in healthy individuals. The low baseline CRP levels can make a further reduction in CRP levels difficult to detect. Nonetheless a substantial reduction in serum CRP concentrations was detectable in healthy volunteers receiving all concentrations of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody compared to controls . The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid occurring within one week of antibody administration and prolonged continuing at least through the final measurement was taken 8 or 12 weeks from antibody administration .

Five advanced cancer patients colorectal cancer cholangiocarcinoma or NSCLC having elevated serum CRP levels were dosed with 80 mg or 160 mg of Ab1. Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in these patients . The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid with 90 of the decrease occurring within one week of Ab1 administration and prolonged continuing at least until the final measurement was taken up to twelve weeks . The CRP levels of two representative individuals are shown in . In those individuals the CRP levels were lowered to below the normal reference range less than 5 6 mg l within one week. Thus administration of Ab1 to advanced cancer patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels.

Weight loss and fatigue and accompanying muscular weakness are very common symptoms of patients with advanced forms of cancer and these symptoms can worsen as the cancer continues to progress. Fatigue weight loss and muscular weakness can have significant negative effects on the recovery of patients with advanced forms of cancer for example by disrupting lifestyles and relationships and affecting the willingness or ability of patients to continue cancer treatments. Known methods of addressing fatigue weight loss and muscular weakness include regular routines of fitness and exercise methods of conserving the patient s energy and treatments that address anemia induced fatigue and muscular weakness. Nevertheless there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments that improve fatigue weight loss and muscular weakness in cancer patients.

Four patients with advanced forms of cancer colorectal cancer 2 NSCLC 1 cholangiocarcinoma 1 received a single 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either 80 mg or 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population.

Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage and thereafter for at least 6 weeks post dose. At the time of each evaluation patients were screened for the following a. any change in weight b. fatigue as measured using the Facit F Fatigue Subscale questionnaire a medically recognized test for evaluating fatigue See e.g. Cella D. Lai J. S. Chang C. H. Peterman A. Slavin M. 2002 . Fatigue in cancer patients compared with fatigue in the general population. Cancer 94 2 528 538 Cella D. Eton D. T. Lai F J S. Peterman A.

The averaged data for both dosage concentrations 80 mg and 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated an increase of about 2 kilograms of weight per patient over the period of 6 weeks .

The averaged data for both dosage concentrations 80 mg and 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated an increase in the mean Facit F FS subscale score of at least about 10 points in the patient population over the period of 6 weeks .

The averaged data for both dosage concentrations 80 mg and 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated an increase in the mean hand grip strength of at least about 10 percent in the patient population over the period of 6 weeks .

Prior studies have shown that administration of an anti IL 6 antibody can cause decreased platelet counts. Emilie D. et al. Blood 84 8 2472 9 1994 Blay et al. Int J Cancer 72 3 424 30 1997 . These results have apparently been viewed as an indicator of potential danger because further decreases in platelet counts could cause complications such as bleeding. However Applicants have now discerned that inhibiting IL 6 restores a normal coagulation profile which Applicants predict will prevent thrombosis. Decreased platelet counts resulting from inhibition of IL 6 is not a sign of potential danger but rather reflects the beneficial restoration of normal coagulation.

The mechanism by which normal coagulation is restored is believed to result from the interplay between IL 6 and the acute phase reaction. In response to elevated IL 6 levels as for example in a cancer patient the liver produces acute phase proteins. These acute phase proteins include coagulation factors such as Factor II Factor V Factor VIII Factor IX Factor XI Factor XII F fibrin degradation products thrombin antithrombin III complex fibrinogen plasminogen prothrombin and von Willebrand factor. This increase in coagulation factors may be measured directly or may be inferred from functional measurements of clotting ability. Antagonists of IL 6 such as Ab1 suppresses acute phase proteins e.g. Serum Amyloid A see and Example 10 . Applicants now predict that this suppression of acute phase proteins will restore the normal coagulation profile and thereby prevent thrombosis. The restoration of normal coagulation may cause a slight drop in platelet counts but the patient will nonetheless retain normal coagulation ability and thus will not have an increased risk of bleeding. Such a treatment will represent a vast improvement over the available anticoagulation therapies whose usefulness is limited by the risk of adverse side effects such as major bleeding.

Applicants contemplate that the same beneficial effects of inhibiting IL 6 will be obtained regardless of the method of inhibition. Suitable methods of inhibiting IL 6 include administration of anti IL 6 antibodies antisense therapy soluble IL 6 receptor etc. either individually or in combinations.

Serum albumin concentrations are recognized as predictive indicators of survival and or recovery success of cancer patients. Hypoalbumenia correlates strongly with poor patient performance in numerous forms of cancer. For example in one study no patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and having serum albumin levels less than 3.5 g dL successfully responded to systemic chemotherapy Fujishiro M. et al. Hepatogastroenterology 47 36 1744 46 2000 . The authors conclude that p atients with . . . hypoalbuminemia . . . might be inappropriate candidates for systemic chemotherapy and might be treated with other experimental approaches or supportive care. Id.

Similarly Senior and Maroni state that t he recent appreciation that hypoalbuminemia is the most powerful predictor of mortality in end stage renal disease highlights the critical importance of ensuring adequate protein intake in this patient population. J. R. Senior and B. J. Maroni Am. Soc. Nutr. Sci. 129 313 S 314S 1999 .

In at least one study attempts to rectify hypoalbuminemia in 27 patients with metastatic cancer by daily intravenous albumin infusion of 20 g until normal serum albumin levels 3.5 g dL were achieved had little success. The authors note that a lbumin infusion for the advanced stage cancer patients has limited value in clinical practice. Patients with PS 4 and hypoalbuminemia have poorer prognosis. Demirkazik A. et al. Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 21 Abstr 2892 2002 .

Accordingly there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments that improve serum albumin concentrations in cancer patients and address hypoalbuminemic states in cancer patients particularly those with advanced cancers.

Four patients with advanced forms of cancer colorectal cancer 2 NSCLC 1 cholangiocarcinoma 1 received a single 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either 80 mg or 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population.

Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage and thereafter for at least 6 weeks post dose. At the time of each evaluation patients were screened for plasma albumin concentration.

The averaged data for both dosage concentrations 80 mg and 160 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated an increase of about 5 g L of plasma albumin concentration per patient over the period of 6 weeks .

Serum CRP concentrations have been identified as a strong prognostic indicator in patients with certain forms of cancer. For example Hashimoto et al. performed univariate and multivariate analysis of preoperative serum CRP concentrations in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in order to identify factors affecting survival and disease recurrence Hashimoto K. et al. Cancer 103 9 1856 1864 2005 . Patients were classified into two groups those with serum CRP levels 1.0 mg dL the CRP positive group and those with serum CRP levels

For example Karakiewicz et al. determined that serum CRP was an independent and informative predictor of renal cell carcinoma specific mortality Karakiewicz P. I. et al. Cancer 110 6 1241 1247 2007 . Accordingly there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments that reduce serum C Reactive Protein CRP concentrations in cancer patients and particularly those with advanced cancers.

One hundred twenty four patients with non small cell lung cancer NSCLC were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either placebo n 31 80 mg n 29 160 mg n 32 or 320 mg n 32 of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody every 8 weeks over a 24 week duration for a total of 3 doses. CRP concentration was quantitated by a C reactive protein particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay using latex attached anti CRP antibodies i.e. Roche CRP Tinaquant . Briefly about 1.0 mL of patient sample serum was collected and stored in a plastic collection tube. Sample was placed into appropriate buffer and anti CRP antibody coupled to latex microparticles was added to the sample to start the reaction. These anti CRP antibodies with conjugated latex microparticles react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen antibody complex. Following agglutination this was measured turbidimetrically using a Roche Hitachi Modular P analizer.

Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage and thereafter at weeks 2 4 8 and 12. At the time of each evaluation patients were screened for serum CRP concentration.

The averaged data for each dosage concentrations placebo 80 mg 160 mg and 320 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody are plotted in . All dosage levels of Ab1 antibody demonstrated an immediate drop in CRP concentrations relative to placebo over the period of 12 weeks. CRP levels displayed breakthrough at 8 weeks post dosing. The CRP levels fell below 5 mg L by week 12. Median values of CRP demonstrated rapid and sustained decreases for all dosage concentrations relative to placebo . Thus administration of Ab1 to advanced cancer patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels.

Eight patients with various forms of advanced cancer colorectal 3 NSCLC 1 cholangio 1 and mesothelioma 2 received a single 1 hour intravenous infusion of either 80 mg 2 patients 160 mg 3 patients or 320 mg 3 patients of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population.

Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in all patients studied . The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid with approximately 90 of the decrease occurring within one week of Ab1 administration and prolonged diminished levels continued at least until the final measurement was taken up to twelve weeks . In all cases except one patient with colorectal cancer CRP levels fell to at or below the normal reference range less than 5 6 mg L within one week. The colorectal cancer patient achieved similar normal levels by week 4 of the study. Thus administration of Ab1 to advanced cancer patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels.

Serum CRP concentrations have been identified as a strong prognostic indicator in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis with high levels of CRP demonstrated almost universal deterioration. Amos et al. 1 Br. Med. J. 195 97 1977 . Conversely patients with low CRP levels showed no disease progression suggesting that sustaining low levels of CRP is necessary for effectively treating rheumatoid arthritis. Id. Tracking of CRP during rheumatoid arthritis treatment regimes of gold D penicillamine chloroquine or dapsone indicated that radiological deterioration was impeded after the first 6 months of treatment when CRP levels were consistently controlled. Dawes et al. 25 Rheumatology 44 49 1986 . A highly significant correlation between CRP production and radiological progression was identified. van Leeuwen et al. 32 Supp. 3 Rheumatology 9 13 1997 . Another study revealed that for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis suppression of abnormally elevated CRP led to improvement in functional testing metrics whereas sustained CRP elevation associated with deterioration in the same metrics. Devlin et al. 24 J. Rheumatol. 9 13 1997 . No further deterioration was observed without CRP re elevation indicating CRP suppression as a viable candidate for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Id. Accordingly there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments that reduce serum C Reactive Protein CRP concentrations in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

One hundred twenty seven patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and CRP 10 mg L were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either placebo n 33 80 mg n 32 160 mg n 34 or 320 mg n 28 of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody once at the start of the 16 week trial and again at week 8. CRP concentration was quantitated by a C reactive protein particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay using latex attached anti CRP antibodies i.e. Roche CRP Tinaquant . Briefly about 1.0 mL of patient sample serum was collected and stored in a plastic collection tube. Sample was placed into appropriate buffer and anti CRP antibody coupled to latex microparticles was added to the sample to start the reaction. These anti CRP antibodies with conjugated latex microparticles react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen antibody complex. Following agglutination this was measured turbidimetrically using a Roche Hitachi Modular P analizer. Data on CRP concentration was collected every week for the first 4 weeks every two weeks between weeks 4 and 12 and at the conclusion of the test at week 16.

Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in all patients studied . The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid with immediate reduction in CRP levels relative to placebo within one week of Ab1 administration and prolonged diminished levels continued at least until the final measurement was taken up to sixteen weeks . In all cases CRP levels fell to at or below the normal reference range less than 5 6 mg L within one week. Thus administration of Ab1 to rheumatoid arthritis patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels and presents an effective treatment regime.

Antibody Ab1 was dosed at 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg of Ab1 in phosphate buffered saline to 93 individuals with non small cell lung carcinoma. The placebo group of 31 individuals with non small cell lung carcinoma was dosed with phosphate buffered saline only. Blood samples were removed just prior to dosing zero week and at two four eight and twelve weeks and the hemoglobin concentration was determined. Mean hemoglobin concentration rose for those receiving antibody Ab1 while mean hemoglobin concentration of those receiving placebo did not rise after twelve weeks when compared to the concentration just prior to dosing zero week .

A subset of the study population began the study with low levels of hemoglobin defined as a baseline hemoglobin concentration below 11 g l. Mean hemoglobin concentration rose above 11 g l after eight weeks for those receiving antibody Ab1 at dosages of 160 mg and 320 mg while mean hemoglobin concentration of those receiving antibody Ab1 at dosages of 80 mg or placebo did not rise above 11 g l after eight weeks .

These results further demonstrate some of the beneficial effects of administration of Ab1 to chronically ill individuals. Because IL 6 is the main cytokine responsible for the anemia of chronic disease including cancer related anemia neutralization of IL 6 by Ab1 increases hemoglobin concentration in these individuals.

Hemoglobin levels were analyzed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with Ab1 antibody. Ab1 antibody was dosed at 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg in phosphate buffered saline to 94 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The placebo group of 33 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis was dosed with phosphate buffered saline only. Blood samples were removed just prior to dosing zero week and at one two three four six eight ten twelve and sixteen weeks and the hemoglobin concentration was determined. Mean hemoglobin concentration rose for those receiving antibody Ab1 while mean hemoglobin concentration of those receiving placebo did not appreciably rise after sixteen weeks when compared to the concentration just prior to dosing zero week .

Because IL 6 is the main cytokine responsible for the anemia of chronic disease including cancer related anemia neutralization of IL 6 by Ab1 increases hemoglobin concentration.

The 80 mg dosage group demonstrated an initial increase but gradually declined after week 2 and never rose above 35 g L during the 8 weeks where data was available Id. .

Weight loss and fatigue are very common symptoms of patients with advanced forms of cancer and these symptoms can worsen as the cancer continues to progress. Fatigue and weight loss can have significant negative effects on the recovery of patients with advanced forms of cancer for example by disrupting lifestyles and relationships and affecting the willingness or ability of patients to continue cancer treatments.

D dimer concentrations are recognized as useful diagnostic tools in predicting risks of thrombotic events in patients. Adam et al. 113 Blood 2878 87 2009 Patients that are negative for D dimer have a low probability for thrombosis. For example D dimer analysis can rule out suspected lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in patients. Wells et al. 349 N. Engl. J. Med. 1227 35 2003 Clinical evaluation in combination with negative D dimer test can effectively lower the instance of pulmonary embolism to 0.5 . Van Belle et al. 295 JAMA 172 79 2006 Kruip et al. 162 Arch. Intern. Med. 1631 35 2002 Wells et al. 135 Ann. Intern. Med. 98 107 2001 

D dimer analysis may have utility in tracking the progress of treating coagulation disorders. One study indicated that anticoagulation treatment for acute venous thromboembolism resulted in a gradual decline in D dimer concentrations. Adam et al. 113 Blood 2878 87 2009 Schutgens et al. 144 J. Lab. Clin. Med. 100 07 2004 This discovery led to the conclusion that D dimer levels monitoring could be used to assess treatment responsiveness. Adam et al. 113 Blood at 2883 

For patients with cancer D dimer analysis may have additional significance as cancer increases the prevalence of thrombosis. Adam et al. 113 Blood 2878 87 2009 One study with oncology patients indicated that D dimer concentrations have a high negative predictive value and high sensitivity in diagnosing pulmonary embolism. King et al. 247 Radiology 854 61 2008 Deep vein thrombosis can similarly be excluded for cancer patients with low probability of developing deep vein thrombosis and a negative test for D dimer although such a combination is less likely for oncology patients. Lee et al. 123 Thromb. Res. 177 83 2008 A higher threshold for a negative D dimer result may be necessary in cancer patients. Righini et al. 95 Haemost. 715 19 2006 

Accordingly there remains a need in the art for methods and or treatments of thrombosis that improve D dimer concentrations in cancer patients and address elevated D dimer states in cancer patients particularly those with advanced cancers.

One hundred twenty four patients with non small cell lung cancer NSCLC were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either placebo n 31 80 mg n 29 160 mg n 32 or 320 mg n 32 of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody every 8 weeks over a 24 week duration for a total of 3 doses. Data on D dimer concentration was collected for the first 8 weeks of treatment. D dimer data concentration was quantitated by a D dimer immunoturbidimetric assay. Briefly the assay is based on the change in turbidity of a microparticle suspension that is measured by photometry. About 1.5 mL of patient sample sodium citrate plasma was collected and stored in a plastic collection tube. A suspension of latex microparticles coated by covalent bonding with monoclonal antibodies specific for D dimer was mixed with the test plasma whose D dimer level was to be assayed. Antigen antibody reactions leading to an agglutination of the latex microparticles induced an increase in turbidity of the reaction medium. This increase in turbidity was reflected by an increase in absorbance the latter being measured photometrically using a STAGO STA analyzer. The increase in absorbance was a function of the D dimer level present in the test sample.

The averaged data for each dosage concentrations placebo 80 mg 160 mg and 320 mg of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody are plotted in . Error bars were omitted from the graph for clarity purposes. The percent change from baseline in D dimer concentration is plotted in . All dosage levels of Ab1 antibody demonstrated a drop in D dimer levels over placebo over the period of 8 weeks.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of ALD518 or humanized Ab1 in patients with advanced NSCLC.

124 patients pts with NSCLC ECOG 0 3 weight loss in the preceding 3 months of 5 body weight hemoglobin Hb 7 g dL and C reactive protein CRP 10 mg L were dosed. Pts were randomized to 1 of 4 groups n 30 group . Placebo or ALD518 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg was administered intravenously every 8 weeks. Pts were followed up for 24 weeks. Data included hematology clinical chemistry CRP and adverse events AEs .

29 pts completed the study treatments and evaluations 38 failed to complete every visit 52 died of progressive disease and 5 withdrew because of adverse events. There were no dose limiting toxicities DLTs or infusion reactions. 84 pts had serious AEs of which 1 was deemed to be possibly related to administration of ALD518 rectal hemorrhage . The mean SD values for Hb hematocrit Hct mean corpuscular Hb MCH and albumin are below 

ALD518 increased Hb Hct MCH and albumin in NSCLC pts and raised Hb to 12 g dL in 58 of pts with a Hb 11 g dL at baseline. This further indicates that ALD518 can be administered as a non erythropoietic stimulating agent for treating cancer related anemia.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that principally attack synovium of joints. The disease causes painful and potentially disabling inflammation with onset typically occurring between 40 and 50 years of age. Interpretation of drug treatment efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis is made difficult by the myriad of subjective and objective assessment tools made available over the years. The American College of Rheumatology ACR released a standardized set of rheumatoid arthritis measures to facilitate evaluation of improvement of the disease in clinical trials. Felson et al. 36 Arthritis Rheumatism 729 40 1993 .

One hundred twenty seven patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and CRP 10 mg L were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either placebo n 33 80 mg n 32 160 mg n 34 or 320 mg n 28 of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody once at the start of the 16 week trial and again at week 8. Data on CRP concentration was collected every week for the first 4 weeks every two weeks between weeks 4 and 12 and at the conclusion of the test at week 16.

Assessment under the standardized protocols from the American College of Rheumatology were employed in determining the percentage of improvement of patients during the clinical trial and conducted by a person trained in the ordinary art of evaluating rheumatoid arthritis. The evaluation was based upon activity measures including tender joint count swollen joint count the patient s assessment of pain the patient s and physician s global assessments of disease activity and laboratory evaluation of either erythrocyte sedimentation rate or CRP level. Id. The patient s assessment of pain was based upon the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index HAQ DI . Patients that achieve a 20 increase in activity measures for rheumatoid arthritis during a clinical trial are categorized as achieving ACR 20. Similarly patients achieving 50 and 70 improvements are categorized as ACR 50 and ACR 70 respectively.

A significant portion of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis achieved ACR 20 or greater during the course of the study . Patients observed rapid improvement in systems within the first 4 weeks of the study as well as continued steady improvement throughout the course of the 16 week evaluation . The greatest results where exhibited by patients receiving the 320 mg dosage level with 43 achieving ACR 70 status during the study .

Analysis of the individual components of the ACR evaluation demonstrated gains in every component . HAQ DI scores demonstrated clinically meaningful change over placebo during the course of the evaluation . Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in all patients studied . The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid with immediate reduction in CRP levels relative to placebo within one week of Ab1 administration and prolonged diminished levels continued at least until the final measurement was taken up to sixteen weeks . In all cases CRP levels fell to at or below the normal reference range less than 5 6 mg L within one week. Thus administration of Ab1 can cause a rapid and sustained improvement rheumatoid arthritis patients as evidenced by the significant improvement in ACR scores during clinical evaluation and presents an effective treatment regime.

Inflammatory activity associated with rheumatoid arthritis is measured using numerous variables through validated response criteria such as Disease Activity Score DAS DAS28 and EULAR. The DAS is a clinical index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity that combines information from swollen joints tender joints the acute phase response and general health. Fransen J. et al. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 23 Suppl. 39 S93 S99 2005 . The DAS 28 is an index similar to the original DAS but utilizes a 28 tender joint count range 0 28 a 28 swollen joint count range 0 28 ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an optional general health assessment on a visual analogue scale range 0 100 . Id. The European League against Rheumatism EULAR response criteria classify patients using the individual amount of change in the DAS and the DAS value low moderate high reached into one of the following classifications Good Moderate or Non Responders. Id.

One hundred twenty seven patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one 1 hour intravenous IV infusion of either placebo n 33 80 mg n 32 160 mg n 34 or 320 mg n 28 of the Ab1 monoclonal antibody once at the start of the 16 week trial and again at week 8. Data on the DAS28 and EULAR scores was collected every week for the first 4 weeks every two weeks between weeks 4 and 12 and at the conclusion of the test at week 16. Assessment under the standardized DAS28 and EULAR protocols were employed in determining the respective scores of patients during the clinical trial and conducted by a person trained in the ordinary art of evaluating rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients receiving 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg of Ab1 demonstrated improved DAS28 scores relative to those patients receiving placebo over the course of 16 weeks as presented in as a mean change from the baseline DAS28 score. Furthermore a significant percentage of patients receiving 80 mg 160 mg or 320 mg of Ab1 achieved Good or Moderate classifications relative to those patients receiving placebo over the course of 16 weeks. .

Thus administration of Ab1 can result in improved DAS28 and EULAR scores in rheumatoid arthritis when compared to those patients receiving placebo.

A humanized antibody derived from Ab1 humanized Ab1 or ALD518 containing the variable heavy and light sequences in SEQ ID NO 19 and 20 was administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients. This antibody is a humanized asialated IgG1 monoclonal antibody against IL 6 which has been shown to have a half life t of approximately 30 days in humans. In studies in patients with RA intravenous IV with this antibody humanized Ab1 has demonstrated efficacy over 16 weeks with rapid American College of Rheumatology ACR responses Complete and durable suppression of C reactive protein CRP Good tolerability and a safety profile consistent with the biology of IL 6 blockade. This humanized antibody binds to IL 6 with high affinity preventing interaction and signalling mediated via IL 6R. Rapid and significant treatment responses have been demonstrated with intravenous IV administration of humanized Ab1 in patients with RA In this example we study the safety pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous SC administration of humanized Ab1 in healthy subjects.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety pharmacokinetics PK and pharmacodynamics PD of a single SC injection of this humanized antibody in healthy male subjects.

In this Phase I double blind placebo controlled study 27 subjects were randomized 2 1 to receive a single dose of humanized Ab1 or placebo in the following groups humanized Ab1 50 mg SC humanized Ab1 100 mg SC or humanized Ab1 100 mg IV n 6 active and n 3 placebo per group . The primary objective was to assess safety of SC humanized Ab1 versus placebo over 12 weeks. Plasma concentrations of humanized Ab1 and serum concentrations of C reactive protein CRP were assessed as secondary objectives. Assessments were performed daily in Week 1 and then on Day 10 Weeks 2 4 6 and 8 and then monthly to Week 12. The study was unblinded at Week 12 and humanized Ab1 subjects were monitored to Week 24.

The study included 27 healthy male subjects aged 18 65 years . Subjects were dosed in three treatment groups of nine subjects each randomized 2 1 to receive a single dose of humanized Ab1 or placebo on Day 1 . Humanized Ab1 treatments per group were 

The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of SC humanized Ab1 compared with placebo over 12 weeks. Safety was monitored over 12 weeks for all subjects. The study was unblinded at Week 12 and Humanized AB1 subjects were monitored to Week 24.

Laboratory safety tests were performed pre dose at screening and Day 1 and post dose on Days 2 and 7 Weeks 2 4 6 8 and 12 for all subjects and Weeks 16 20 and 24 post dose for those randomized to Humanized Ab1. Anti Humanized AB1 antibodies were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . Blood samples were collected at Day 1 pre dose and Week 12 post dose for all subjects and Week 24 post dose for those randomized to Humanized Ab1.

Plasma Humanized AB1 and serum CRP concentrations were assessed by ELISA. For all subjects samples were collected at screening pre dose on Day 1 and post dose on Days 2 and 7 and Weeks 2 4 6 8 and 12. For subjects randomized to Humanized AB1 further samples were collected at Weeks 16 20 and 24 post dose.

All subjects who received a dose of Humanized AB1 or placebo were included in the safety analysis. All subjects who received a dose of Humanized AB1 or placebo were included in PD and immunogenicity analyses. All subjects who received a dose of Humanized AB1 were included in PK analyses n 18 . All PK samples for placebo subjects were confirmed as below quantification.

Descriptive statistics were generated for baseline demographics safety data plasma Humanized AB1 parameters and serum CRP concentrations. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare CRP concentrations for Humanized AB 1 treatments versus placebo.

Over 24 weeks there were no deaths or serious AEs and no withdrawals due to AEs. Nearly all subjects 89 experienced AEs which were mild or moderate except one event of severe gastroenteritis in the Humanized Ab1 SC 50 mg group. Injection site reactions occurred in 5 12 Humanized Ab1 SC subjects placebo SC subjects and placebo IV subjects none were reported in Humanized Ab1 N subjects . These were mild except one case of moderate erythema and pruritis in the Humanized Ab1 100 mg SC group. Increases in direct bilirubin and neutrophil counts below the limit of normal were more common in subjects receiving Humanized Ab1 than placebo all were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The half life of Humanized Ab1 was similar across all groups mean range 30.7 33.6 days . The median Tof Humanized Ab1 was longer after SC 1 week than after IV administration end of infusion . The PK of SC Humanized Ab1 was dose proportional in terms of AUC and Cat doses of 50 mg and 100 mg. Based on AUC day g mL of 237 452 and 764 for the Humanized Ab1 50 mg SC 100 mg SC and 100 mg N groups respectively the bioavailability of Humanized Ab1 was 60 for the versus IV groups. Subjects receiving Humanized Ab1 experienced rapid and sustained reductions in serum CRP .

A total of 27 subjects were enrolled and completed the study n 18 Humanized Ab1 and n 9 placebo . No subjects were withdrawn for any reason.

All subjects were male 23 27 subjects were Caucasian and 4 27 were Asian. Mean age was 29 range 20 59 and was similar across the groups. Mean height and weight were also generally comparable across groups although the IV placebo group were slightly lighter.

A summary of safety is presented in . For the SC Humanized AB1 groups a total of 11 12 91 patients experienced an adverse event AE compared with 

Injection site reactions were reported in 26 7 27 of subjects and all occurred prior to Week 12 . Injection site reactions occurred in 5 12 SC Humanized AB1 subjects and SC placebo subjects. In the IV groups 0 6 Humanized AB1 subjects and placebo subjects experienced injection site reactions. All injection site reactions were mild except in one SC Humanized AB1 100 mg subject with moderate injection site erythema and pruritis. No injection site reactions occurred after Week 12 in any of the Humanized AB1 groups. Infusion site reactions were reported in 0 6 subjects receiving IV Humanized AB1 and IV placebo subjects infusion site pruritis 

Sporadic decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts were also observed in the Humanized AB1 and placebo groups . Neutrophil counts below the lower limit of normal were more common in subjects receiving Humanized AB1 than placebo but all decreases were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. Only one subject SC Humanized AB1 50 mg group had consistent mild neutropenia to Week 24 1.6 10 L at Week 24 . Reductions in platelet counts were all CTCAE Grade 1 lowest level 134 10 L and no subject had a low platelet count past Week 8.

Bioavailability of Humanized AB1 was 60 for SC Humanized AB1 50 and 100 mg versus IV Humanized AB1 100 mg groups based on the mean AUC . The half life of Humanized AB1 was similar across all groups mean range 30.7 33.6 days . Peak plasma concentration C of SC Humanized AB1 was reduced as compared to IV . Median time to maximum plasma concentration T of Humanized Ab1 was longer after SC Humanized AB1 at approximately one week than after IV Humanized Ab1 administration at approximately the end of infusion .

CRP levels were reduced in all subjects who received Humanized AB1 irrespective of dose or administration route. From Weeks 4 to 12 CRP levels were significantly lower in subjects who received Humanized Ab1 compared with placebo unadjusted p value 

In this Phase I study the anti IL 6 antibody Humanized AB1 was generally well tolerated when administered in a single SC dose in healthy male subjects. Injection site reactions were generally mild. No anti Humanized AB1 antibodies were detected. Changes in liver enzymes neutrophil and platelet counts were reversible. The bioavailability of SC Humanized AB1 was approximately 60 of that observed with IV Humanized AB1. The half life of Humanized AB1 was approximately 30 days irrespective of route of administration. These data concur with previous data using IV Humanized AB12. Subcutaneous Humanized AB1 led to rapid and large reductions in serum CRP. Reductions in CRP observed during the first 12 weeks of the study were sustained over 24 weeks of assessment. These preliminary data support the continued development and evaluation of SC Humanized AB1 for the treatment of patients with RA.

In summary in this Phase I study the anti IL 6 antibody Humanized Ab1 was well tolerated when administered in a single SC dose injection site reactions were generally mild. The bioavailability of SC Humanized Ab1 was 60 of IV Humanized Ab1 and the half life was 30 days. Rapid and significant reductions in CRP were observed which were sustained over 24 weeks of assessment.

As discussed above ALD518 is an asialated humanized anti IL 6 monoclonal antibody with a half life of 30 days containing the humanized variable heavy and light sequences contained in SEQ ID NO 19 and 20. These humanized heavy and light sequences are derived from a parent rabbit antibody that specifically binds human IL 6 which antibody is referred to in said incorporated application as Ab1. ALD518 binds to IL 6 with high affinity preventing interaction and signalling mediated via soluble and membrane bound IL 6R. Rapid and significant ACR responses have been demonstrated with ALD518 in patients with RA. In this example we report the impact of ALD518 on DAS28 assessed disease activity over 16 weeks.

Patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX were randomized 1 1 1 1 to intravenous ALD518 80 160 or 320 mg or placebo during this 16 week double blind placebo controlled Phase II study. Patients received two IV infusions of ALD518 Day 1 and Week 8 while continuing on stable doses of MTX. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 at Week 12 disease activity was assessed via Disease Activity Score DAS28 based on C reactive protein CRP as a secondary endpoint. The proportion of patients achieving DAS28 defined remission score 1.2 were assessed for the modified intent to treat population and are presented for patients with available data as observed . P values are based on Chi square tests.

Of 127 randomized and treated patients 116 completed the trial. At baseline mean age was 52.3 years and RA duration was 6.8 years. At Weeks 4 12 and 16 the proportion of patients achieving LDAS and remission was greater than placebo for all ALD518 doses differences were significant versus placebo p

SAEs were reported in two ALD518 patients both had significant increases in liver enzymes and discontinued treatment . Overall elevations in liver enzymes 2 ULN occurred in 17 of ALD518 versus 0 placebo treated patients the frequency was highest in the 320 mg dose group. Modest increases in total cholesterol were observed mean increase by Week 16 1.1 mmol L for ALD518 versus 0.2 mmol L for placebo . Nine ALD518 patients had transient Grade II and two had transient Grade III neutropenias. There were no serious infections or infusion reactions in any treatment Group and no evident immunogenicity.

In this Phase II study the novel IL 6 inhibitor ALD518 resulted in rapid and significant improvements in disease activity sustained over 16 weeks of assessment in patients with RA and an inadequate response to MTX. ALD518 was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the biology of IL 6 blockade.

Patients with active RA were randomized into a 16 week double blind placebo controlled trial comparing multiple iv infusions of ALD518 80 160 or 320 mg . Patients received an infusion every 8 weeks and were maintained on a stable dose of MTX throughout the trial. Assessments included ACR 20 50 70 responses and DAS28. All patients were evaluated for safety. For early withdrawals LOCF analysis was used for continuous variables and non responder imputation for categorical variables.

132 patients were randomized 127 were dosed. Mean disease duration was 6.6 years mean DAS28 score was 6.2 and mean HAQ DI was 1.72. 11 patients did not complete the 16 week trial 320 mg 3 160 mg 1 80 mg 3 placebo 4 4 discontinued due to adverse events 80 mg 2 320 mg 2 with 2 SAEs 80 mg 1 320 mg 1 . Elevations in liver enzymes LFTs 2xULN were observed in 17 ALD518 versus 0 placebo. There were modest increases in total cholesterol mean increase by week 16 1.1 mmol L ALD518 versus 0.2 mmol L placebo . 9 patients on ALD518 had transient grade 2 neutropenias 2 pts transient grade 3 neutropenias. There were no serious infections reported in any treatment group. Infusions of ALD518 were well tolerated without infusion reactions or evident immunogenicity. At weeks 4 and 16 ACR responses non responder imputation analysis and improvements in DAS28 scores were 

ALD518 is the first mAb to IL 6 as opposed to an anti IL 6 receptor mAb to show a significant rapid and sustained improvement in disease activity in RA. ALD518 in doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg given as 2 IV infusions to pts with active RA was well tolerated with increases in LFTs and total cholesterol and transient neutropenia observed in some patients. There were no infusion reactions associated with administration of ALD518 and no dectectibile immunogenicity.
