According to a third aspect of the present invention a computer readable medium encoded with a computer program comprising computer readable instructions recorded thereon for execution a method comprising receiving by a generic application programming interface a request signal comprising a request for reading one or more files of a plurality of files for implementing a predetermined task the plurality of the files being created using a plurality of applications and being stored in one or more devices wherein the request signal or a part of the request signal does not comprise application specific information converting by the generic application programming interface the request signal or the part of the request signal to one or more application command signals comprising the application specific information each signal of the one or more application command signals defining a corresponding application command for one application of the plurality of the applications and providing the one or more application command signals to corresponding one or more application connectors of a plurality of application connectors comprised in the generic application programming interface for reading all or selected files of the one or more files of the plurality of files to fully or partially implement the predetermined task each application connector of the plurality of the application connectors being configured to read files created using one application of the plurality of the applications.

A new method and software related product e.g. computer readable medium a computer a computer memory or a laser recording disk are presented for using a generic application programming interface GAPI for reading information e.g. multi application files i.e. files created by two or more applications stored in devices e.g. computers computer network devices workstations communication network devices servers memories e.g. archives backup repositories etc.

For example the GAPI e.g. if comprised in an access network computer may be used for reading all multi application files stored in network devices i.e. in servers workstations archives backup repositories etc. comprised in a computer network or reading selected multi application files i.e. selected from the all files comprising one or more predefined features and stored in said network devices followed by creating and or updating e.g. periodically meta data for the files read by using the GAPI and or followed by retrieving requested files out of the multi application files using the meta data for the requested files if the meta data is created and properly updated through the GAPI. The multi application files i.e. files created by two or more applications read by the GAPI may be created using a plurality of known applications which may include but are not limited to e.g. MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EUDORA MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD IBM LOTUS NOTES MAIL FOR MAC OS X any software for e mail that uses MBOX formats to store local e mails etc.

According to an embodiment of the present patent application GAPI may be configured to receive a request signal comprising a request for reading one or more multi application files of a plurality of files created using a plurality of applications and stored in one or more devices for implementing a predetermined task e.g. to search to retrieve to backup and or archive information create meta data etc. wherein the plurality of the files e.g. e mails being created using a plurality of applications wherein the request signal comprising the request or a part of the request signal comprising the part of the request does not comprise application specific information.

Then the GAPI may be configured to convert the request signal or the part of the request signal not comprising the application specific information to one or more application command signals comprising the application specific information e.g. using an application independent request signal as further discussed herein wherein each signal of said one or more application command signals may define a corresponding command for one application of the plurality of the applications e.g. MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EUDORA MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD IBM LOTUS NOTES MAIL FOR MAC OS X any software for e mail that uses MBOX formats to store local e mails etc.

Following the conversion described herein these one or more application command signals may be provided to corresponding one or more application connectors of a plurality of application connectors comprised in the GAPI for reading all or selected files of the one or more files of said plurality of files to fully or partially implement the predetermined task wherein each application connector of the plurality of the application connectors may be configured to read files created using one of the plurality of the applications.

For example the request may be formulated as an abstract command i.e. a command not comprising any application specific information as follows Retrieve all messages stored on devices X and Y and that have been received between Day1 and Day2. Moreover meta data e.g. application related information provided with the request may show that the devices X and Y stores files created by the application MICROSOFT OUTLOOK and MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD. Then application specific defined command comprised in the first application command signal may be Read each .PST files on device X AND fetch all messages whose property 0x003f0102 i.e. PidTagReceivedByEntryId is NOT NULL and property 0x30070040 i.e. PidTagCreationTime is between 2008 Dec. 31 and 2009 Dec. 31 whereas the application specific defined command comprised in the second application command signal may be Read each .EML files on device Y and fetch all messages whose eml tag Received is NOT NULL and eml tag Date is between 2008 Dec. 31 and 2009 Dec. 31 . It is further noted that the request signal or the request may comprise all or selected meta data in a form of an application specific information such that this application specific information may be used directly as one or selected application command signals of the one or more application command signals.

It is noted that for the purposes of the present invention the term application specific information means that the request signal received by the GAPI would comprise information formulated using a specific application language as shown above for the converted application command signals in MICROSOFT OUTLOOK and MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD therefore in the example above the request signal does not comprise application specific information . If the request signal does not comprise such application specific information but comprise additional information e.g. meta data regarding certain applications then this information is defined as application related information for the purposes of the present invention.

Thus the purpose of converting the request signal or the part of the request signal to one or more application command signals described herein is to convert abstract objects comprised in the request provided to the GAPI into application specific formulation of that information. For example the abstract representation comprised in the request of an e mail originator of Jean Christophe CISSE may be jean christphe.cisse addonmail.com . Then after the conversion described herein for the MICROSOFT OUTLOOK application the originator address of Jean Christophe CISSE may be written as O ADDONMAIL OU First Administrative Group CN Recipients CN jean christophe.cisse and for the IBM LOTUS NOTES the originator address of Jean Christophe CISSE may be written as Jean christophe CISSE HQ Europe addonmail.com .

According to another embodiment before the converting to the one or more application command signals comprising the application specific information the GAPI may be configured to generate an application independent request signal in response to the request signal or the part of the request signal not comprising application specific information such that the converting to the one or more application command signals may be performed by the GAPI using or in response to the application independent request signal.

According to yet another embodiment if only the part of the request does not comprise any application specific information but a remaining part of the request comprises the application specific information for one or more applications of the plurality of the applications the GAPI may be further configured to generate one or more further application command signals in response to the remaining part of the request signal and to provide these one or more further application command signals to further one or more corresponding application connectors of the plurality of application connectors comprised in the GAPI for reading all or further selected files of the one or more files of the plurality of files to fully implement the predetermined task as previously discussed herein wherein each further application may be configured to read files created using one of the plurality of the applications.

After receiving the application specific raw information the GAPI may be configured to convert the raw information signal into an information signal not comprising the application specific raw information and forward this information signal to a sender e.g. a specific module in a host computer comprising the GAPI of the request.

Also creating or updating of meta data may be requested in the request signal or in the part of the request signal then the GAPI may be configured to generate a meta data signal not comprising said application specific information for creating or updating meta data using this application specific raw information and forward it e.g. to a meta data creating and updating module in a host computer comprising the GAPI. It is further noted that creation of the meta data may be set as a default in GAPI.

For example the request signal provided to the GAPI may request Search for emails that have been sent between Jan. 1 2009 and Dec. 31 2009 which does not contain any application specific information. Then the one or more application command signals comprising the application specific information may be as follows 

For Application 1 e.g. using MICROSOFT OUTLOOK On network devices search for files .PST then for all found files with .PST search in each files for emails whose property 0x003f0102 is NOT TRUE and property 0x30070040 is between 2009 Jan. 1 and 2009 Dec. 31 

For Application 2 e.g. using IBM LOTUS NOTES On network devices search for files .NSF then for then for all found files with .NSF search in each files for emails whose property 0xFFFe7890 is greater than Jan. 1 2009 and smaller than Dec. 31 2009 and

For Application 3 e.g. using MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD On network devices search for files .eml then for then for all found files with .eml search in each files for emails whose eml tags Date is greater than Jan. 1 2009 and smaller than Dec. 31 2009 .

In step the application switch may send a further meta data signal e.g. the signal in created for further raw information if received corresponding to the application specific part of the request to the meta data collector e.g. the module in . Then in step the meta data collector may send all received meta data to meta data creating and updating module e.g. in host device comprising the GAPI .

The access network computer may also comprise a user interface and or display which may be used for entering user s commands e.g. command to search for all files or selected filed comprising one or more predefined features in the network devices and to create or update meta data for these files command for retrieving selected files e.g. comprising one or more predefined features from the network devices or command to backup and or archive files e.g. comprising one or more predefined features from the network devices which are forwarded as corresponding signals or to the search and detect module and or for possible viewing e.g. displaying on the display user interface retrieved files and created meta data files e.g. stored in a retrieved files storage memory or in a meta data memory it is noted that in general a user interface and display may be implemented as two different modules .

Moreover the search and detect module in response to corresponding request signal or may determine whether the meta data for the requested files comprising one or more predefined features is already exist i.e. stored in the meta data memory and properly updated e.g. within a predetermined time period . If this is the case i.e. the meta data exists and properly updated for the requested files the module may stop the process in response to the command signal or in response to the command signal or the module may provide meta data information about the location of requested files see signals and to corresponding modules for retrieving or for backup and archive which may forward corresponding instruction messages see signals and to the GAPI module for retrieving see signals or of these files.

However if the meta data does not exist or not properly updated for all or some of the requested files comprising one or more predefined features then the module in response to the signal may provide corresponding searching instruction signal it is noted that the signal may correspond to the request signal in e.g. specifying the one or more predefined features of files to search for creating meta data to the GAPI module which may provide then a search signal for reading the requested files as disclosed herein optionally the module may also provide instructions signal for creating corresponding meta data with corresponding characteristics to a meta data creating and updating module e.g. these instructions may be comprised in the original searching command . Also the module in response to the command signal or may provide instruction signals or comprising an indication that meta data for the requested or some of the requested files does not exist to corresponding modules for retrieving or for backup and archive which then may forward corresponding signals or it is noted that the signal or may correspond to the request signal in to the GAPI module for retrieving see signals or which may correspond to signals and in and creating updating see signals or the meta data for the retrieved files comprising one or more predefined features.

According to a further embodiment the module in response to received corresponding information signal or it is noted that the signal or may correspond to the signal in from the GAPI module which comprise information read or retrieved by the GAPI module in response to corresponding signals or may create a desired meta data and store it in the meta data memory as described herein. Moreover the requested files retrieved by the GAPI in response to the corresponding signals or may be forwarded by the GAPI module to the corresponding modules or respectively wherein the module may send the retrieved files to a retrieved file storage memory and or to a requested destination in the computer network or outside of the computer network and the module may send the retrieved files to archive and backup depositories .

According to another embodiment the meta data can be created by the access network computer by default without any request e.g. the module may initiate meta data creation and periodic updating e.g. within 24 hours this meta data using for all or selected files stored in the network devices of the computer network reading the corresponding files by the GAPI module creating meta data using a module and storing the created meta data in the meta data memory as disclosed herein.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the modules or may be implemented as a software or a hardware module or a combination thereof. Furthermore the modules and may be implemented as a separate block or may be combined with any other module block of the access network computer or it may be split into several blocks according to their functionality. Moreover it is noted that all or selected modules of the access network computer may be implemented using an integrated circuit.
