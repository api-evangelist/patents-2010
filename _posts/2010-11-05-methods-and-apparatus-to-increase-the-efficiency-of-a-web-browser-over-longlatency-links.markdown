title: Methods and apparatus to increase the efficiency of a web browser over long-latency links
abstract: The invention increases performance of a browser over long-latency links by smart pre-fetching of selective objects to increasing the level of concurrency in subsequent operations. A Web browser with a pre-fetch agent can speed up Internet transactions from the browser over long-latency data links. This agent can help determine the order of fetching objects in such a way that an object is ready and available locally before the resident browser requires it. The seemingly instantaneous availability of objects to a browser enables it to complete processing the object to request the next object without much wait. Without this instantaneous availability of an embedded object, a browser waits for its request and the corresponding response to traverse a long delay link.
