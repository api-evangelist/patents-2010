This disclosure relates generally to vectored digital subscriber line DSL services and more particularly to methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to allocate ports to vectored DSL groups.

Vectored DSL is an emerging DSL technology that offers significant improvements in downstream transmission rates over twisted pair copper wire. In a vectored DSL communication system a vectoring engine uses collected measurements characterizing crosstalk between a set of subscriber lines to cancel the effects of crosstalk noise experienced by those subscriber lines.

Example methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to allocate ports to vectored digital subscriber line DSL groups are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes obtaining data representative of a statistical distribution of service penetration for a non vectored DSL service estimating an expected vectored DSL group size from the data and configuring a DSL access multiplexer DSLAM to reserve a number of ports of the DSLAM for a vectored DSL group based on the expected vectored DSL group size.

A disclosed example apparatus includes a port assignment database to store data representative of a statistical distribution of service penetration for a non vectored DSL service a vectored DSL group size estimator to compute an expected vectored DSL group size based on the data and a mechanized loop assignment center to reserve a number of ports of a DSLAM line card for a vectored DSL group based on the expected vectored DSL group size.

To provide communication services to the customer premises the example CO of includes any number and or type s of vectored DSLAM s and or vectored video ready access device s VRAD s and the example customer premises of each include any type s of customer premises equipment CPE DSL modems and . The example vectored DSLAM of includes and or implements CO DSL modems not shown for respective ones of the customer premises . CO DSL modems are sometimes referred to in the industry as DSLAM ports VRAD ports or simply ports. In the illustrated example of CO DSL modems are implemented on DSLAM line cards of the vectored DSLAM . Each of the example line cards of implements a plurality of CO DSL modems for respective ones of a plurality of CPE DSL modems e.g. the example CPE DSL modems . An example line card implements sixty four CO DSL modems.

The example vectored DSLAM the CO DSL modems within the vectored DSLAM and or the example CPE DSL modems of may be implemented for example in accordance with the International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Sector ITU T G.993.x family of standards for very high speed DSL VDSL and or the ITU T G.992.x family of standards for asymmetric DSL ADSL . However the CO DSL modems and or the CPE DSL modems may be implemented in accordance with any past present and or future standard specification and or recommendation.

While in the illustrated example of the vectored DSLAM is implemented at the CO the vectored DSLAM another DSLAM and or a VRAD may be additionally or alternatively implemented at an RT at an SAI and or at any other location between the CO and the customer premises . In such instances a fiber optic cable not shown may be used for example to communicatively couple the remotely located DSLAM VRAD to the CO .

In the illustrated example of the vectored DSLAM provides DSL services to the CPE DSL modems via respective subscriber lines and . Subscriber lines are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wire pairs telephone lines subscriber loops and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example loops of a loop e.g. any of the example loops used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises location e.g. any of the locations may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of copper twisted pair wire e.g. any combination of a feeder one F1 cable a feeder two F2 cable a feeder three F3 cable a feeder four F4 cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. an RT an SAI a serving terminal a vault a pedestal and or any other type s of wiring distribution points . Such segments of copper twisted pair wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of copper twisted pair wires used to construct the example loops they will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that the term loop may refer to one or more copper twisted pair wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

When two loops e.g. the example loops are part of the same cable bundle or cable binder the signal transmissions on one loop may cause or introduce crosstalk noise into other loops of the same binder . The amount of crosstalk noise varies with for example signal transmission level frequency and or length of the binder . Crosstalk noise may interfere with and or reduce the achievable transmission speed on a loop. An example binder consists of twenty five copper twisted pair wires.

To reduce the effects of crosstalk interference the example vectored DSLAM includes any number and or type s of vectoring engines . The example vectoring engines of obtain measurements representing the crosstalk between member loops of a vectored DSL group from the CO DSL modems and or the CPE DSL modems associated with the vectored DSL group. As used herein the term vectored DSL group is a group or set of loops contained in the same binder for which a vectored DSL service is provisioned. Based on the obtained measurements the example vectoring engines adjust one or more parameters of the CO DSL modems and or the CPE DSL modems associated with the vectored DSL group to reduce cancel mitigate and or minimize the effects of crosstalk and thus increase the transmission speeds achievable on each member loop of the vectored DSL group. While the vectoring engines and the line cards are depicted separately in the line cards may each implement and or include one or more of the vectoring engines .

For non vectored DSL services there is no need for particular loops to be communicatively coupled to the particular line cards . Thus when a new non vectored DSL service is provisioned for a particular loop the loop can be assigned and or communicatively coupled to any vacant port of any line card . However vectored DSL services require that each member loop of a vectored DSL group be communicatively coupled to the same vectoring engine . Given current technology and the computational load required to reduce crosstalk for a vectored DSL group the example vectoring engines of are only capable of reducing crosstalk for twenty four to forty eight loops which is similar to or less than the number of CO DSL modems implementable on the example line cards . Accordingly in the illustrated example of each of the vectoring engines is only communicatively coupled to a single line card . Thus each member loop of a vectored DSL group is assigned to and communicatively coupled to the same line card . However if a present or future vectoring engine is communicatively coupleable to more than one line card the methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to provision vectored DSL services disclosed herein can be readily extended.

When a new vectored DSL group is provisioned e.g. when the first loop of a vectored DSL group is provisioned the new vectored DSL group is assigned and or allocated to a line card with a statistically sufficient number of available ports for the vectored DSL group. In other words when the first loop of a new vectored DSL group is provisioned additional ports of the same line card are reserved in anticipation of future vectored DSL services in the new vectored DSL group. If too small a number of ports is reserved then requests for additional vectored DSL services in the new vectored DSL group may need to be rejected or may cause service disruptions to move the vectored DSL group to a different line card . The rejection of requested services and or service disruptions may cause decreased revenue and or decreased customer satisfaction. If too large a number of ports is reserved then DSLAM line card and or vectoring engine resources are wasted leading to increased capital expenditures. The methods apparatus and articles of manufacture disclosed herein estimate predict and or anticipate the size of vectored DSL groups and use the estimated vectored DSL group size during the provisioning of vectored DSL services.

In a typical DSL distribution area there are 50 to 100 cable binders and significantly fewer line cards e.g. four 48 port line cards and thus several binders will share the same line card . The methods apparatus and articles of manufacture disclosed herein may be used to estimate predict and or anticipate the size of vectored DSL groups based on the statistics of DSL service penetration. In an example mature DSL market region the penetration ratio of DSL services is typically 30 e.g. about 8 loops in each 25 pair binder carry a DSL service . Thus in a mature DSL market region the size of a vectored DSL group is expected to be between 1 and 8 ports. However allocation of 8 ports per vectored DSL group is likely to result in excess capital expenditure and an allocation of 1 2 ports per vectored DSL group is likely to result in excess service request rejections.

To estimate the expected or anticipated vectored DSL group size the example communication system of includes a vectored DSL group size estimator . Based on data representative of the statistical distribution of service penetration for a similar i.e. non vectored DSL such as VDSL the example vectored DSL group size estimator computes and or determines the statistical expected or anticipated vectored DSL group size. An example estimated vectored DSL group size is N where N is selected so that the probability that the number of DSL services in a binder exceeding N is less than a threshold. This example criteria can be expressed mathematically as Probability number of DSL services in binder 0 43.6 Probability number of DSL services in binder 1 31.0 Probability number of DSL services in binder 2 20.5 Probability number of DSL services in binder 3 12.2 Probability number of DSL services in binder 4 7.0 Probability number of DSL services in binder 5 4.2 Probability number of DSL services in binder 6 2.3 Assuming a vectored DSL service will have similar penetration statistics and selecting X 5 then a vectored DSL group is statistically expected to include 5 loops and thus 5 ports to be allocated and or reserved for a new vectored DSL group.

Another example criteria includes the number of customer premises served or passed by the binder . For example if only 2 customer premises are served by the particular binder reserving 5 ports for a vectored DSL group associated with that binder is excessive. This example criteria can be expressed mathematically as Probability number of DSL services in binder given the binder serves customer premises 

Yet another example criteria considers that several binders will share the same line card and thus the reserved ports can be statistically shared across two or more vectored DSL groups. This example criteria can be expressed mathematically as Probability number of DSL services in binders connected to the same line cards 

To assign ports to the example loops the example vectored DSL communication system of includes any type of mechanized loop assignment center MLAC server and a port loop assignment database . Port to loop assignments may be stored in the example port loop assignment database of using any number and or type s of data structures. The example port loop assignment database may implemented using any number and or type s of volatile and or non volatile memory ies memory device s and or storage device s .

In response to for example an order for a new vectored DSL service for a particular loop received from for example any type of customer service server the example MLAC server of queries the example vectored DSL group size estimator to obtain an estimated vectored DSL group size. The example MLAC server identifies or selects a line card having a sufficient number of available ports for the new vectored DSL group. The MLAC server assigns and or selects a particular port of the selected line card to the loop by updating the port loop assignment database and notifying appropriate technician and or service personnel to couple the loop to the assigned port. The MLAC server also reserves additional ports on the selected line card to accommodate anticipated future vectored DSL services in the new vectored DSL group.

If during the provisioning of an additional member loop of a vectored DSL group the example MLAC server together with the example vectored DSL group size estimator determines that there are not enough available ports for the vectored DSL group to support anticipated future needs the example MLAC server of automatically generates and or submits a maintenance ticket to any type of trouble ticket system . Such an automatically generated and or submitted maintenance ticket represents preventative prospective forecasted and or projected maintenance needs that should be performed in order to for example reduce the likelihood that a future vectored DSL service requested service cannot be accepted and or provisioned when requested by a subscriber. In response to the submitted maintenance ticket appropriate service and or maintenance personnel can be dispatched to move and or relocate the vectored DSL group to a different line card if available. Alternatively capacity planning personnel can analyze and or consider the installation of additional ports at the CO .

While an example vectored DSL communication system is illustrated in one or more of the elements processes and or devices illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged omitted eliminated and or implemented in any other way. Further the example vectored DSL group size estimator the example MLAC server the example port loop assignment database the example customer service server and or the example trouble ticket system may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Thus for example any of the example vectored DSL group size estimator the example MLAC server the example port loop assignment database the example customer service server and or the example trouble ticket system could be implemented by the example processor platform P of and or one or more circuit s programmable processor s application specific integrated circuit s ASIC s programmable logic device s PLD s and or field programmable logic device s FPLD s field programmable gate array s FPGA s fuses etc. When any apparatus claim of this patent incorporating one or more of these elements is read to cover a purely software and or firmware implementation at least one of the example vectored DSL group size estimator the example MLAC server the example port loop assignment database the example customer service server and or the example trouble ticket system are hereby expressly defined to include a tangible article of manufacture such as a tangible computer readable medium storing the firmware and or software. Further still any of the example vectored DSL group size estimator the example MLAC server the example port loop assignment database the example customer service server and or the example trouble ticket system may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

As used herein the term tangible computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable medium and to expressly exclude propagating signals. Example computer readable medium include but are not limited to a volatile and or non volatile memory a volatile and or non volatile memory device a compact disc CD a digital versatile disc DVD a floppy disk a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM a programmable ROM PROM an electronically programmable ROM EPROM an electronically erasable PROM EEPROM an optical storage disk an optical storage device magnetic storage disk a magnetic storage device a cache and or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration e.g. for extended time periods permanently brief instances for temporarily buffering and or for caching of the information and which can be accessed by a processor a computer and or other machine having a processor such as the example processor platform P discussed below in connection with . As used herein the term non transitory computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable medium and to exclude propagating signals.

To obtain data representative of a statistical distribution of service penetration for a non vectored DSL service the example vectored DSL group size estimator includes a port loop assignment database interface . Using any number and or type s of application programming interface s message s and or protocol s the example port loop assignment database interface of queries the example port loop assignment database to obtain information regarding the number of DSL services allocated in different binders the number of customer premises served by different binders and or the number of binders sharing different line cards.

To tabulate compute and or generate values representing service penetration the example vectored DSL group size estimator includes a service penetration rate analyzer . The example service penetration rate analyzer of obtains data representative of a statistical distribution of non vectored DSL service penetration via the example port loop assignment database interface and analyzes the obtained data to compute the statistical distribution of non vectored DSL service. For example the service penetration rate analyzer can count the number of binders with 1 or more DSL services the number of binders with 2 or more DSL services etc. Such count values represent a statistical distribution of service penetration.

To estimate vectored DSL group size the example vectored DSL group size estimator of includes a group size predictor . The example group size predictor computes probability values corresponding to the statistical count values computed by the example service penetration rate analyzer . For example if 100 binders were analyzed by the service penetration rate analyzer and the count of binders with 3 or more DSL services is 21 then the probability that there are 3 or more DSL services in a binder is 21 21 100 . The group size predictor compares the computed probabilities to determine the value of N as for example described above in connection with EQNs 1 2 and 3 . The identified value of N represents the statistically expected vectored DSL group size. The group size predictor returns the value N to the MLAC server via the MLAC interface .

While an example manner of implementing the example vectored DSL group size estimator of is shown in one or more of the elements processes and or devices illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged omitted eliminated and or implemented in any other way. Further the example MLAC interface the example port loop assignment database interface the example service penetration rate analyzer the example group size predictor and or more generally the example vectored DSL group size estimator of may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Thus for example any of the example MLAC interface the example port loop assignment database interface the example service penetration rate analyzer the example group size predictor and or more generally the example vectored DSL group size estimator could be implemented by the example processor platform P of and or one or more circuit s programmable processor s application specific integrated circuit s ASIC s programmable logic device s PLD s and or field programmable logic device s FPLD s field programmable gate array s FPGA s fuses etc. When any apparatus claim of this patent incorporating one or more of these elements is read to cover a purely software and or firmware implementation at least one of the example MLAC interface the example port loop assignment database interface the example service penetration rate analyzer the example group size predictor and or more generally the example vectored DSL group size estimator are hereby expressly defined to include a tangible article of manufacture such as a tangible computer readable medium storing the firmware and or software. Further still any of the example MLAC interface the example port loop assignment database interface the example service penetration rate analyzer the example group size predictor and or more generally the example vectored DSL group size estimator may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

The example process of begins with the example MLAC server receiving a request for a new vectored DSL service block . The example vectored DSL group size estimator obtains data representative of a statistical distribution of penetration for a comparable DSL service from the port loop assignment database block . Based on the obtained data the example vectored DSL group size estimator computes the statistically expected anticipated and or estimated vectored DSL group size block .

If the vectored DSL service request represents a new vectored DSL group block the MLAC server identifies a line card with sufficient available ports to accommodate the estimated vectored DSL group size block . The MLAC server assigns the requested service to the identified line card block and reserves additional ports on the line card to accommodate future vectored DSL services associated with the new vectored DSL group block . Control then exits from the example process of .

Returning to block if the vectored DSL services does not represent a new vectored DSL group block the MLAC server identifies the line card currently assigned to the existing vectored DSL group block . If the identified line card has sufficient available ports to accommodate the estimated vectored DSL group size less the already allocated ports of the vectored DSL group block control proceeds to block to assign the vectored DSL service to a port of the line card . If the identified line card does not have sufficient available ports to accommodate the estimated vectored DSL group size less the already allocated ports of the vectored DSL group block the MLAC server assigns the new vectored DSL service to a port of the identified line card if available block and automatically submits a trouble ticket to notify maintenance service and or capacity planning personnel that a sufficient number of ports for the vectored DSL group is not available block . For example if 90 of the ports allocated to the vectored DSL group have been assigned to subscriber loops the trouble ticket is submitted. In some examples a submitted ticket is routed to the example MLAC server to initiate further and or additional capacity planning and or demand forecasting for the vectored DSL group. Control then exits from the example process of .
