One or more implementations relate generally to installing code and more particularly to regulating access of code to be installed.

The subject matter discussed in the background section should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its mention in the background section. Similarly a problem mentioned in the background section or associated with the subject matter of the background section should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in the background section merely represents different approaches which in and of themselves may also be inventions.

In conventional code distribution systems code created by a developer is distributed to one or more users. For example a provider may distribute developer created code to one or more users of the code. Unfortunately conventional code distribution systems have been associated with various limitations.

Just by way of example traditional methods of distributing code to a user and installing such code have used static access criteria. Additionally such methods of distributing code fail to coordinate with users of the code with respect to the access boundaries of such code. Accordingly it is desirable to provide techniques that increase the flexibility and communication involved with code distribution.

In accordance with embodiments there are provided mechanisms and methods for conditionally enabling an installation aspect. These mechanisms and methods for conditionally enabling an installation aspect can enable an improved determination of boundaries associated with the code improved communication between code developers and users improved security and access restriction etc.

In an embodiment and by way of example a method for conditionally enabling an installation aspect is provided. In one embodiment code to be installed within a multi tenant on demand database system is identified. Additionally an aspect required with respect to the code is identified. Further the aspect is conditionally enabled based on one or more criteria.

While one or more implementations and techniques are described with reference to an embodiment in which enabling an installation aspect is implemented in a system having an application server providing a front end for an on demand database system capable of supporting multiple tenants the one or more implementations and techniques are not limited to multi tenant databases nor deployment on application servers. Embodiments may be practiced using other database architectures i.e. ORACLE DB2 by IBM and the like without departing from the scope of the embodiments claimed.

Any of the above embodiments may be used alone or together with one another in any combination. The one or more implementations encompassed within this specification may also include embodiments that are only partially mentioned or alluded to or are not mentioned or alluded to at all in this brief summary or in the abstract. Although various embodiments may have been motivated by various deficiencies with the prior art which may be discussed or alluded to in one or more places in the specification the embodiments do not necessarily address any of these deficiencies. In other words different embodiments may address different deficiencies that may be discussed in the specification. Some embodiments may only partially address some deficiencies or just one deficiency that may be discussed in the specification and some embodiments may not address any of these deficiencies.

As used herein the term multi tenant database system refers to those systems in which various elements of hardware and software of the database system may be shared by one or more customers. For example a given application server may simultaneously process requests for a great number of customers and a given database table may store rows for a potentially much greater number of customers.

Next mechanisms and methods for conditionally enabling an installation aspect will be described with reference to example embodiments.

In another embodiment the code may be associated with a platform of the multi tenant on demand database system. For example the code may be drafted in a programming language associated with the multi tenant on demand database system. In another example the code may be drafted in order to integrate with the platform of the multi tenant on demand database system.

Additionally in one embodiment the code may be drafted by an entity associated with the multi tenant on demand database system. For example the code may be drafted by a partner of the multi tenant on demand database system a developer associated with the multi tenant on demand database system etc. Further in another embodiment the code may provide a service in association with the multi tenant on demand database system. In another embodiment the code may include an enhancement of a service provided by the multi tenant on demand database system.

It should be noted that as described above such multi tenant on demand database system may include any service that relies on a database system that is accessible over a network in which various elements of hardware and software of the database system may be shared by one or more customers e.g. tenants . For instance a given application server may simultaneously process requests for a great number of customers and a given database table may store rows for a potentially much greater number of customers. Various examples of such a multi tenant on demand database system will be set forth in the context of different embodiments that will be described during reference to subsequent figures.

Additionally as shown in operation an aspect required with respect to the code is identified. In one embodiment the aspect may include data that is required to be accessed by the code when the code is installed and run within the multi tenant on demand database system. For example the aspect may include accessing data within the multi tenant on demand database system e.g. within a database of the multi tenant on demand database system a table in the database etc. by the code when the code is installed and run. In another example the aspect may include accessing data and or communicating data outside of the multi tenant on demand database system e.g. external network data external databases third party services etc. by the code when the code is installed and run.

Additionally in another embodiment the aspect may include operations that are performed on data that is accessed by the code when the code is installed and run e.g. within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . For example the aspect may include whether data is created by the code within the multi tenant on demand database system. In another example the aspect may include whether data accessed by the code e.g. data within the multi tenant on demand database system outside the multi tenant on demand database system etc. is read by the code updated e.g. written to etc. by the code deleted by the code sent by the code e.g. to an external network source etc. etc.

Further in still another embodiment the aspect may include one or more methods of accessing data that are required by the code e.g. when the code is installed and run on the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . For example the aspect may include whether an element of the multi tenant on demand database system e.g. an associated database etc. is accessed utilizing a programming language associated with the multi tenant on demand database system. In another example the aspect may include whether the element of the multi tenant on demand database system is accessed utilizing a particular application programming language API e.g. a web services API etc. . Additionally in another embodiment the aspect may include one or more references from one or more components that are created declaratively e.g. one or more workflow rules etc. .

Further still in one embodiment the aspect may be identified by analyzing the code. For example the code may be statically introspected in order to determine what data is being accessed by the code and how such access is occurring. In another embodiment the aspect may be identified by a provider of the multi tenant on demand database system. For example the aspect may be identified by a provider of the multi tenant on demand database system when the code is submitted to the multi tenant on demand database system when the code is developed in association with the multi tenant on demand database system etc.

In yet another embodiment the identified aspect may be presented to an entity associated with the code. For example the identified aspect may be presented to a developer of the code e.g. when the developer submits the code to the multi tenant on demand database system distributes the code through the multi tenant on demand database system etc. Additionally in one embodiment the developer may elaborate upon the identified aspect in response to the presentation. For example the developer may provide a motivation behind the aspect a reason for the aspect etc.

Further in one embodiment the aspect required with respect to the code may be extended based on the identifying. For example a provider of the multi tenant on demand database system may add or extend access to data models of the multi tenant on demand database system e.g. databases tables in databases etc. that may be accessed by the code in addition to data models already accessed by the code according the aspect. In this way the code may access resources of the multi tenant on demand database system that the developer of the code may not have been aware of.

Further as shown in operation the aspect is conditionally enabled based on one or more criteria. In one embodiment enabling the aspect may include allowing the code to access particular data within the multi tenant on demand database system outside of the multi tenant on demand database system etc. In another embodiment enabling the aspect may include allowing the code to perform one or more operations on data within the multi tenant on demand database system outside of the multi tenant on demand database system etc. In yet another embodiment enabling the aspect may include allowing one or more methods of accessing data by the code. In still another embodiment enabling the aspect may include installing the code within the multi tenant on demand database system.

Additionally in one embodiment a user e.g. a subscriber of the multi tenant on demand database system etc. may be presented with the aspect required with respect to the code. For example the user may be presented with a notice associated with the aspect e.g. via a graphical user interface GUI an electronic mail message etc. in response to the user attempting to install the code within the multi tenant on demand database system. In one embodiment the notice may include an indication that the aspect required with respect to the code needs to be approved by the user.

Additionally input from the user in response to the presentation of the aspect to the user may be received e.g. via a keyboard touch screen voice command etc. . Further the aspect may be conditionally enabled based on the input from the user. For example the aspect may be disabled if the user indicates that the aspect required with respect to the code is not desired. In another example the aspect may be enabled if the user indicates that the aspect required with respect to the code is acceptable.

In another embodiment one or more rules associated with enabling the aspect may be generated e.g. by a user etc. . For example the rules may indicate one or more aspects of the code that are determined to be allowable by the user. In another example the rules may indicate one or more entities associated with the code that are determined to be trusted by the user e.g. a trusted developer etc. . Additionally the aspect may be conditionally enabled based on the one or more rules. For example the aspect may be compared against the rules e.g. in response to the user attempting to install the code within the multi tenant on demand database system and if one or more of the rules are met by the aspect then the aspect may be enabled. However if one or more of the rules are not met by the aspect then the aspect may be disabled.

In another example the code and or an entity associated with the code may be compared against the rules and if one or more of the rules are met by the code and or the entity associated with the code then the aspect may be enabled. However if one or more of the rules are not met by the code and or the entity associated with the code then the aspect may be disabled.

Further in one embodiment the aspect required with respect to the code may be extended based on one or more elements associated with the user. For example the user may add or extend access to data models of the user e.g. databases tables in databases etc. that may be accessed by the code in addition to data models already accessed by the code according the aspect. In this way the code may access resources of the user that the developer of the code may not have been aware of.

As shown in operation a developer creates an application to be installed within a multi tenant on demand database system. In one embodiment the application may access one or more data elements inside or outside the multi tenant on demand database system. In another embodiment the application may perform one or more actions on the data elements e.g. creating reading updating deleting etc. . Further the application may access the one or more data elements through one or more methods of access e.g. through a database programming language an application programming interface API etc. .

Additionally as shown in operation a system detects a method of access used by the application. In one embodiment the system may be associated with the multi tenant on demand database system. For example the system may include an application development component of the multi tenant on demand database system. In another embodiment the system may detect the method of access by analyzing the application. For example the system may perform static introspection on the application code in order to determine what elements in the multi tenant on demand database system e.g. one or more database tables etc. are being accessed by the application. In yet another embodiment the system may detect one or more data elements accessed by the application one or more actions performed on the data elements etc.

Further in one embodiment the system may inform the developer of necessary access associated with the application based on the detection. For example the system may notify the developer that the application needs to access one or more elements in the multi tenant on demand database system. In this way the developer may be notified of all elements for which access needs to be granted in order to install the application.

Further still as shown in operation the developer extends detected access manually. For example in response to a notification that the application needs to access one or more elements inside or outside of the multi tenant on demand database system the developer may extend access to those elements manually.

Also as shown in operation the developer distributes the application. In one embodiment the developer may distribute the application by submitting it to a provider for distribution. For example the developer may distribute the application by submitting it to the multi tenant on demand database system for distribution to one or more users subscribers etc.

In addition as shown in operation a user requests to install the application and is prompted to approve access defined by the developer. In one embodiment the user may request to install the application within the multi tenant on demand database system provided to the user. In another embodiment the prompt to approve access may include a visual prompt e.g. a pop up screen a warning page etc. an audio prompt etc.

Furthermore as shown in decision it is determined whether the user approves the access defined by the developer. If in decision it is determined that the user does approve of the access defined by the developer then in operation the application is installed and the access defined by the developer is permitted. For example the application may be installed within the multi tenant on demand database system and the application may be given access to one or more data elements inside or outside the multi tenant on demand database system as defined by the developer.

However if in decision it is determined that the user does not approve of the access defined by the developer then in operation the application is not installed e.g. within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . In this way the application may be contained by the user so that the application may not performed one or more actions not authorized by the user e.g. transmitting information associated with the user outside of the multi tenant on demand database system accessing and or altering sensitive data within the multi tenant on demand database system interfering with other applications within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. .

Additionally see for example How to be Successful with Salesforce Sep. 27 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and which describes exemplary methods of package access control.

In one embodiment the method for controlling application access may be associated with package access control PAC of the multi tenant on demand database system. For example an aspect or PAC feature may scope and control what objects a partner s package can access in a subscriber s org. The feature covers access via workflow Apex API and the metadata API. In addition the feature may alert subscribers to packages that are using technologies in which access cannot be controlled. In another embodiment dynamic apex and extension packages may be supported. In addition for an iteration PAC may only be supported at the object level not field.

Additionally in another embodiment one or more exemplary use cases may be provided. For example a subscriber may want to use a partner application that extends the accounts and contacts objects of a CRM application. The partner application uses a session ID to make updates via an API. The subscriber may not want this session ID to be used to retrieve opportunity data down to the field level. In another example partners may want to access subscriber added fields to their managed installed objects through dynamic apex. In yet another example partners may want to access subscriber added fields to standard objects through dynamic apex. In still another example partners may want to access all objects and fields in the org using dynamic apex. For instance if you were building a find and replace tool or some sort admin. tool that would be applicable to any object.

In order to better protect customers PAC may optionally now always be enabled for managed packages. It may never be an option to disable it.

In yet another embodiment PAC spidering and object selection may occur. We may make a basic assumption that a partner should always have full CRUD access to the data contained in the objects in their package. No warnings or approval may be required on install in this case. If the customer does not trust the partner app then don t install it.

We may automatically detect static references to objects not included in the package standard and extension and force enable access to these objects in PAC using the appropriate CRUD setting. The partner and subscriber cannot disable these settings. For this area we may check the following components Table 1 illustrates one example of components that may be checked in accordance with PAC. Of course it should be noted that the components shown in Table 1 is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

In another embodiment when create read update and delete CRUD functionality is selected we may mimic the UI logic used on the profile page for selecting related CRUD e.g. Select C also enabled R Select E also enabled R Select D also enabled RE etc. . Additionally removing a selection may remove the dependent CRUD options too.

Further in one embodiment the developer may enable access to additional platform objects standard CRM objects or base package objects. Note the developer may not select local custom objects. Subscribers may not be allowed to disable these references. Further still the subscriber may enable PAC on the same entities the developer can control. In addition the subscriber may enable PAC on any object in their org even local custom objects or objects in other packages unrelated to the partner s package.

Also in one embodiment development with PAC may be provided. For example when a component is added to a package instantly the package s PAC settings may be enforced on the component. PAC may never be used to introduce a dep on or spider an object into a package. While typically this shouldn t occur in the event that a package is installed and PAC is specified on a standard object that does not exist in the subscriber we should install the PAC record but hide it in the UI. If later the subscriber upgrades enables a feature that exposes that object then the PAC row should become visible and apply.

Further at runtime and when running apex tests if the dev attempts to reference an object where PAC is not enabled we may throw an exception with specific details on how to resolve the problem. This case could occur when an object in a base package or a platform object is references via the API or dynamic Apex. Additionally the cache may be invalidated when making changes to PAC or adding removing components from a package.

In addition in one embodiment since PAC may be enabled on ALL managed packages and legacy unmanaged packages we may need a way to handle packages that contain insecure components such as scontrols. For example if a package includes an s control the dev. may not be allowed to enable PAC settings. Subscribers may enable PAC in this scenario. In reverse if PAC is enabled on the package in the dev org then the dev may not add scontrols to the package. Since scontrols are insecure the thought was we were calling this out by not allowing you to set PAC with them included.

Further as an option the developer may be allowed to include insecure components in any package with PAC enabled. Inclusion may cause a security warning to appear on the dev package during install time and on the package in the subscriber s org. The basic idea is that these insecure components may not be covered by package security. This feature may apply to managed packages only.

Table 2 illustrates exemplary insecure components. Of course it should be noted that the components shown in Table 2 is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

In yet another embodiment one or more objects may not be covered by PAC. Some of these may be considered platform objects such as user. Others represent metadata like scontrol. Some arbitrary decisions may be made around which objects you gain access to from this set when PAC is enabled.

In still another embodiment access to platform objects may not be implicitly offered. They may be treated as any other object that can be controlled by PAC. References may be detected and automatically included.

In one embodiment a PAC session ID may be used to access the metadata API mdAPI . By default a PAC session ID may not be allowed to call the metadata API. In another embodiment no PAC session IDs may be allowed to call the mdAPI. Additionally we may now offer a new way for a partner to use the mdAPI with a PAC session ID. In PAC a partner may enable mdAPI access. This may apply to the entire org not scoped to the package. If partner enables then subscriber cannot disable. The subscriber may also enable just like with CRUD PAC.

Table 4 illustrates calls that a partner may perform when mdAPI access is enabled for an object. Of course it should be noted that the calls shown in Table 4 is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

Further in one embodiment in the future we may find holes in PAC and want to patch them. For some holes we may be able to easily enforce them on subscriber orgs. For others we might only be able to enforce them in the dev org and then have to wait for a package upgrade to occur for the change to be implemented on subscriber orgs. For instance we might not be able to enforce PAC on workflow emails and apex emails this release. If we want to add these then we may need to only make this change in the dev org and wait for an upgrade to occur to enforce in sub orgs.

Further still in another embodiment in a package.xml file found in the IDE a list may be maintained of the package members the package s PAC setting and a list of the CRUD settings for each object where PAC can be specified. The presents of the tag may determine whether the package is using new PAC or old PAC. If the tag isn t present but the package is managed and includes tags then we may assume that package uses new PAC So basically on one embodiment no new package uploads should include a tag.

Table 6 illustrates code for adding a new tag with new PAC to house the comments associated with an entity. Of course it should be noted that the code shown in Table 6 is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

In another embodiment one or more rules may be provided for inferring full CRUD associate entity access when the parent is enabled for Read. Most would rather see a 1 1 CRUD mapping of associate entity access to parent. An example associate entity is Account Share and the parent is Account. In this case enabling RE on Account would only enable RE on all associate entities like Account Share.

In still another embodiment a user may be a somewhat special entity in that almost every UI page displays some piece of data from that entity. We may want to track PAC on user however if only read access is enabled on user and that is the only entity with PAC enabled then we may skip showing the PAC warning during package install. We may not want the PAC warning appearing on every package install which would likely occur if we checked user.

Additionally in one embodiment we may have a mechanism to alert an installer that a partner s package is composite and talks to an external service. This could be as simple as a web link to points to a non SFDC domain callouts in Apex etc. We may address this problem today by detecting the domain used in custom buttons links and listing those domains during install next to the component.

In another embodiment another way to come at this problem may be to use the remote settings and trusted IP ranges to alert installers. Callouts Outbound messaging Web links e.g. external etc. External links VF page Buttons links with JS Page saves via button link Email services may all be included.

Further in one embodiment push upgrades may be provided. For example on initial install the subscriber may be asked to approve the extension package s access to the declared base package objects. In the case of push upgrades we may not simply auto enable PAC. We may have the admin approve the PAC. In one embodiment two options are available 1 Block the push until the admin has approved PAC. If they never approve it then the push will never complete. Additionally see for example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 784 666 Attorney Docket Number SFC1P055 093US filed May 21 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and which describes exemplary application update pushing.

The other option is 2 Allow the push to proceed. Block operation of certain functions until PAC is approved by the admin. Give devs a way to determine if PAC was approved. In one embodiment partners may choose between the two options. In another embodiment if we go with option 2 for the upgrade then we may use CRUC as a way for partners to request access from admins. They may either have to accept or decline the access in CRUC.

Further still in one embodiment a package developer may have to have ways to code for the various cases when they haven t been granted access. They may also need a way to test for this. For example with respect to workflow outbound messaging two options may exist Option 1 where messages may not be sent until the access is added It basically would be skipped over and Option 2 which may require that workflow OM on an object where PAC is new be added to a new workflow rule. Then that rule may be enabled post install. Block enabling the rule if it includes actions where PAC is not authorized.

Also in another embodiment with respect to apex email alerts an exception may be thrown when an email using a template for an object where PAC is not enabled tries to be sent. In yet another embodiment two options may be provided with respect to workflow email alerts and workflow field updates. In one option emails may not be sent until the access is added. It basically would be skipped over. In another option it may be required that workflow OM on an object where PAC is new be added to a new workflow rule. Then that rule must be enabled post install. Block enabling the rule if it includes actions where PAC is not authorized.

Additionally in one embodiment a runtime exception may be thrown in apex when Accessing trigger. Returning SOQL SOSL DML on object etc. In another embodiment a test may be performed with PAC enabled vs. Disabled. In yet another embodiment it may be determined whether PAC is enabled or disabled. Additionally a hook may be used for sending user to page to update PAC and a returnURL to redirect them back. Additionally it may be determined if a user is authorized to update PAC. Further with respect to VF a redirect may exist to a page that says no access if using standard controller may include a link to PAC etc. .

Further in one embodiment PAC may be made easier to use and understand for both developers and subscribers. PAC settings may become more transparent and both developers and subscribers will receive appropriate security warnings for packages containing insecure components. This feature may steer developers away from including insecure components in their packages as well as encourage development of managed packages while further asserting an unmanaged package as a template like mechanism for passing data between orgs.

In the embodiment below PAC settings may be thought of as PAC CRUD permissions and Metadata API access for an entity. In a first step a developer of a managed package may specify PAC on objects in the package. These may exclude custom entities in developer org not included in the package. Entities not included in the package but referenced by certain components see section 3 may have PAC settings configured automatically.

In a second step at package installation time the subscriber may be presented with the PAC settings defined by developer along with the explanation as to why a particular entity has a particular set of permissions. In a third step having installed the package a subscriber may specify PAC settings on additional objects. These can include any entities available in the subscriber org. Settings specified by the developer may not be edited or removed.

In one embodiment by virtue of including appropriate logic in the package the developer may obtain a session ID from the subscriber org. This session ID may be marked as restricted by the appropriate PAC settings e.g. based on the PAC settings of the package from which this session ID is obtained . In this case only specified set of actions may be allowed to be executed using this session ID.

In another embodiment objects contained in the package may be treated as one in terms of PAC CRUD and Metadata API permissions. Metadata API access for objects of the package may be disabled by default. Full PAC CRUD permissions may always be granted to all objects in the package. Neither developer nor subscriber may be able to disable full PAC CRUD permissions for objects in the package. Subscribers may not be able to take away PAC CRUD permissions or Metadata API access specified by developer for a given entity. Subscriber may be able to grant more permissions for a given entity. PAC CRUD and Metadata API permissions may be configured at an entity level not at a field level.

Additionally a Developer may not be able to specify PAC settings for local custom entities. It may be possible for the developer to manually enable PAC on platform objects and associate entities. PAC CRUD and Metadata API permissions on associate entities may be set with 1 1 correspondence to permissions on parent entity ie AccountShare may get read CRUD permission if Account entity was configured to have read CRUD permission. Subscriber may be able to specify PAC CRUD settings and Metadata API access on all entities in their org.

In another embodiment enabling PAC on a package may enable standard UDD CRUD permissions automatically for entities for which PAC is not specified. We may take a white list approach and disable access to any entity not included in the package which does not have PAC explicitly specified. This may alter the way objects are accessed in Udd. Additionally at package installation time no page may be shown with PAC settings of the package being installed.

Also in yet another embodiment during spidering and object selection static references for entities not included in the package may be evaluated and used to configure PAC CRUD settings for these entities. Only components that modify data may be taken into consideration workflow outbound messages workflow field updates Apex classes triggers and VF pages controllers may trigger PAC settings for entities involved.

If an entity not included in the package and which doesn t have appropriate PAC CRUD permissions set is referenced using Dynamic Apex an exception may be thrown containing instructions to either remove the reference to the entity or set appropriate PAC CRUD permissions on it. If subscriber org does not have standard objects for which the PAC settings are specified in the package they have installed we may keep track of these settings without subscriber knowledge. If such standard object becomes available in subscriber org we may then display appropriate PAC settings on Package Access Settings page.

Additionally in one embodiment partners may have a capability of calling Metadata API using the PAC restricted session id. By default no Metadata API calls originating from partners with such session id may be allowed. It may now be possible for both developer and subscriber to specify ability to make Metadata API calls involving an entity. As with PAC CRUD settings if a developer specified that they want Metadata API access for an entity a subscriber may not be able to disable this access. A subscriber may be able to enable Metadata API access.

When creating the Metadata .zip file for the managed package we may need to account for new xml tag inside the tag. This tag proposed name may be set to true if the Metadata API access is enabled for the given entity. Another new tage proposed name may hold a short explanation of developer to subscriber as to why they set PAC on a given entity. tag will be remain but its meaning may now change it may signify whether or not the Metadata API permissions for All Objects in Package were turned on.

Further in another embodiment a current schema may include Tables core.dev package version and coreinstalled package version which may contain PAC PERMISSION LEVEL column NOT NULL NUMBER . This can have a value of 0 meaning the package does not have PAC settings enabled 1 not used and 2 meaning the package has PAC settings enabled . Table core.pac entity permissions contains column PERMISSIONS ALLOWED1 which holds values 2 3 6 7 14 15 which correspond to all possible permutations of entity CRUD permissions besides the one with all CRUD permissions disabled.

Table 7 illustrates exemplary schema changes and suggested renaming in accordance with one embodiment. Of course it should be noted that the schema changes shown in Table 7 are set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

In another embodiment standard objects and extended custom entities may be found in core.pac entity permissions. However we may add platform entities and associate entities. Entities may be allowed to have 0 in this column.

In yet another embodiment neither subscriber not developer may be able to disable full CRUD permissions for All Objects In Package . In general subscriber may only be able to alter PAC CRUD permissions and Metadata API access for an entity thereby altering values of PAC CRUD and MD API ACCESS columns for the corresponding entity in core.pac entity permissions if the new values are greater than the ones in DEV PAC CRUD and DEV MD API ACCESS respectively. In effect this may allow subscribers to add permissions while disallowing taking permissions away.

In one embodiment if a developer specifies PAC settings or Metadata API settings for an entity a subscriber may get the corresponding row in core.pac entity permissions. In this row DEV PAC CRUD and DEV MD API ACCESS columns may be set to the values of PAC CRUD and MD API ACCESS in the row for the corresponding entity in the developer org at package upload time. Appropriate xml tags may be introduced inside the tag for the package.xml file.

Additionally in another embodiment PAC settings may not be overwritten for a subscriber upon upgrades ie once we insert a row into core.pac entity permissions for a given package for subscriber org we may not alter this value upon upgrade to a new version of the package. This may change such that the PAC CRUD new may be set to the value max PAC CRUD old DEV PAC CRUD new . DEV PAC CRUD may always be updated. In similar fashion we may set MD API ACCESS new to maximum of MD API ACCESS old DEV MD API ACCESS new and may always update the DEV MD API ACCESS value.

Table 8 illustrates exemplary screen list details in accordance with one embodiment. Of course it should be noted that the screen list details shown in Table 7 are set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner.

Further we may need a script to set Metadata API permissions to false for all packages currently using PAC. This may be disabled by default for all new managed packages. We may need scripts to fill API ACCESS LEVEL columns in core.dev package version and core.installed package version. Further still we may need a script to generate appropriate rows in core.pac entity permissions. In case of packages with Unrestricted PAC level we may need to set full PAC CRUD permissions for all objects in the org. In case of packages with PAC enabled we may need to generate rows for entities access to which may be granted automatically when PAC gets enabled to clarify we may not be automatically configuring PAC for random objects . This may include generating new rows for associate entities if the parent entities are included. We may not be generating new rows for developer packages they may be told to configure PAC access for entities that are causing issues .

In another embodiment some of the above scripts may be consolidated they re listed separately to point out their optional purpose. Additionally in one embodiment we may need to make sure the check for whether or not a given operation can be performed on a given entity with respect to PAC settings is not creating a serious lag. Existence and correctness of PAC CRUD permissions and Metadata API access may depend on creating a proper package.xml file inside the Metadata .zip Upgrading a script to generate the missing rows may be possible.

Additionally the set of entities for which PAC settings are to be configured may be a small subset of all entities accessible in the org. At this point we may not impose limits such as how many entities can have PAC configured for a given package. We may want to set a cut off as to how many or what type of these we display on the Package Security Settings page.

Further existence and correctness of PAC CRUD permissions in developer org may depend on detecting references to entities in the package during spidering. Existence and correctness of PAC CRUD permissions and Metadata API access may depend on creating a proper package.xml file inside the Metadata .zip. The ability to detect whether or not a given session ID is PAC restricted may depend on correct session object construction we may be interested in apiClientAllPackageld field of the session object being set correctly .

Further still in another embodiment new and modified screens may be internationalized including the security info messages. PAC settings may be configured on certain entities in developer org and these settings exist and may not be taken away in the subscriber org. Metadata API access may be configured on certain entities in developer org and these settings may exist and may not be taken away in subscriber org.

Also components such as Apex may be included that have static references to entities outside the package and appropriate PAC permissions may be set on these entities e.g. see spidering . With a managed package partners may not execute certain action calls with PAC restricted session ID. Additionally the subscriber may view correct PAC CRUD Metadata API permissions set by developer may not be able to take them away and may add to them. Also Security Info messages may exist both on developer and subscriber sides and a picklist input box may exist on a Package Access Settings Page. Further PAC permissions may appear disappear when references to entities get added removed from the package on developer side. Cache invalidation may be appropriately addressed.

In another embodiment changes may be made to the way we check most likely not the way but the location of the check API client s session ID for whether or not it is PAC restricted. In some places we may add this check in the first place see Risks and Omissions. Additionally accessibility may not change. VisualForce may be used to develop the only page with considerable changes Package Access Settings Page.

In yet another embodiment a blacklist approach may be used when it comes to allowing certain action calls when clients use a PAC restricted session id. We may convert this to a white list approach and prohibit the use of all action calls with PAC restricted session id unless the code has been annotated by a developer to indicate that it should be allowed to run.

As shown in operation a request to perform an operation is received. In one embodiment the request to perform the operation may be sent by an application installed within a multi tenant on demand database system. For example an application installed in a user account within the multi tenant on demand database system may send the request to perform the operation. In another embodiment the request to perform the operation may include a request for the operation to be performed within the multi tenant on demand database system.

In another embodiment the operation may include accessing one or more data elements inside or outside the multi tenant on demand database system. In yet another embodiment the operation may include performing one or more actions on the data elements. In still another embodiment the operation may include accessing the one or more data elements through one or more methods of access.

Additionally as shown in operation the requested operation is checked against an approved access list. In one embodiment the approved access list may be created by a provider of the multi tenant on demand database system. In another embodiment the approved access list may be created by a user of the multi tenant on demand database system. In another embodiment the approved access list may be dynamically created based on one or more elements associated with the user the provider etc. For example the approved access list may be created based on a policy of the user provider etc.

In yet another embodiment the approved access list may include a list of one or more operations that are allowed e.g. within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . For example the approved access list may indicate one or more data elements that may be accessed inside or outside the multi tenant on demand database system one or more actions that may be performed on the data elements one or more methods of access that may be allowed for an application etc.

Further as shown in decision it is determined whether the operation is allowed. For example it may be determined whether the operation requested to be performed involves access that is found within the approved access list. If in decision it is determined that the operation is allowed then in operation the operation is executed. For example the operation may be performed within the multi tenant on demand database system. However if in decision it is determined that the operation is not allowed then in operation the operation is denied. For example the operation may not be performed within the multi tenant on demand database system. In this way access requested by the operation of an application may be controlled by a user of the application and the user may therefore be able to contain the application to their specifications. Additionally one or more boundaries may be created within an internal communications platform e.g. the multi tenant on demand database system etc. .

As shown illustrates a package window of a developer interface which displays a plurality of details relating to a particular package created by a developer. It should be noted that although the present developer interface relates to a Bug Tracker any package created by a developer may be presented. Additionally the package window includes an package security icon that can be used to edit the security settings of the package. In one embodiment after a developer has completed creation of the package the developer may edit the security settings of the package by selecting the icon .

Additionally illustrates a security settings window of the developer interface which displays an existing setup and data access of the package created by the developer. As shown the security settings window is accessed by selecting the package security icon found in . Additionally the security settings window includes an edit icon that is used to edit a setup and data access for the package.

Further illustrates an edit setup and data access window of the developer interface that is accessed by selecting the edit icon found in . The edit setup and data access window includes a selectable field where the developer may select whether the package is allowed to modify a setup utilizing a metadata API as well as selectable fields where the developer may select whether the package is allowed one or more of read create edit and delete access to a plurality of objects.

Additionally the edit setup and data access window includes forms for inputting one or more reasons for allowing setup and data access as denoted in fields and . In this way the developer may provide an explanation to subscribers of the package as to why the package is requesting certain access. Further still illustrates the edit setup and data access window after the developer has input reasons for allowing setup and data access in forms . The developer may save such input my selecting the save icon .

Also illustrates an updated package window once the developer has saved their reasons for allowing setup and data access. Such submitted reasons are displayed to the developer for review in the reasons location . In this way a developer may create a package add components to that package and update security settings associated with the package.

As shown in a package installation details window is provided to a subscriber who desires to install a particular package. Again it should be noted that although the present developer interface relates to a Bug Tracker 6.5.2 any package desired to be installed by a subscriber may be presented. As shown when the subscriber decides to proceed with the installation of the package the subscriber selects the continue icon .

In response to the subscriber s selection of the continue icon a warning is provided to the subscriber as shown in . The warning indicates to the subscriber that the package could change or delete subscriber data and could modify the subscriber s existing setup e.g. the subscriber s setup within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . By clicking on the What data can it access and why icon further information regarding specific data access is displayed to the subscriber as shown in . By clicking on the Why does it need to modify my setup icon a publisher s explanation as to why the package needs to modify the subscriber s setup is provided to the subscriber as shown in .

Additionally by clicking on the continue install icon of a security level of the package to be installed is then selected from window of . After a security level is chosen the subscriber clicks on the next icon which takes the subscriber to an install package page as shown in where the subscriber then installs the package by selecting the Install icon .

After selecting the Install icon the package is installed e.g. within the multi tenant on demand database system etc. and a package install completed page is provided to the subscriber as shown in . By clicking on the View Package Contents icon of the package install completed page a package details page is provided to the subscriber as shown in . The package details page includes a warning to the subscriber notifying the subscriber that the safety of some of the components in the installed package is not ensured by the provider e.g. the provider of the multi tenant on demand database system etc. . By selecting the Which Components link the subscriber is provided with a security warning information page as shown in . The security warning information page includes a list of components whose safety cannot be ensured as well as a general security warning explaining possible actions the components might take.

Additionally by selecting the Package Security icon in the package details page of the subscriber is provided with a package security settings page that illustrates all existing setup access and data access for the package as shown in . By selecting the edit icon of the package security settings page the subscriber is provided with an edit setup and data access page as shown in . By selecting field of the edit setup and data access page the subscriber may enter one or more characters into such field as shown in and such entry in the field may be added to the list of data access objects as an additional object as shown in .

Further by selecting the save icon of the edit setup and data access page the added object is added to the package security settings page as shown in . In this way a subscriber may extend the access of the package to one or more objects that may not have been known by the developer but that the subscriber wants the package to operate across.

In another embodiment a warning may be provided to the subscriber if only unsafe components are included within a package to be installed. For example illustrates an exemplary warning indicating to a subscriber that the safety of components of a package to be installed is not ensured. Additionally in yet another embodiment a warning may be provided to the subscriber if the package is unmanaged or not managed by package access control. For example illustrates an exemplary warning indicating to a subscriber that no security policy is enforced on a package to be installed. In this way the subscriber may be notified of potential issues associated with a package prior to the package being installed.

Environment is an environment in which an on demand database system exists. User system may be any machine or system that is used by a user to access a database user system. For example any of user systems can be a handheld computing device a mobile phone a laptop computer a work station and or a network of computing devices. As illustrated in and in more detail in user systems might interact via a network with an on demand database system which is system .

An on demand database system such as system is a database system that is made available to outside users that do not need to necessarily be concerned with building and or maintaining the database system but instead may be available for their use when the users need the database system e.g. on the demand of the users . Some on demand database systems may store information from one or more tenants stored into tables of a common database image to form a multi tenant database system MTS . Accordingly on demand database system and system will be used interchangeably herein. A database image may include one or more database objects. A relational database management system RDMS or the equivalent may execute storage and retrieval of information against the database object s . Application platform may be a framework that allows the applications of system to run such as the hardware and or software e.g. the operating system. In an embodiment on demand database system may include an application platform that enables creation managing and executing one or more applications developed by the provider of the on demand database system users accessing the on demand database system via user systems or third party application developers accessing the on demand database system via user systems .

The users of user systems may differ in their respective capacities and the capacity of a particular user system might be entirely determined by permissions permission levels for the current user. For example where a salesperson is using a particular user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that salesperson. However while an administrator is using that user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that administrator. In systems with a hierarchical role model users at one permission level may have access to applications data and database information accessible by a lower permission level user but may not have access to certain applications database information and data accessible by a user at a higher permission level. Thus different users will have different capabilities with regard to accessing and modifying application and database information depending on a user s security or permission level.

Network is any network or combination of networks of devices that communicate with one another. For example network can be any one or any combination of a LAN local area network WAN wide area network telephone network wireless network point to point network star network token ring network hub network or other appropriate configuration. As the most common type of computer network in current use is a TCP IP Transfer Control Protocol and Internet Protocol network such as the global internetwork of networks often referred to as the Internet with a capital I that network will be used in many of the examples herein. However it should be understood that the networks that the one or more implementations might use are not so limited although TCP IP is a frequently implemented protocol.

User systems might communicate with system using TCP IP and at a higher network level use other common Internet protocols to communicate such as HTTP FTP AFS WAP etc. In an example where HTTP is used user system might include an HTTP client commonly referred to as a browser for sending and receiving HTTP messages to and from an HTTP server at system . Such an HTTP server might be implemented as the sole network interface between system and network but other techniques might be used as well or instead. In some implementations the interface between system and network includes load sharing functionality such as round robin HTTP request distributors to balance loads and distribute incoming HTTP requests evenly over a plurality of servers. At least as for the users that are accessing that server each of the plurality of servers has access to the MTS data however other alternative configurations may be used instead.

In one embodiment system shown in implements a web based customer relationship management CRM system. For example in one embodiment system includes application servers configured to implement and execute CRM software applications as well as provide related data code forms webpages and other information to and from user systems and to store to and retrieve from a database system related data objects and Webpage content. With a multi tenant system data for multiple tenants may be stored in the same physical database object however tenant data typically is arranged so that data of one tenant is kept logically separate from that of other tenants so that one tenant does not have access to another tenant s data unless such data is expressly shared. In certain embodiments system implements applications other than or in addition to a CRM application. For example system may provide tenant access to multiple hosted standard and custom applications including a CRM application. User or third party developer applications which may or may not include CRM may be supported by the application platform which manages creation storage of the applications into one or more database objects and executing of the applications in a virtual machine in the process space of the system .

One arrangement for elements of system is shown in including a network interface application platform tenant data storage for tenant data system data storage for system data accessible to system and possibly multiple tenants program code for implementing various functions of system and a process space for executing MTS system processes and tenant specific processes such as running applications as part of an application hosting service. Additional processes that may execute on system include database indexing processes.

Several elements in the system shown in include conventional well known elements that are explained only briefly here. For example each user system could include a desktop personal computer workstation laptop PDA cell phone or any wireless access protocol WAP enabled device or any other computing device capable of interfacing directly or indirectly to the Internet or other network connection. User system typically runs an HTTP client e.g. a browsing program such as Microsoft s Internet Explorer browser Netscape s Navigator browser Opera s browser or a WAP enabled browser in the case of a cell phone PDA or other wireless device or the like allowing a user e.g. subscriber of the multi tenant database system of user system to access process and view information pages and applications available to it from system over network . Each user system also typically includes one or more user interface devices such as a keyboard a Mouse trackball touch pad touch screen pen or the like for interacting with a graphical user interface GUI provided by the browser on a display e.g. a monitor screen LCD display etc. in conjunction with pages forms applications and other information provided by system or other systems or servers. For example the user interface device can be used to access data and applications hosted by system and to perform searches on stored data and otherwise allow a user to interact with various GUI pages that may be presented to a user. As discussed above embodiments are suitable for use with the Internet which refers to a specific global internetwork of networks. However it should be understood that other networks can be used instead of the Internet such as an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a non TCP IP based network any LAN or WAN or the like.

According to one embodiment each user system and all of its components are operator configurable using applications such as a browser including computer code run using a central processing unit such as an Intel Pentium processor or the like. Similarly system and additional instances of an MTS where more than one is present and all of their components might be operator configurable using application s including computer code to run using a central processing unit such as processor system which may include an Intel Pentium processor or the like and or multiple processor units. A computer program product embodiment includes a machine readable storage medium media having instructions stored thereon in which can be used to program a computer to perform any of the processes of the embodiments described herein. Computer code for operating and configuring system to intercommunicate and to process webpages applications and other data and media content as described herein are preferably downloaded and stored on a hard disk but the entire program code or portions thereof may also be stored in any other volatile or non volatile memory medium or device as is well known such as a ROM or RAM or provided on any media capable of storing program code such as any type of rotating media including floppy disks optical discs digital versatile disk DVD compact disk CD microdrive and magneto optical disks and magnetic or optical cards nanosystems including molecular memory ICs or any type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and or data. Additionally the entire program code or portions thereof may be transmitted and downloaded from a software source over a transmission medium e.g. over the Internet or from another server as is well known or transmitted over any other conventional network connection as is well known e.g. extranet VPN LAN etc. using any communication medium and protocols e.g. TCP IP HTTP HTTPS Ethernet etc. as are well known. It will also be appreciated that computer code for implementing embodiments can be implemented in any programming language that can be executed on a client system and or server or server system such as for example C C HTML any other markup language Java JavaScript ActiveX any other scripting language such as VBScript and many other programming languages as are well known may be used. Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems Inc. .

According to one embodiment each system is configured to provide webpages forms applications data and media content to user client systems to support the access by user systems as tenants of system . As such system provides security mechanisms to keep each tenant s data separate unless the data is shared. If more than one MTS is used they may be located in close proximity to one another e.g. in a server farm located in a single building or campus or they may be distributed at locations remote from one another e.g. one or more servers located in city A and one or more servers located in city B . As used herein each MTS could include one or more logically and or physically connected servers distributed locally or across one or more geographic locations. Additionally the term server is meant to include a computer system including processing hardware and process space s and an associated storage system and database application e.g. OODBMS or RDBMS as is well known in the art. It should also be understood that server system and server are often used interchangeably herein. Similarly the database object described herein can be implemented as single databases a distributed database a collection of distributed databases a database with redundant online or offline backups or other redundancies etc. and might include a distributed database or storage network and associated processing intelligence.

User system network system tenant data storage and system data storage were discussed above in . Regarding user system processor system A may be any combination of one or more processors. Memory system B may be any combination of one or more memory devices short term and or long term memory. Input system C may be any combination of input devices such as one or more keyboards mice trackballs scanners cameras and or interfaces to networks. Output system D may be any combination of output devices such as one or more monitors printers and or interfaces to networks. As shown by system may include a network interface of implemented as a set of HTTP application servers an application platform tenant data storage and system data storage . Also shown is system process space including individual tenant process spaces and a tenant management process space . Each application server may be configured to tenant data storage and the tenant data therein and system data storage and the system data therein to serve requests of user systems . The tenant data might be divided into individual tenant storage areas which can be either a physical arrangement and or a logical arrangement of data. Within each tenant storage area user storage and application metadata might be similarly allocated for each user. For example a copy of a user s most recently used MRU items might be stored to user storage . Similarly a copy of MRU items for an entire organization that is a tenant might be stored to tenant storage area . A UI provides a user interface and an API provides an application programmer interface to system resident processes to users and or developers at user systems . The tenant data and the system data may be stored in various databases such as one or more Oracle databases.

Application platform includes an application setup mechanism that supports application developers creation and management of applications which may be saved as metadata into tenant data storage by save routines for execution by subscribers as one or more tenant process spaces managed by tenant management process for example. Invocations to such applications may be coded using PL SOQL that provides a programming language style interface extension to API . A detailed description of some PL SOQL language embodiments is discussed in commonly owned co pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 828 192 entitled PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EXTENDING APIS TO EXECUTE IN CONJUNCTION WITH DATABASE APIS by Craig Weissman filed Oct. 4 2006 which is incorporated in its entirety herein for all purposes. Invocations to applications may be detected by one or more system processes which manages retrieving application metadata for the subscriber making the invocation and executing the metadata as an application in a virtual machine.

Each application server may be communicably coupled to database systems e.g. having access to system data and tenant data via a different network connection. For example one application server might be coupled via the network e.g. the Internet another application server might be coupled via a direct network link and another application server might be coupled by yet a different network connection. Transfer Control Protocol and Internet Protocol TCP IP are typical protocols for communicating between application servers and the database system. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other transport protocols may be used to optimize the system depending on the network interconnect used.

In certain embodiments each application server is configured to handle requests for any user associated with any organization that is a tenant. Because it is desirable to be able to add and remove application servers from the server pool at any time for any reason there is preferably no server affinity for a user and or organization to a specific application server . In one embodiment therefore an interface system implementing a load balancing function e.g. an F5 Big IP load balancer is communicably coupled between the application servers and the user systems to distribute requests to the application servers . In one embodiment the load balancer uses a least connections algorithm to route user requests to the application servers . Other examples of load balancing algorithms such as round robin and observed response time also can be used. For example in certain embodiments three consecutive requests from the same user could hit three different application servers and three requests from different users could hit the same application server . In this manner system is multi tenant wherein system handles storage of and access to different objects data and applications across disparate users and organizations.

As an example of storage one tenant might be a company that employs a sales force where each salesperson uses system to manage their sales process. Thus a user might maintain contact data leads data customer follow up data performance data goals and progress data etc. all applicable to that user s personal sales process e.g. in tenant data storage . In an example of a MTS arrangement since all of the data and the applications to access view modify report transmit calculate etc. can be maintained and accessed by a user system having nothing more than network access the user can manage his or her sales efforts and cycles from any of many different user systems. For example if a salesperson is visiting a customer and the customer has Internet access in their lobby the salesperson can obtain critical updates as to that customer while waiting for the customer to arrive in the lobby.

While each user s data might be separate from other users data regardless of the employers of each user some data might be organization wide data shared or accessible by a plurality of users or all of the users for a given organization that is a tenant. Thus there might be some data structures managed by system that are allocated at the tenant level while other data structures might be managed at the user level. Because an MTS might support multiple tenants including possible competitors the MTS should have security protocols that keep data applications and application use separate. Also because many tenants may opt for access to an MTS rather than maintain their own system redundancy up time and backup are additional functions that may be implemented in the MTS. In addition to user specific data and tenant specific data system might also maintain system level data usable by multiple tenants or other data. Such system level data might include industry reports news postings and the like that are sharable among tenants.

In certain embodiments user systems which may be client systems communicate with application servers to request and update system level and tenant level data from system that may require sending one or more queries to tenant data storage and or system data storage . System e.g. an application server in system automatically generates one or more SQL statements e.g. one or more SQL queries that are designed to access the desired information. System data storage may generate query plans to access the requested data from the database.

Each database can generally be viewed as a collection of objects such as a set of logical tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. A table is one representation of a data object and may be used herein to simplify the conceptual description of objects and custom objects. It should be understood that table and object may be used interchangeably herein. Each table generally contains one or more data categories logically arranged as columns or fields in a viewable schema. Each row or record of a table contains an instance of data for each category defined by the fields. For example a CRM database may include a table that describes a customer with fields for basic contact information such as name address phone number fax number etc. Another table might describe a purchase order including fields for information such as customer product sale price date etc. In some multi tenant database systems standard entity tables might be provided for use by all tenants. For CRM database applications such standard entities might include tables for Account Contact Lead and Opportunity data each containing pre defined fields. It should be understood that the word entity may also be used interchangeably herein with object and table .

In some multi tenant database systems tenants may be allowed to create and store custom objects or they may be allowed to customize standard entities or objects for example by creating custom fields for standard objects including custom index fields. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 817 161 filed Apr. 2 2004 entitled CUSTOM ENTITIES AND FIELDS IN A MULTI TENANT DATABASE SYSTEM and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference teaches systems and methods for creating custom objects as well as customizing standard objects in a multi tenant database system. In certain embodiments for example all custom entity data rows are stored in a single multi tenant physical table which may contain multiple logical tables per organization. It is transparent to customers that their multiple tables are in fact stored in one large table or that their data may be stored in the same table as the data of other customers.

While one or more implementations have been described by way of example and in terms of the specific embodiments it is to be understood that one or more implementations are not limited to the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements.
