Embodiments of the invention relate to a distributed topology enabler for an identity manager that controls user access to different Identity Manager IM systems.

An Identity Manager IM system controls user access to different systems. Systems may be described as end points that need user identification userid management. Systems may be any combination of computers computer applications network devices human interface devices appliances etc.

Operationally these requirements present challenges in conventional IM systems. For example conventional IM systems have difficulty with the requirements to manage the reconciliation load and scheduling of tens of thousands of services the need to distribute IM configuration tasks for these services and the need to provide a rolling schedule for system maintenance activities without bringing down entire IM functionality. Some conventional IM systems may be deployed in a cluster to improve performance and provide failover but in very large configurations the conventional IM systems do not provide maintenance or an upgrade window or control over reconciliation load management or decentralized administration and maintenance.

Thus there are drawbacks of existing IM solutions in very large scale implementations. For example scalability may be reached by adding nodes to a cluster but this solution may suffer from the bottleneck of a single data repository. Also an outage or maintenance window may bring down the entire IM infrastructure. Moreover the configuration tasks are managed and implemented on a single application putting configuration load at one point.

Provided are a method computer program product and system for combining existing identity management information from multiple Identity Manager IM nodes. The combined information from the multiple IM nodes is presented. A provisioning request to change the identity management information is received. The provisioning request is decomposed to form multiple separate sub requests. One or more IM nodes are identified to process the sub requests. The sub requests are issued to the one or more IM nodes in parallel. A status of each of the sub requests is received from each of the one or more IM nodes that is processing that sub request. The received statuses are combined. The combined statuses are returned as a status of the provisioning request.

In the following description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which illustrate several embodiments of the invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.

Embodiments introduce a distributed approach to deploying Identity Manager IM nodes. The distributed approach is based on providing a Distributed Topology Enabler for Identity Manager DTEIM node i.e. management node on top of multiple IM nodes and dividing the service workload across the multiple IM nodes e.g. hosting hundreds or thousands of services . Embodiments provide a DTEIM node for combined management and views of a user s identity and account information across the enterprise s multiple IM nodes while decentralizing IM node configuration and administration tasks. The DTEIM node routes user requests to the appropriate IM nodes. Then the DTEIM node combines information received from different IM nodes and presents this combined information to an end user. In various embodiments the term user may represent a human user a computer program a hardware device etc.

In certain embodiments the term DTEIM architecture refers to the entire abstract DTEIM infrastructure including DTEIM components. In certain embodiments the term DTEIM topology refers to the collection of IM nodes under the control of the DTEIM engine .

Embodiments provide a progressively scalable solution at very large IM implementations by distributing the identity information and services across multiple IM nodes . In certain embodiments an IM implementation is a reference to the size of an IM solution including the number of users services etc. and not to the size of an IM node hardware software.

In certain embodiments the use of the DTEIM engine at DTEIM servers such as at DTEIM server provide the following 

With the DTEIM engine there is a distributed IM architecture to provide a progressively scalable solution to a very large user and service base. In certain embodiments the DTEIM topology consists of loosely coupled IM nodes accessed via a DTEIM server . In certain embodiments the DTEIM engine may be a JAVA 2 Platform Enterprise Edition J2EE application that functionally behaves as a combined reverse proxy server plus information and response combiner. The DTEIM engine distributes e.g. sprays user requests to one of many IM member nodes based on the one or more target services and combines identity manager information and responses from multiple IM nodes to the end user. JAVA and J2EE are trademarks of Sun Microsystems in the United States other countries or both. 

The DTEIM engine provides the DTEIM services and provides an API implementation. The API combines user information from different IM nodes communicates with IM nodes using a web services interface discovers services in IM nodes maintains service to an IM node mapping provides functionality similar to IM self services capability and utilizes the local DTEIM server to derive node person and account relationships.

The DTEIM engine combines responses from different IMs to present to the end user. The DTEIM engine also hosts a Distributed IM API DTEIM API module which can be used by external web applications to provide a custom User Interface UI or be called by a JAVA client. Below a DTEIM User Interface UI web application is provided to illustrate DTEIM capabilities and API usage and can be used as a base to set up a custom UI.

Since the DTEIM topology consists of loosely coupled IM nodes that are administered independently the DTEIM topology allows IM objects that are local to an individual IM node to be configured and managed at the IM node itself instead of burdening the DTEIM topology. The focus of the DTEIM server is to provide end user services across the DTEIM architecture using the DTEIM engine . The DTEIM architecture provides a high degree of decentralization while the end users get a unified view of the distributed services across multiple IM nodes .

The DTEIM architecture also allows IM nodes to have different person populations and the DTEIM architecture keeps track of a user s footprint across IM nodes e.g. which IM nodes that the user participates in .

The DTEIM architecture consists of a global DTEIM management node a DTEIM server and DTEIM directory server that interacts with one or more independent IM member nodes. The DTEIM management node combines identity management data from multiple IM nodes to present to users receives requests from users and routes requests to the one or more member IM nodes that are responsible for the request s target. Each of the member IM nodes can be fully clustered IM nodes that are responsible for a subset of services that the distributed system will manage. The DTEIM UI application can also be clustered to offer high throughput and provide failover. The DTEIM node provides the capabilities to manage IM node information route requests combine results and present an API for user interface development. In certain embodiments the DTEIM node uses a local Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP data store or LDAP directory server to hold configuration information and object stubs of entity objects that point to the distributed locations of these entity objects. The object stubs may be for people i.e. people stubs accounts i.e. account stubs services i.e. service stubs etc. Each object stub points to a complete entity object for the people accounts services etc. stored at an IM node .

One of the IM nodes is designated as the main people node. Identity Human Resource HR feeds may be input into this main people node bypassing the DTEIM node . The IM IM adapter is leveraged to distribute person objects from the main IM node to other IM nodes via policy configuration. That is each IM node gets an identity feed from the main IM node via the IM IM adapters. Each child IM node appears as a managed platform in the main IM node . The IM policies and automatic entitlements may be configured to distribute person objects to the child IM nodes based on person criteria. In certain embodiments the IM IM adapter uses a standard adapter framework.

In certain embodiments the DTEIM node communicates with the IM nodes by using a web services based abstraction of the IM API. For example the DTEIM node routes user requests to the appropriate IM node over the web services interface. The DTEIM distribution contains an IM web services connector that is installed in front of each IM node. This removes IM API and web services version dependency when communicating with the IM nodes and provides a lightweight and standard communication HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP based protocol instead of other protocols e.g. the JAVA Remote Method Invocation RMI interface over the Internet Inter Orb Protocol IIOP also referred to as RMI over IIOP used by the IM API .

Person and account changes that occur on the IM nodes independently or as a result of operations initiated from the DTEIM node are notified back to the DTEIM node via a DTEIM notifier module that is installed on the IM nodes as part of the DTEIM infrastructure. The DTEIM notifier modules use web services based communication to communicate from an IM node to the DTEIM node.

The DTEIM engine retrieves person information from the main IM node following a stub reference . Then changes are written back to the main IM node which distributes the changes to participating IM nodes . . . via IM IM adapters . . . . The DTEIM engine retrieves and updates account objects by following the account stub reference. The DTEIM engine retrieves other objects from participating IM nodes . . . in parallel. Thus the time to retrieve objects is as long as the longest time to retrieve from any single IM. The main IM node may host an identity repository and optionally a subset of services. The identity repository stores a collection of person entities.

The IM layer consists of one or more IM nodes . . . . The IM nodes . . . may be geographically separate. Each IM node . . . includes respectively an IM server . . . an IM directory server . . . an IM database . . . IM web services . . . and end points . . .

One of the IM nodes is designated the main IM node and maintains all identities in an IM database or other data store . Identity feeds are carried out on the main IM node via the identity feed .

The DTEIM notifier is a workflow proxy module and is installed into each IM node . . . respectfully to notify the DTEIM engine about person and account object creation or deletion. This notification may be sent via the IM web services . . .

Each IM node . . . notifies the DTEIM engine of account and person changes via the notifier module using a web services interface. For example adds and deletes of entity objects are notified. In certain embodiments attribute changes other than suspend restore are not notified.

The IM web services may be described as a web services wrapper for the IM API. The DTEIM architecture leverages the IM API web services wrapper of the web services . . . to communicate with the IM nodes . . . and the standard IM IM adapter . . . to distribute person information across the IM nodes . . .

In the DTEIM engine manages the IM nodes . . . . Node is the main IM node and manages a subset of services. Node and Node n are IM nodes that manage their respective subsets of services.

Each IM node . . . has IM web services . . . that listen for calls by the DTEIM engine against the IM platform. In certain embodiments the DTEIM engine talks to the IM web services . . . over standard HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure HTTP S or Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP over HTTPS. The IM web services . . . may internally use an IM API to service the call and send back a web service response. Also non JAVA clients e.g. .net clients are able to communicate with the IM nodes . . . . The IM API complexity is abstracted by the web services functional API.

In the Peer to Peer topology each IM node has independent identity feeds from authoritative sources. Common persons in different IM nodes have the same unique one or more identifying attributes.

In a Master Child topology the DTEIM engine assumes that each IM node . . . uses a common authentication provider so that a user can be authenticated on any of the IM nodes . . . with the same credential. This type of authentication is typically achieved by using an external authentication repository such as an enterprise directory. In certain alternative embodiments the DTEIM engine and IM nodes may leverage an access control product that provides Single Sign On SSO capabilities and authentication may be delegated to the access control product.

End users log onto the DTEIM engine using the same authentication that they would have used for an IM node . . . e.g. simple authentication Single Sign On SSO client certificate authentication etc. . The DTEIM engine authenticates or establishes a session against the main IM node . In certain embodiments the end user has an IM account on the main IM node and on any other IM node . . . where the user wants to manage accounts.

Person modification requests by the end user are serviced by the DTEIM engine from the main IM node . After they are executed there the IM IM adapters . . . framework distributes e.g. sprays the changes to affected IM nodes . . . . If a person is added or removed from an IM node . . . the DTEIM notifier module . . . on that IM node . . . notifies the DTEIM engine and the DTEIM engine adds or removes the object stub that references the person s object on the IM node . . . from the directory server .

In certain embodiments there is person modification only on a specific IM node . . . . For such embodiments using the IM IM adapter . . . each IM node . . . is represented as a service on the main IM node . A user s person object on an IM node . . . is represented as an identity account. Using the DTEIM engine a user is able to manage this account by choosing an identity account from any IM node.

The DTEIM engine maintains object stubs for all accounts owned by a person. The DTEIM notifier . . . on an IM node . . . sends account object creation and deletion notifications to the DTEIM engine . The DTEIM engine lets a user manage accounts on all IM nodes . . . or selectively on one IM node . . . at a time.

When a provisioning request on one or more services is submitted to the DTEIM engine the DTEIM engine determines the IM node . . . that manages the service and routes the account request to the IM node . . . responsible for the service. In certain embodiments a service may be described as representing an end point i.e. a system managed by the IM node . After the request is executed there the DTEIM notifier module . . . sends notification to the DTEIM engine which creates an account stub in the DTEIM directory server . In certain embodiments simple attributes changes on account objects in IM nodes . . . are not sent back to the DTEIM object stub on the DTEIM directory server and thus they do not add to the DTEIM IM traffic.

When a user wants to view or modify existing accounts the DTEIM engine expands the account stub by accessing the IM node . . . to render account information to the end user.

The DTEIM engine distributes e.g. sprays password change requests to the target IM nodes . . . in parallel. For the user s convenience the DTEIM engine joins the password rules across the IM nodes . . . if the target accounts in the password change request are on multiple IM nodes . . .

Access information is retrieved from participating IM nodes . . . in parallel. Accesses can be retrieved provisioned or removed.

The DTEIM engine gets request information or assignment information in parallel from all the IM nodes . . . that a user participates in. In certain embodiments the DTEIM engine does not connect to the IM nodes . . . that the user does not participate in. Since the requests or assignments from multiple IM nodes . . . are retrieved in parallel the time to retrieve is only as long as the longest time to retrieve from any one IM node . . . plus a minor thread management overhead . Also assignment items can be performed in bulk across IM nodes . . . in a single action. Assignment items may be described as to do items for a participant e.g. pending approve reject items for provisioning requests for another user pending requests to provide more information on a provisioning request etc. .

In certain embodiments since the DTEIM architecture allows for a very loose coupling of IM nodes no policies roles or other configuration items are defined or configured at the DTEIM layer . IM administrators e.g. system administrators or other users configure the IM nodes . . . using current capabilities of identify management. In certain embodiments most of the configuration steps may be carried out as they would be for any IM node. This configuration includes 

The DTEIM engine provides end user functionality. In certain embodiments for decentralization administrative and configuration tasks are performed on the IM nodes . . . . In certain embodiments post office consolidation of notifications take place within the IM nodes . . . . A post office may be described as an email notice consolidation facility to combine frequent multiple email notifications to the same user into one to reduce email traffic. The post office consolidation may be a feature of the IM node and is not directly impacted by DTEIM engine . In certain embodiments provisioning policies do not target services that are in different IM nodes . . . and a separate provisioning policy is configured in each IM node . . .

In certain embodiments password and identity policies do not target service profiles if all service instances are not in the same IM node . . . . In certain alternative embodiments the password and identity policies do target service profiles if all service instances are not in the same IM node . . . and the policies are identical on each IM node . . . to avoid confusion over conflicting policies.

In certain embodiments person Access Control Items ACIs that involve an account relation are setup on the IM node . . . that hosts the service for the account. An ACI controls who has how much access to IM data. In some embodiments in which data is referenced from multiple accounts that are not on the same node the person ACI filter option is not used.

In certain embodiments a custom workflow does not use operation activities to reference services not hosted on that IM node . . . . The custom workflow is created on the one or more IM nodes . . . that host the services and related objects. In certain embodiments services may list as prerequisites other services in the same node.

The DTEIM reference UI is an end user UI. The DTEIM reference UI provides self service user functions i.e. the administration tasks are decentralized on the local IM nodes . The DTEIM reference UI is provided with the DTEIM engine to show the DTEIM functionality. In certain embodiments the DTEIM reference UI is a reference implementation of the DTEIM API. The DTEIM reference UI illustrates the use of the DTEIM API. In various embodiments other UIs can be written against the DTEIM API or the DTEIM reference UI can be used as a base to deliver a UI as per the requirements of an organization.

In certain embodiments the DTEIM reference UI uses JAVA Server Faces JSF for view processing and uses the DTEIM API to communicate with the IM nodes. The DTEIM reference UI includes source code and JAVA documentation that can be used to customize the DTEIM reference UI.

The DTEIM reference UI functionality is based on the functionality that an end user would see in the IM UI. Since the DTEIM engine is scoped for end user functions the DTEIM reference UI does not contain administrative functions. In the DTEIM architecture administrative functions are decentralized and performed directly on the IM node by the administrator.

After installation the DTEIM reference UI can be accessed by navigating to a particular location or Uniform Resource Locator URL e.g. http hostName portNumber DTEIM index.html .

The DTEIM engine displays the person information similar to the IM UI. Person form changes in IM are followed in real time by the DTEIM engine . The Personal Information tab may be rendered using an IM form definition.

The DTEIM engine provides an API that can be used by custom user interfaces or Java client applications to communicate with the DTEIM engine . The DTEIM Reference UI is an example of an external application that uses the DTEIM API.

The DTEIM API may be JAVA based. The DTEIM API provides a topology transparent API. With the DTEIM API the client does not need to be aware of the IM node distribution. The DTEIM API provides self service functions. The DTEIM API can be used by a custom UI or a JAVA client application to communicate with the DTEIM engine .

The DTEIM Data Services API represents DTEIM data objects in the DTEIM LDAP data store and provides entity and search operations.

The DTEIM Provider API provides access to DTEIM operations. The DTEIM Provider API is limited to providing end user functionality. In certain embodiments the DTEIM Provider API does not provide administrative and configuration functionality. In certain embodiments the DTEIM Provider API consists of the following providers 

The DTEIM node also provides an Enterprise JAVA Bean EJB layer interface for DTEIM administration and authentication 

The examples herein are illustrative of the DTEIM API and are not an exhaustive list of examples for the entire DTEIM API.

In certain embodiments the web service runs as a web application co located with an IM node. The web service may use a simple client and data model. Web Services Description Language WSDL files can be used to generate a web services client and data model. WSDL may be used to generate non JAVA clients. Also a pre generated JAVA client is provided in certain embodiments. The web service provides a threaded conversation by establishing a session identifier ID .

In certain embodiments the web services suite is made of functionally separate services with a single proxy fa ade 

In certain embodiments a pre generated web service client provides a web service factory class . The web service factory publishes each web service and eliminates the client s need to determine the service address. The web service factory can provide an instance of any of the IM web services. Obtaining a web service is functionally simple e.g. webServiceFactory.getWSPaswordService .

In block the main IM node uses the IM to IM adapter to send the person modification to all participating IM nodes. In block each IM node receiving the person modification updates information at that IM node. Also each IM node receiving the person changes routes the add delete suspend restore requests to the DTEIM engine .

In block the DTEIM engine receives the notification. In block the DTEIM engine adds suspends restores deletes the person object stub with the node id to the DTEIM LDAP directory server.

In block the DTEIM engine determines whether the user queried for request data. If so processing continues to block otherwise processing continues to block . In block the DTEIM engine processes the query using parallel sub queries for multiple IM nodes. Further details of the processing of the query in parallel is described with reference to .

From block processing continues to block .

In block the DTEIM engine returns to the user node aware account data combined with any request and to do data that the user may have queried for to present combined information from multiple IM nodes to the user. Thus if the user has not asked for request or to do data the user receives account data from multiple IM nodes. However if the user asked for request and or to do data the user receives combined account data and request and or to do data from multiple IM nodes. The DTEIM engine has obtained and combined existing identity management information from multiple IM nodes that this user is allowed to access prior to presenting that information.

In particular for each IM node e.g. IM node IM node . . . IM node N the processing of blocks is performed in parallel. In block the DTEIM engine determines whether the IM node X where X is any IM node . . . N is active. If so processing continues to block otherwise processing continues to block . In block the DTEIM engine adds the IM node X down result. In certain embodiments a down result indicates an IM node is down not reachable error message. From block processing continues to block .

In block the DTEIM engine determines whether the IM node X credentials are available in the credentials cache. If so processing continues to block otherwise processing continues to block . In block the DTEIM engine authenticates the credentials on the IM node X and stores the credentials in the credentials cache. From block processing continues to block .

In block the DTEIM engine combines the sub request statuses to form a provisioning request status asynchronously as IM nodes respond. In block the DTEIM engine returns a combined node aware status.

Thus the DTEIM architecture is may be used for very large identity management implementations. The DTEIM architecture makes identity management progressively scalable by deploying the identity management in a distributed topology. The DTEIM architecture increases availability by allowing staggered maintenance of the IM infrastructure improves performance supports heterogeneous versions of IMs and decentralizes administration. The decentralized model improves manageability and workload distribution.

The DTEIM architecture tracks system identities using distributed IM nodes. Each IM node can collaborate with the other IM nodes to enable configurations to the network architecture in a scalable distributed fashion.

The DTEIM architecture allows localized administration and centralized identity and account operations. The DTEIM architecture is able to provide one off provisioning for a subset of a population e.g. an isolated lab .

With the DTEIM architecture more IM nodes may be added as more services are rolled out. Since individual IMs process their own subset of services and reconciliations performance bottlenecks are avoided.
