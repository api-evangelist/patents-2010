This application claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 497 751 filed Aug. 2 2006 of which the present application is a divisional and of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 705 516 filed Aug. 4 2005 the entire contents of these two applications being incorporated by reference herein.

This invention was made with government support under grant numbers AI036357 and GM060799 EB000264 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to compounds which modulate one or more of ERalpha beta and GPR30 receptors to pharmaceutical compositions based upon those compounds and to methods of treating disease states and conditions mediated through these receptors and related methods thereof.

Estrogens mediate multiple complex physiological responses throughout the body. The responses are in turn mediated through the binding of estrogen to receptors. The classical receptors for steroids such as estrogen are soluble cytoplasmic nuclear proteins that function as transcription factors. These receptors are known as estrogen receptor alpha and beta two closely related proteins that mediate transcriptional activity as well as rapid cellular signaling. GPR30 is a 7 transmembrane G protein coupled receptor that has previously been suggested by Filardo et al. to mediate estrogen dependent signal transduction. We have recently demonstrated that GPR30 is an intracellular protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum which binds estrogen with high affinity K 6 nM and mediates rapid cellular responses including calcium mobilization and phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate production in the nucleus.

The current invention is in the field of molecular biology pharmacology and provides compounds which modulate the effects of GPR30 as well as the classical estrogen receptors alpha and beta ER and ER . These compounds may function as agonists and or antagonists of one or more of the disclosed estrogen receptors. Diseases which are mediated through one or more of these receptors include cancer particularly breast reproductive and other hormone dependent cancers leukemia colon cancer prostate cancer reproductive genito urological including endometreitis prostatitis polycystic ovarian syndrome bladder control hormone related disorders hearing disorders cardiovascular conditions including hot flashes and profuse sweating hypertension stroke obesity osteoporosis hematologic diseases vascular diseases or conditions such as venous thrombosis atherosclerosis among numerous others and disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system including depression insomnia anxiety neuropathy multiple sclerosis neurodegenerative disoders such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease as well as inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease coeliac celiac disease and related disorders of the intestine. Compounds according to the present invention may also be used as contraceptive agents to prevent or decrease the likelihood that a woman will become pregnant as a consequence of intercourse.

The invention relates to compounds which have been identified as being agonists or antagonists to one or more of these receptors and represent compounds which may be used to treat any one or more diseases or conditions which are mediated through these receptors. These compounds due to their ability to bind to GPR30 and or one or both of estrogen receptors alpha and beta are useful for the treatment or prevention of the diseases which are mediated through GPR30 and or one or both of the alpha and beta estrogen receptors.

The term optical isomer is used to describe either of two kinds of optically active 3 dimensional isomers stereoisomers . One kind is represented by minor image structures called enantiomers which result from the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. The other kind is exemplified by diastereomers which are not minor images and which contain at least two asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus such compounds have 2optical isomers where n is the number of asymmetric carbon atoms. In the present invention all optical isomers in impure i.e. as mixtures or pure or substantially pure form such as enantiomerically enriched or as separated diastereomers are contemplated by the present invention. In certain aspects the pure enantiomer or diastereomer is the preferred compound.

The three component cyclization reaction of aldehyde amine and ene components used for the synthesis of the tetrahydro 3H cyclopenta c quinoline structure of G1 and derivatives may be catalyzed by a variety of protic and Lewis acids. Scandium III triflate Sc OTf was a particularly effective catalyst for the synthesis of the derivatives included in this invention and typically provided fast reaction times and high product yields.

In general an aldehyde or ketone as pictured in the scheme presented below is added to a solutions containing an amine and optionally a third compound such as a diene or other unsaturated compound as appropriate to reflect the various substitutions on the final compound of interest. The condensation reactions proceed in the presence of catalyst in solvent at varying temperatures depending on the reactants their functional groups and the type of reaction employed. Note that the synthetic method relies in general on the use of a condensation reaction between an amine and an aldehyde or ketone depending upon the final desired compound and a subsequent simulatenous reaction to derivatize the newly formed Schiff s base or other intermediate as appropriate to produce the final compound. It is noted here that various components may be added to the general reaction scheme to produce final product and chemical steps may be added as appropriate to introduce substituents and other groups to produce final product. In certain instances blocking groups or other groups which are inactive under certain reaction conditions but which can be removed without interfering with the basic chemistry previously introduced may be used to produce compounds according to the present invention. Various modifications to the general synthetic scheme may be readily accomplished by those of ordinary skill using various well known general synthetic methods.

The general synthetic approach for construction of the tetrahydro 3H cyclopenta c quinoline scaffold is represented in Scheme I. This three component coupling procedure combines an aniline C and aldehyde A to yield an intermediate imine followed by cyclization with ene D. Initially described by Povarov 36 656 70 1967 the overall transformation can also be described formally as an aza Diels Alder reaction and may be conducted sequentially or in one step. This reaction is a versatile synthetic method that accommodates a wide variety of substituted components and can be catalyzed by protic or Lewis acids. See for example Babu and Perumal P. T. 1998 54 1627 38 1998 Ma et al. 64 6462 7 1999 Crousse et al 16 5009 13 2000 Collin et al. 42 7405 7 2001 Yadav et al. 59 1599 604 2003 Powell et al . 4 2913 6 2002 Zhang and Li 67 3969 71 2002 Chen and Li 5 627 9 2003 Li et al. 44 153 6 2003 Powell and Batey 44 7569 73 2003 Yadav et al 2 240 2 2001 Twin and Batey 6 4913 6 2004 Akiyama et al. 33 922 3 2004 Nagarajan et al. 1 69 74 2004 Kumar et al. 6 949 59 2004 Hermitage et al. 2 2451 60 2004 Tolstikov et al. 16 605 12 2005 Hadden et al. 62 3977 84 2006 Ramesh et al. 36 1431 6 2006 . The resulting G scaffold contains three stereogenic centers however the syn or endo diastereomers are typically fowled with high selectivity and exhibit a characteristic 1H NMR coupling pattern of the B ring hydrogen atoms that can be easily recognized.

By way of example a solution of the catalyst Sc OTf 49.2 mg 0.10 mmol 10 mol in anhydrous acetonitrile 0.4 mL was added to the mixture of aldehyde A 1 mmol amine C 1 mmol and ene D 5 mmol in acetonitrile 4 mL The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature 23 C. and the progress was monitored by thin layer chromatography. Reaction times typically ranged from 0.5 hr to 5 hr for completion. The reaction mixture was worked up by removal of solvent and other volatiles by evaporation under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by preparative column chromatography using silica gel SiO eluted with EtOAc hexane polar phase composition 5 30 EtOAc depending on product Rf . The fractions containing pure product were evaporated in vacuo. The structural identity and purity were characterized by spectroscopic methods H and C NMR FT IR and HPLC MS UV. Compound G1 can be readily synthesized in this manner.

Complete characterization of the structural features responsible for G 1 binding affinity to GPR30 is achieved through the synthesis of selected cyclopenta c quinolines. We recently prepared G 1 on a multigram scale and resolved the two syn enantiomers using chiral reverse phase preparative HPLC. Additional screening and activation studies enable correlation of receptor biology with the absolute enantiomeric configuration of G 1. The isolation of the minor G 1 anti diastereomer is accomplished using SmIcatalyst. These conditions typically yield increased relative amounts of the anti stereoisomer Collin et al. 42 7405 7 2001 and we have found that G 1 anti is produced in 10 yield and can be isolated by preparative HPLC. Additional selected members of the G 1 series include the oxidized derivative G 1B ox that is prepared by controlled oxidation of G 1 with MnO See Lucchini et al. 23 1135 9 1986 and the quinoline GB ox2 that will be obtained by alkene isomerization and oxidation Fadel et al. 45 5905 8 1986 . These compounds will help to elucidate the role of the B ring nitrogen in potential hydrogen bonding and how altered planarity of the cyclopenta c quinoline affects interactions with the receptor.

Variations of the identity and substitution pattern of functional groups on the A ring are predicted to significantly affect GPR30 binding affinity and activation profiles. The library of G derivatives will include the compounds illustrated in . Cleavage of the dioxolane group of G 1 with AlClwill provide the catechol GA 1 Reitz et al. 46 4859 63 1981 . The free phenol GA 2 and methoxy derivative GA 3 will be prepared by three component coupling with p hydroxybenzaldehyde. Replacement of the bromide substituent of G 1 with lithium dimethylcuprate will provide the methyl derivative GA 4. Palladium catalyzed Suzuki or Sonogashira coupling procedures with G 1 will provide alkene GA 5 aryl derivative GA 7 and the alkyne GA 6 respectively. Protection of the amine may be necessary to avoid cyclopalladation of the benzylic amine under these conditions and can be accomplished by formation of the trifluoroacetamide. We have extensive experience with these types of C C coupling reactions and heterocyclic amine substrates. Benzofuran GA 8 benzothiophene GA 9 and coumarin GA 11 derivatives will be synthesized from the corresponding aldehydes in the Povarov cyclization. Triazole GA 10 will be prepared by azide cycloaddition to alkyne GA 6. This series of A ring substituted derivatives will probe the steric and electronic features of GPR30 binding and activation and is expected to yield valuable information for SAR QSAR analyses that will enable the development of potent GPR30 antagonists.

Structural modification of the cyclopenta c quinoline moiety of the G scaffold is also expected to significantly affect GPR30 binding affinity. The reduced affinity was observed from increasing the steric volume of ring D as discussed above. We will investigate the effect of increasing the polarity by introducing an oxygen atom into the D ring . The tetrahydro furan derivative GD 1 will be synthesized from the three component cyclization with 2 3 dihydrofuran. The homologated sterically larger 6 membered ring tetrahydropyran GD 2 will be prepared analogously from the dihydropyran. Replacement of the D ring with ketone in GD 3 will be accomplished by cyclization with p methoxybenzyl vinyl ether followed by deprotection and oxidation. This compound will also provide opportunities for diversification through nucleophilic additions alkene formation enolate alkylation and reductive amination chemistry. The effect of increased flexibility will be evaluated by eliminating the B ring in compound GD 4. This derivative will be synthesized by indium mediated addition of iodocyclopentane to the corresponding imine that we have used in the synthesis of G 1 Miyabe et al. 60 4227 35 2004 .

The compounds identified as synthetic targets in this section represent the first iteration of structural modifications for the purpose of identifying structure activity relationships of the G scaffold and GPR30 binding and activation. Our initial studies have identified this tetracyclic core as a promising scaffold for optimization of GPR30 binding and activation that is distinguished from classical estrogen receptors. This investigation will use the results from the first series of synthetic G derivatives to characterize the GPR30 binding interactions of G 1 and identify initial leads directed towards antagonism. It is important to emphasize that these synthetic objectives will be achieved through extensive interaction with the computational and screening components of this investigation. The input from the ligand based virtual screening approach and the developing QSAR model will focus our efforts to synthesize additional series of GPR30 antagonists that maintain selectivity over ER subtypes of at least 3 orders of magnitude. These design considerations will also include input from medicinal chemistry that prioritizes structures with promising drug like properties of adsorption distribution metabolism and excretion. Additional considerations beyond the well recognized rule of 5 associate favorable characteristics of drugs with 0 2 hydrogen bond donors 2 9 hydrogen bond acceptors 1 4 rings and 2 8 rotatable bonds T. Oprea 14 251 64 2004 . Compound solubility is determined using a flow cytometric approach that uses light scatter to measure particulates. The progression of this investigation provides opportunities for scaffold hopping to follow active leads with structures that deviate significantly from our initial lead G 1.

In order to identify a pharmacophore and compounds according to the present invention the following binding assay was performed using a library of compounds.

The binding assay is carried out as follows. COST cells transfected to express either nuclear estrogen receptor ER GFP or GPR30 GFP are serum starved for 24 h before the assay. Cells are treated with 2 nM E2 Alexa 633 diluted in permeabilization buffer 0.025 saponin 5 mM EGTA 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgClin 80 mM piperazine N N bis 2 ethane sulfonic acid KOH pH 6.8 for 10 min at 37 C. The cells are fixed with chilled 2 PFA in PBS with 1 mM CaCland 1 mM MgClfor 15 mM at 37 C. For flow cytometric analysis of E2 Alexa 633 binding to GPR30 GFP or ER GFP expressing cells the cells are washed once with PBS and analyzed on FACS Calibur using Cell Quest. Nonspecific binding is determined in presence of 1 M 17 estradiol. Competition binding is carried out in the presence of the appropriate concentration of compound that is pre incubated with the cells for 10 min prior to permeabilization.

TFA 1.52 g was added dropwise to a solution of p aminoacetophenone 2.0 g in acetonitrile. Freshly distilled cyclopentadiene 3.91 g was added followed by the bromosubstiuted aldehyde 3.39 g . The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and the product was isolated from an aliquot of the mixture by preparative HPLC acetonitrile in water gradient 0.05 TFA .

The following compound was found to exhibit selective binding to GPR30 and not estrogen receptor alpha or beta . The Ki was in the 10M range. This compound activates multiple activities of GPR30 in the nM range.

The following two compounds were found to exhibit selective binding to estrogen receptor alpha and not to GPR30 . The Ki values were in the 10 10M range. Both of these compounds fail to activate rapid estrogen receptor alpha beta signaling block rapid estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor alpha beta and therefore function as antagonists of rapid signaling.

Based upon the above attempts were made to derivatize the basic compounds presented above to produce compounds according to the present invention.

In order to understand the interactions of novel ligands with GPR30 we determine whether and how such compounds mediate receptor activation through GPR30. Multiple assays including calcium mobilization PI3kinase activation EGFR phosphorylation transcriptional activation migration and proliferation are used to assess cellular signaling through GPR30 in response to treatment with estrogen derivatives in order to confirm membrane permeability and determine whether the compounds act as agonists or antagonists. Through these studies we gain a better understanding of the structure activity relationships related to GPR30 function and reveal whether compounds display partial or selective agonism antagonism of SERM like properties. These results help assist further design of active compounds.

We have demonstrated that cells transfected to express only GPR30 or one of the classical estrogen receptors ER or ER respond to estrogen stimulation with rapid calcium mobilization. This assay utilizes real time fluorescence measurements of indol AM calcium sensitive fluorophore loaded cells providing a real time analysis of receptor function. This approach also allows us to examine the cellular permeability of the compounds since the screening was carried out in permeabilized cells . For example in the case of our novel GPR30 specific ligand G 1 we observed that the kinetics of cellular activation were slower than those for estrogen . This could be due to slower uptake of the ligand in to the cell slower binding to the receptor as compared to estrogen or slower activation of the signaling response once bound to the receptor. Nevertheless the result demonstrates a half time for activation by G 1 of approximately 30 sec suggesting that in this time frame a significant amount of ligand has entered the cell bound to the receptor and activated downstream effectors. Such rapid kinetic analyses along with dose responses will be important in assessing the cellular permeability of the many compounds to be screened and synthesized. Although equilibrium binding measurements using permeabilized cells will indicate whether a competitor can displace the reporter over time 5 15 min only this assay can easily and effectively estimate the rapidity seconds time scale with which compounds cross the cell membrane.

In addition to calcium mobilization we have monitored GPR30 mediated activation of multiple kinases including PI3K and EGFR. Activation of these proteins measured by PH reporter translocation and anti phospho EGFR antibody binding respectively occurs on a slower timescale 5 15 min than calcium mobilization. Nevertheless these assays represent important tests of receptor function as some compounds may elicit specific activation events through GPR30 to the exclusion of others.

Estrogen is best known for its ability to regulate transcription through binding to classical ERs. Using ERE based luciferase reporter assays we have demonstrated that the G 1 compound for example does not activate transcription of the ERE reporter plasmid where estrogen itself yields a robust response not shown . This assay which assesses activity on an hour day basis reveals the ability of compounds according to the present invention to activate transcription through classical estrogen receptors a much more sensitive assay potentially than ligand binding . Understanding multiple aspects of signaling initiated by novel compounds will provide important structure activity relationship data that will feed back into the design of subsequent compounds.

In addition to transfected cells which express high levels of the transfected receptor we also assess receptor function in endometrial and breast cancer cells. Hec50 human endometrial cancer and SKBr3 breast cancer cells are both deficient in classical ER expression both ER and ER and have therefore frequently been termed estrogen unresponsive. Our data however shows that both of these cell lines express GPR30 and respond to estrogen exclusively through this receptor as demonstrated by the lack of estrogen signaling in cells transfected with GPR30 antisense constructs . To confirm the activity of novel compounds observed in transfected cells selected experiments e.g. PI3K activation ERK EGFR phosphorylation are repeated and extended in cells expressing endogenous GPR30.

In addition to molecular interactions it is necessary to characterize how the novel synthetic compounds as well as compounds derived from biomolecular screening modulate cellular functions. Our preliminary data suggest that G 1 may exert regulatory effects on cell growth and or apoptosis as well as migration Bologa et al. 2 207 12. 2006 . Thus an anticipated outcome of this research may be the development of GPR30 specific compounds that can be used as chemotherapeutic agents in addition to their use as tools to probe GPR30 biology and physiology. Examples of cellular assays are provided below.

Both transfected cells expressing exclusively GPR30 or ER ER and cells expressing only endogenous receptors SKBr3 or MCF7 cells are used to determine the effects of novel compounds on cell viability parameters. Cell based studies are performed using charcoal coated dextran treated serum to deplete all steroids from the medium. Cells are washed 4 5 times and cultured in this minimal medium for greater than 24 hours prior to use. Growth rate experiments are carried out in the presence or absence of the compound to be tested and compared to replenishment conditions where estrogen and other steroids have been restored to the medium. Effects are evaluated following 2 4 days incubation by crystal violet staining to determine increases in cell number. Induction of apoptosis is evaluated using AnnexinV propidium iodide staining.

Migration assays are carried out using 6.5 mm Transwell chambers with an 8 m pore size filter Costar Corning Inc. . The undersurface of the filter is coated overnight at 4 C. with approximately 50 g ml rat tail collagen and washed with PBS. DMEM F12 600 l supplemented with 10 FBS 10 ng ml of EGF and 10 g ml of insulin is added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. SKBr3 or MCF7 cells 75 000 cells in serum free DMEM F12 150 l are treated with ethanol control 17 estradiol or test compound for 15 min at 37 C. prior to loading in the upper chamber. Following incubation for 48 hours at 37 C. the remaining cells were wiped from the upper surface of the membrane with a damp cotton swab. The migrated cells on the undersurface of the membrane are fixed with 2 paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 crystal violet. Quantitation of cells is performed by counting the number of cells field in 5 random fields per membrane and migration is calculated as migration number of cells in treated number of cells in ethanol control 100.

Some of the compounds according to the present invention exhibit activity in some cellular assays but not others. This is similar in concept to the idea of SERMs or the increasing number of GPCR ligands that selectively activate only a subset of effectors pathways a phenomenon termed agonist trafficking Kenakin 24 346 54 2003 and Vaquelin and Van Liefde 19 45 56. 2005 . As opposed to being a pitfall this activity results in adding to the depth of the structure activity analyses and understanding of GPR30 function.
