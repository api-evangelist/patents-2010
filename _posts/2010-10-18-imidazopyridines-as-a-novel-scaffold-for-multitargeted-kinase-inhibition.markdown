This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 257 120 filed Nov. 2 2009 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using the compounds.

Numerous human diseases are characterized by increased and uncontrolled cell growth. This biology is driven in many cases by increased growth factor signaling. In addition these pathologies often require an expanding blood supply and new vessel growth. Protein kinases are key components of both cell proliferation and endothelial cell expansion. Kinases are thus important targets for therapeutic intervention in pathologies characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.

Geometric isomers may exist in the present compounds. Compounds of this invention may contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration wherein the term E represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term Z represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn Ingold Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples see C. D. Jones M. Kaselj R. N. Salvatore W. J. le Noble 1998 63 2758 2760.

Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed hydroxyl amino or carboxylic acid in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Compounds of this invention can exist in an isotopic form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C P S F Cl and I respectively. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Compounds containing tritium H and C radioisotopes are preferred in general for their ease in preparation and detectability for radiolabeled compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotopically labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes herein by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.
