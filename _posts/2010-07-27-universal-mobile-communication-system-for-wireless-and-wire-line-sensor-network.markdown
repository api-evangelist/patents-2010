The present invention relates to a communication system in particular to a universal mobile communication system.

Presently the mobile phone networking systems tend to increase their communication bandwidth continuously for example the 3G and 4G mobile phone network. The providers of mobile phone service content tend to increase the size of data service such as video on demand and video conferencing in order to fully utilize the abundant bandwidth provided by the mobile phone networking system and the manufacturers of the mobile phones tend to increase the computation power of the mobile phones in order to decode the bandwidth hungry content provided by the providers.

In most situations however a user may only require a small amount of information thus more cost effective and low data rate communication is sufficient. In the event that the user enters a particular location such as a shop or a restaurant which is located within a larger establishment such as a shopping mall a hotel or a car parking facility the required data rate bandwidth for information retrieval may be substantially reduced and a sensor network may be well suited for this kind of application.

The MCD is a wireless mobile communications device which may comprise a master body and a slave body communication circuitry which depending upon various situations may comprise more than one slave body device coupled to the same master body. The master body is a wireless device which depending on different situations may comprise a display a set input keys or buttons a pedometer a vibration sensor a vibrator a loudspeaker and or buzzer some LEDs a microphone a USB port a communication port a Wi Fi circuit and a Bluetooth circuit. The slave body is a waterproof wireless device which may likewise comprise the same listing of components as the master body.

In embodiments employing outdoor applications the master body and the slave body may connect together as a single device and the slave body is idle. And under some other applications once it is detached from the master body the slave body may be active and communicate with the master body through wireless transmissions. A better understanding of the functions of the master body and the slave body may be gleaned from the following description.

The display is for showing instant information such as ready alerts security alerts daily alerts service requests battery level of the MCD and signal level of the sensor network.

The input keys are for initiating selected or required instant information service requests and the like and operating in an alarm state such as panic alarm service bell etc. .

The pedometer is for sensing and or recording the step profile of the user e.g. number of steps step amplitude step frequency period step regularity etc. . This function may work as a stand alone product feature and also may operate normally and independently when the MCD is out of the transmission coverage area of the sensor network and or when the MCD itself is offline i.e. not operatively coupled to internet through a PC or some other networking devices.

The vibration sensor is for sensing recording the movement patterns of the user . This function may work as a stand alone feature product and operate normally and independently when the MCD is out of the coverage area of the sensor network or when offline.

The vibrator and loudspeaker are for alerting the user to new instant information and or alerts e.g. ready alerts security alerts daily alerts service requests etc. .

When the MCD is out of the coverage area of the sensor network or offline and the slave body is detached from the master body the slave body may continuously send the sensed vibration or movement data button status data etc. to the master body through wireless communication. Under this sort of sensor networking configuration many applications may be supported. For example 

 1 anti property theft application e.g. after activating the anti theft feature the slave body which is attached to the property to be protected may send an anti property theft security alert to the master body to alert the user who is in possession of the master body that the property being protected is under abnormal movement and requires more attention to keep the property safe 

 2 movement habit and or voice pattern recognition application e.g. the user may register the movement habit and or voice pattern to the MCD afterwards once the registered movement habit and or voice pattern occurs the MCD may send an alert to the user or other personnel through the MCD SMS mobile phone etc. and

 3 other kinds of remote sensing control depending on applications. All the aforesaid features may work as a stand alone feature product and operate normally and independently when the MCD is out of the coverage area of the sensor network or is offline.

The MCD may record the transaction data of the user e.g. shopping records car vehicle parking duration parking lot number bonuses or specials access rights e ticket e coupon and the food that the user takes in the restaurant etc.

The MCD may record the output of the pedometer and vibration sensor of the user . When the master body is within the coverage area of the sensor network or is online and the slave body is detached from the master body the slave body may continuously send the sensed vibration movement data and button status data to the master body through wireless communication. Many applications may be supported with such a configuration. For example 

 1 panic alarm application e.g. for elderly people or disabled or other compromised persons requiring assistance for urgent help by pressing a button on the slave body and then the master body may send security alert to pre defined personnel through the MCD SMS mobile phone etc. 

 3 no movement alert application e.g. to protect the elderly disabled or other compromised persons if an accident happens. If the master body senses that the slave body which is carried held by or attached to a user who has no normal movement e.g. breathing movement heart movement or other biological indicators for a pre defined period of time the master body may send a security alert to pre defined personnel through the MCD SMS mobile phone etc. and

 4 login application e.g. the user may hold the slave body and perform a series of movements and a movement code may be generated in terms of amplitude frequency relative movements or other movement quantifiers. Afterwards once a movement s code matches the registered movement code the master body may pass this movement code to a relative hardware device and or software application e.g. PC web site etc and the hardware device and or software application may recognize the code as a valid login information and admit the login automatically.

All the aforesaid features may work as stand alone features and or products and may operate normally and independently when the MCD is out of the coverage area of sensor network or is offline mode . And it can be appreciated that a pattern recognition system may replace the vibration sensor to detect the movement of the user so that the user may be automatically logged into a hardware device and or software application without carrying or holding the MCD or slave body .

The MCD may comprise a communication port e.g. USB port to connect with internet. While online the MCD may connect to the communication portal for data upload such as transaction data step data vibration sensor data etc. for selected data download such as instant information ready alert security daily alert service request etc for software upgrade for battery charging and for serving as a fixed sensor node as a few non exhaustive examples.

The MCD may serve as a wireless access control key to open a door an entrance or a turnstile at a specified time date and period of enabled facilities in paid free area such as estate club house club hotel resort etc. The access right of the MCD may be configured by an administrator through the communication portal and the system for access right control may connect to a Customer Relationship Management CRM system for providing better service to the user .

The MCD may serve as an e ticket or an electronic payment device to facilities such as a club house a club a hotel a resort a disco a cinema a park transportations a vending machine etc. The access right of the MCD may be configured by an administrator through the communication portal .

The MCD may serve as a redemption mechanism for tender such as e coupons e cash coupons e package coupons and the like. The redemption may be for services at specified times dates or periods. The e coupon rights of the MCD may be configured by an administrator through the communication portal .

The MCD may serve as a membership card a personal record card or a medical card in order to reduce the number of cards personnel has to carry when he she goes out.

The MCD may allow the user to reply to simple questions e.g. after receiving the ready alert from restaurants the user may select acceptance or rejection about a choice by simply selecting y or n . Furthermore the MCD may enable the user to answer simple multiple choice questions e.g. surveys.

The MCD may communicate with the home TV set top box and treat the home TV set top box as a fixed sensor node .

The MCD may have an unlocking feature e.g. the user may hold the MCD and perform a series of movements and a movement code may be generated in terms of amplitude frequency relative movements etc. If the movement code matches the registered movement code of a switch or a lock the switch or lock may recognize the code as valid unlocking information and the switch or lock may be unlocked automatically at a specified time date and period. Also the user may unlock the switch or lock by pressing a button on the MCD . If the MCD s ID number matches the registered and or required ID code of the switch or lock the switch lock may be unlocked automatically at specified time date and period. In order to enable the switch or lock to accept the ID number only a simple and inexpensive hardware circuit needs to be installed into the switch or lock. The right to unlock and provide access by the MCD may be configured by an administrator through the communication portal . It should be understood that all the above features may work as a stand alone feature product and operate normally and independently when it is out of the coverage area of sensor network or in offline mode .

The MCD may support many group applications. For example 1 group communication e.g. in a journey the guide may broadcast a message such as change of gathering location or time etc. or calling all particular members of the tour group back or informative communications as such. Also the guide may receive replies from the members 2 group matching e.g. a group of students or persons wanting to pair up randomly they may put all the slave bodies together and everyone just keeps the master body then everyone may draw select a slave body randomly. Afterwards everyone may press the button on the slave bodies and the corresponding master body may light up and or vibrate to match with the slave body and thus the pair up task may be completed easily 3 group voting e.g. during a concert TV show at home disco seminar or class etc. the host may collect a survey or voting data to determine the final song the audiences required the last episode TV show ending selection or the examination date and the host may just ask the related audiences to answer some simple questions so that the host may make decisions according to the results 4 group arrival status e.g. a student person may view on the display to find if the registered users have arrived at the specified location e.g. classroom cinema etc. and 5 other kinds of group operations depending on applications. The above features 2 5 may work as a stand alone features and or products and operate normally and independently when it is out of the coverage area of the sensor network or in offline mode .

Simplified versions of the MCD e.g. small display size small device size without slave body etc. may be implemented to collect the user s instant score on provided food services for statistical purpose. For example a simplified version of MCD e.g. a tag with small display and input keys may be attached with each item of food dish. After having food dish the user may express his her enjoyment level about the food dish and give marks by pressing the input keys and the data may be automatically collected by the fixed sensor node and be used internally e.g. used by shop owner or administration staff for performance review or be used exteriorly e.g. published through the communication portal for sharing or recommendation etc.

Exemplary types of Service request in the present Universal Mobile Communication System may be as follows 

Ticket or Reservation Service requests e.g. for restaurant salon pharmacy fitting changing room and other service providers which require issuing ticket for queue up. Once the ticket number is nearly ready a Ready alert will be sent to the corresponding MCD user 

Take away Service requests e.g. for fast food shops coffee shops etc. For example when a MCD user wants to buy a cup of coffee or fast food when traveling the MCD user could make an order on the MCD . Upon coffee food shop confirmation an order number will be displayed on the MCD . When the MCD user arrives at the station the coffee or food is ready to take away. The MCD user could use the order number shown on the MCD to take away the ordered coffee food. The payment could be made in present or electronically 

Staff Calling Service request the users can use the MCDs to 1 call staff to come to his her location to serve him her and 2 serve as a panic alarm to ask for assistance if such service is available at the location 

All other services that could enable the MCD user to make order or reservation in advance and then enjoy the service when the user arrive later or at the specified time or date.

A better understanding of the present Universal Mobile Communication System will be obtained from the following detailed description about a car parking lot application.

There are two kinds of Car Registration Operations car park registration and the parking lot registration. It is to be understood that the term car may also include any type of vehicle that can be transited and stored in and outside of a parking lot scenario.

As shown in during a car park registration a car or vehicle enters or exits a drop bar of a car park. The car park is equipped with the Universal Mobile Communication System and a set of Sensor nodes which may communicate and record the MCD s identity number. The parking in time and parking period may also be recorded and shown on the MCD . An operation flow chart of this process is shown in .

As illustrated in parking lot registration may transpire after a driver or user parks a car in a parking lot. The driver or user may register the car at that parking lot by pointing the MCD to the Sensor node to facilitate communication transmissions to initiate registration in the parking. The registration is completed when the sensor node replies with an indicator alert. The operation flow chart of this process is shown in .

When a driver who is in the car park or other places within the sensor network coverage area wants to know the way to go back to the registered parking lot the driver may simply point the MCD which in this embodiment serves as a Locator to any Sensor node Mobile Kiosk or Mobile Display using input keys of the MCD . The parking lot location such as direction and displacement may then be shown on the display of the MCD . In some embodiments a detailed graphical map may also be shown on the display of the Mobile Kiosk or the Mobile Display . The operation flow chart illustrating the process of locating a parked car vehicle is shown in .

A driver may select the anti auto theft mode on the Mobile Communicator Device for facilitating security features of the UMCS . Under this operation modality when the anti auto theft mode activated car leaves its registered parking lot the Backend Server may monitor the car location status. If the car exits the drop bar without the associated MCD data a Security alert may be sent to the MCD and the MCD registered phone number to inform the user of the situation. If the car leaves its registered parking lot but not exits the drop bar over a pre defined tolerance a Security alert may also be sent to the MCD and the MCD registered phone number to inform the user of the situation. The Anti Car Theft Operation flow chart of this process is shown in .

When a person wants to know the way to go to a particular shop location he she may select the desired shop location on the Mobile Kiosk . The way to the desired shop location will be shown on the display of the Mobile Kiosk . If the person has a MCD the guiding information would also be sent and shown on the MCD . The operational flowchart of this process is shown in .

When a landlord tenant administrative personnel and or receptionist during his her work observes abnormal situations he she may immediately input the abnormalities through the hand held Mobile Administration Device and the Universal Mobile Communication System may then notify pre defined persons and trigger pre defined alerts. The operational flowchart of this process is shown in .

It should be understood that in order to enhance the network coverage area of the Universal Mobile Communication System to increase the MCD s portability and to facilitate the extendibility and flexibility of the Universal Mobile Communication System application developments future developments of the Universal Mobile Communication System are suggested as follows.

Besides the original wireless and wire line sensor network coverage area in order to enhance the coverage area of the Universal Mobile Communication System to facilitate launching more comprehensive applications the following networks are suggested to be integrated into the Universal Mobile Communication System 

Mobile phone networks e.g. GSM network PCS network 3G network 4G network satellite network etc. other communication networks e.g. Octopus related networking Near Field Communication related network Wi Fi network wireless wired LAN walkie talkie network patrolling network GPS network RFID network other sensor network low frequency communication network other small area and or large area covered networks.

Originally the MCD is designed as a portable individual device. However presently many people carry numerous electronic devices such as mobile phones portable gaming devices e.g. PSP Nintendo DS music player e.g. iPod Notebook computer and the like. The electronic carrying device burden of a person is already too heavy. Under this consideration in order to improve the portability of the MCD i.e. to avoid the user from carrying so many electronic devices at a time when he she goes out the following electronic devices are suggested to be embedded in the circuitry of the MCD so that at least the display and input keys of the following devices may be shared Mobile phone iPod iPhone Netbook Portable Wireless broadband devices Walkie talkie Patrolling devices GPS devices Electronic payment related devices e.g. Near field communication related devices Octopus related devices etc RFID related devices Other sensor network related devices Memory sticks voice recording devices portable game devices and Other portable network devices.

The application development extension in the Universal Mobile Communication System is simple. By taking advantage of the Communication portal released software e.g. released API etc. and released standardized hardware e.g. fixed wireless wire line sensor node and Mobile Wireless Sensor Node Input Device an interested party may develop its own application by simple software configurations and hardware registrations. This arrangement may highly improve and encourage different parties to join in the Universal Mobile Communication System development. In such a way the Universal Mobile Communication System applications may become more comprehensive the Communication portal may have higher accessing rate and the Universal Mobile Communication System related hardware may have higher utilization.
