With the advent of computers interactive electronic communications and the Internet as well as advances in the digital realm of consumer information has come a reinvention of conventional entertainment and communication services to enhance programming recording and viewing of multimedia such as broadcast television programs. Traditionally broadcast media being based on pre computer age technology has developed on its own path without any regard to other media systems. With readily available cost effective broadband services bandwidth intensive applications such as audio and video streaming have become viable mediums. Unfortunately little or no effort has been put forth to converge these distinct paths or enable seamless integration between traditional broadcast systems and broadband data networks to provide more robust content delivery systems.

Therefore there is a need for an approach that can efficiently and effectively provide content aggregation in support of virtual channels.

A preferred apparatus method and software for providing content aggregation in support of virtual channels are described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.

Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to a set top box STB it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any device capable of processing content e.g. audio video AV signals for presentation to a user such as a home communication terminal HCT a digital home communication terminal DHCT a stand alone personal video recorder PVR a television set a digital video disc DVD player a video enabled phone an audio video enabled personal digital assistant PDA and or a personal computer PC as well as other like technologies and customer premises equipment CPE .

It is observed that television remains the prevalent global medium for accessing entertainment and information based content sources as individuals spend a great deal of time tuning into televised media. Traditionally television and radio programming has been limited to broadcast media sources e.g. media programs acquired over the air or via cable provider networks. Consumers however are being continually exposed to an ever increasing amount and variety of content accessible via other delivery systems or infrastructures such as via one or more data networks e.g. the Internet. Further with the advent of high speed data networking connections it is not uncommon for consumers to add to this body of available content by publishing libraries of end user originated content which is typically made available at for instance hosting sites such as audio video and image sharing sites. In fact the growing popularity of posting or otherwise sharing content has given rise to entire industries permitting users to upload and make homemade content available via data networks and associated digital media devices. Not surprisingly the consumer segment is being driven at least in part by a pervasive desire for access to a wide array of content in an on demand fashion.

For example internet protocol television IPTV service providers currently offer subscribers various content based services ranging from multi channel video programming that mimics traditional broadcast television to true video on demand VOD programming. These services are further supplemented with interactive video applications that enable robust programming information selection and navigation functionality as well as integrated digital video recording and data services that enhance the video experience. Even though these shared protocols create integrated value propositions with regard to content accessibility consumers are becoming rather accustomed to the tool set of the Internet to pull customized content when desired as opposed to receiving pushed content from linear broadcast sources or accessing on demand content made available by traditional content producers based on their availability schedules. Thus service providers such as IPTV service providers seeking to maximize average revenue per subscriber must look toward the synergistic characteristics of these two content providing infrastructures to leverage upon the streaming services traditionally limited to the data domains in order to advance the availability of content and associated services offered through conventional television based infrastructures. In adopting these advancements however the media industry faces a number of challenges hindering the convergence of broadband rich data content e.g. traditional internet protocol IP based content with television infrastructures.

Subsequently it is recognized that convenient access to third party content provider systems will inevitably pave the way for new value added services made available through conventional broadcast content provider infrastructures. Thus the approach of system according to certain exemplary embodiments stems from the recognition that consumers can benefit from ability to experience via for instance STB based environments content that has been traditionally limited to the data domains such as multimedia content. Little attention however has been afforded to extending and enhancing the accessibility of content within the entertainment arena as well as among other commutations media. It is therefore apparent that improvements are needed to provide consumers with the ability to experience various forms of content the way they want at any time they desire using those devices designed to maximize the multimedia experience.

As such system includes service provider network that is configured to integrate television based media with that of the telecommunications computing and associated media environments thereby broadening the scope of sources and technology available to consumers for obtaining media and or multimedia content hereinafter collectively referred to as media content. In this manner system relieves network operators from the burden and expense of providing parallel avenues to content by enabling users via any suitable content processing device e.g. an STB to receive media content traditionally accessible over a data network such as the Internet through one or more dynamically provisioned virtual channels.

According to exemplary embodiments media manager which is implemented by content processing device includes one or more computer program instructions or code that may be stored to for example one or more computer readable mediums e.g. one or more memories not shown of content processing device that when executed by for example one or more processors not illustrated of content processing device are configured to cause content processing device at least to present content streamed from one or more third party sources e.g. third party content provider system content repository etc. available over one or more data networks by for instance media agent . In this manner media agent which may be implemented by computing device may also include one or more computer program instructions or code that may be stored to for instance one or more computer readable mediums e.g. one or more memories not illustrated of computing device that when executed by for example one or more processors not shown of computing device are configured to cause computing device to retrieve content from the one or more third party sources such as third party content provider system content repository and the like and stream the retrieved content to media manager for presentation via content processing device . It is noted that media agent may be configured to transcode or otherwise convert the retrieved content from a first format to a second format before or during streaming of the retrieved content to content processing device . This stream of content is referred to herein as a virtual channel of content.

In other exemplary embodiments media manager and or media agent may when executed by for instance the one or more respective processors of content processing device and or computing device be configured to cause content processing device and or computing device to enable users to interface with platform in order to easily effectively and intuitively locate and specify media content accessible over one or more data networks for presentation via content processing device as one or more virtual channels of content. Still further media manager and or media agent may when executed by for instance the one or more respective processors of content processing device and or computing device be configured to cause content processing device and or computing device to enable users to access and thereby interact with one or more features associated with subscriber accounts corresponding to these third party content provider systems . As such embodiments of the service provider network may also enable individuals utilizing content processing devices to interact with one another through personalized communications channels to further facilitate the processes described herein. It is noted that media manager and media agent are described in more detail in association with .

As used herein media content broadly includes any audio visual content e.g. broadcast television programs VOD programs pay per view programs IPTV feeds DVD related content etc. pre recorded media content data communication services content e.g. commercials advertisements videos movies songs images sounds etc. Internet services content streamed audio video or image media and or any other equivalent media form. In this manner MSP may provide in addition to their own media content content obtained from sources such as one or more television broadcast systems one or more third party content provider systems content residing in a networked repository etc. as well as content available via one or more data networks or telephony networks etc.

MSP can provide media content that is retrieved over data network s as well as provide conventional media streams. For instance MSP may provide virtual channels to content traditionally limited to third party content provider systems such as host sites e.g. end user originated content uploaded to and thereby shared via audio video and or image sharing sites. Additionally the media content may include streamed audio and or video from conventional broadcast providers.

Media manager and media agent may be executable for example as one or more user interfaces capable of local implementation on content processing device or on a computing device such as a computer telephony device mobile device and or any other like user device. Thus exemplary embodiments of media manager and media agent may be provided through navigation shell applications e.g. menu applications having options corresponding to different functions. By way of example computer devices may include desktop computers notebook computers servers terminal workstations gaming systems customized hardware or other equivalent apparatus. Telephony devices may comprise plain old telephones wireless telephones cellular telephones satellite telephones voice over internet protocol telephones and the like. Mobile devices may include personal digital assistants PDA pocket personal computers smart phones tablets handsets portable gaming systems and customized hardware as well as other mobile technologies capable transmitting data. Moreover content processing device may be used alone or in combination with one or more computing devices to implement various exemplary embodiments.

Content processing devices and or computing device may be configured to communicate using one or more of networks and . These systems can include a public data network e.g. the Internet various intranets local area networks LAN wide area networks WAN the public switched telephony network PSTN integrated services digital networks ISDN other private packet switched networks or telephony networks as well as any additional equivalent system or combination thereof. These networks may employ various access technologies including cable networks satellite networks subscriber television networks digital subscriber line DSL networks optical fiber networks hybrid fiber coax networks worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX networks wireless fidelity WiFi networks other wireless networks e.g. 3G wireless broadband networks mobile television networks radio networks etc. terrestrial broadcasting networks provider specific networks e.g. fiber optic networks cable networks etc and the like. Such networks may also utilize any suitable protocol supportive of data communications e.g. transmission control protocol TCP internet protocol IP file transfer protocol FTP telnet hypertext transfer protocol HTTP hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS asynchronous transfer mode ATM socket connections Ethernet frame relay and the like to connect content processing devices to various sources of media content such as one or more third party content provider systems . Although depicted in as separate networks data network and or telephony network may be completely or partially contained within service provider network . For example service provider network may include facilities to provide for transport of packet based and or telephony communications.

By way of example content processing devices as well as computing device may be configured to remotely access one or more servers not shown via corresponding communication interfaces not illustrated that are configured to execute multiple instances of either media manager or media agent . That is these media applications may be provided in a distributed fashion using for instance client server architectures such as implemented by enterprise application service providers ASP . It is noted that ASP models and other like architectures offer system scalability in terms of administrative scalability geographic scalability and or load scalability. Thus distributed environments are attractive modes for disseminating system functionality to a broad spectrum of users and devices.

For example the aforementioned server may be an online system capable of communicating with one or more third party web servers not illustrated content repositories e.g. repository or equivalent facilities to provide users various avenues to locate specify search select receive and or share media content that is accessible over one or more data networks such as made accessible via third party content provider system . For example exemplary embodiments of media applications may comprise hypertext markup language HTML user interfaces or JAVA applets stored to the server and accessed via world wide web pages. These interfaces are particularly useful in extending system functionality to devices having limited resources e.g. PDAs handsets thin clients etc. . In alternative embodiments the server may be collocated with and or integrated into MSP . As such multiple users interfaces and instances of media applications can be simultaneously realized through system .

According to other embodiments media manager and media agent may be configured to communicate over one or more local area networks corresponding to user premises that are facilitated by way of corresponding home routers . In this manner routers may be used for establishing and operating or at least connecting to a network such as a home network or LAN and is used to route communications within user premises . It is noted that routers may provide for network connectivity not only for one or more computing devices but also for network connectivity for content processing device . For example content processing device may be a set top box communicatively coupled to router via coaxial cable whereas computing devices may be connected to router via wireless connection a network cable e.g. ethernet cable and or the like. It is noted however that in certain embodiments content processing device may be configured to establish connectivity with router via one or more wireless connections. Further content processing device and computing device may be uniquely identified by router via any suitable addressing scheme. For example router may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to dynamically assign private DHCP internet protocol IP addresses to content processing device and computing devices i.e. IP addresses that are accessible to devices such as devices and that are part of a LAN facilitated via router i.e. connected to router .

Accordingly it is noted that user premises may be geospatially associated with one or more regions. As such content processing devices associated with these user premises may be configured to communicate with and receive signals and or data streams from MSP or other transmission facility e.g. third party content provider system in response to processes of one or more of media manager and media agent . These signals may include media content retrieved over a data network e.g. service provider network data network and or telephony network as well as conventional video broadcast content.

MSP can include one or more media content servers not illustrated and or data repositories not shown . Alternatively user profile repository content repository or the aforementioned server may be accessed via one or more of service provider network and or data networks . Further service provider network may include a system administrator not shown for operational and management functions to deploy the virtual channel services using for instance an internet protocol television IPTV system. In this manner content processing devices may utilize any suitable technology to draw receive and or transmit media content from to MSP or any other suitable content source sink such as third party content provider system . A more detailed explanation of an exemplary content processing device is provided with respect to .

In an exemplary embodiment content processing devices may draw receive and or transmit content from or to multiple sources thereby alleviating the burden on any single source e.g. MSP to gather supply or otherwise meet the content demands of any user or premise. Thus particular embodiments enable authenticated third party television broadcast systems third party content provider systems and servers not shown to transmit media content accessible over a data network to content processing devices either apart from or in conjunction with MSP . Such media content may include media regarding traffic news sports current events breaking stories commentary headlines advertisements solicitations financial advice stocks markets events schools governments blog entries podcasts and the like. Moreover media content may be available from authenticated sources including grassroots groups or individuals non profits governmental organizations public private institutions etc.

The media content may be distinguished or otherwise categorized utilizing metadata included therewith or appended thereto. Metadata can be generally considered data about data but more specifically it can be utilized to describe all aspects of and media content distributed by system . Namely metadata can include descriptions about data aspects file name type administrator size location version or include timestamps mode bits arbitrary attribute value pairs etc. titles activities events individuals and organizations involved intended audiences e.g. ethnicities ages genders incomes educational levels disabilities mobilities as well as other like demographic statistics geospatial identifications intended zip codes school districts communities etc. locations of supplementary information and processes access methods limitations timing of activities events e.g. start end dates as well as motivations policies and rules. As such metadata may be utilized by various components of system for control or guiding purposes. According to certain embodiments content aggregation platform may be configured to aggregate and maintain one or more repositories e.g. metadata repository of this metadata for users to search and receive media content from one or more third party content provider systems or any other suitable source.

In particular embodiments system may structure and encode metadata to describe characteristics of the content bearing entities to aid in the identification discovery assessment and management of the media content by media manager and or media agent . For example the metadata can be used to optimize compression algorithms or perform other computational tasks by the components of system . The metadata might be utilized to share media content among a plurality of content processing devices . Various other embodiments might use metadata to provide search results suggest media content sources of interest to a user based on information stored in a user profile and the like. A more detailed explanation of user profiles is provided with respect to .

In various embodiments service provider network may include one or more video and or audio processing modules not shown for acquiring and transmitting content feeds including media content accessible over a data network from MSP the television broadcast systems the third party content provider systems or servers not shown over one or more of the networks and to particular content processing devices . As such service provider network may include facilities to support compression decompression coding decoding modulation demodulation optical electrical conversion and analog digital conversion as well as any other suitable signal processing and or transmission operation. Further service provider network may optionally support end to end data encryption in conjunction with media content streaming services such that only authorized users are able to experience content and interact with other legitimate users sources.

Accordingly system may include an authentication module not shown configured to perform authorization authentication services and determine whether users or content sources are indeed subscribers to or providers of the virtual channel service. An authentication schema may require a user name and password a key access number a unique machine identifier e.g. media access control MAC address etc. as well as a combination thereof. Once a subscriber has authenticated a presence on system the user may bypass additional authentication procedures for executing later applications e.g. media content streaming instances . Data packets such as cookies may be utilized for this purpose however other authentication information may be utilized such as described below. Thus once a content processing device and or source is authenticated connections between content processing devices and the content sources may be established directly or through MSP and or computing device .

In other embodiments authentication procedures on a first device e.g. content processing device may identify and authenticate a second device e.g. computing device communicatively coupled to or associated with the first device. Further the authentication module may grant users the right to receive media content from multiple system sources by revoking existing sets of digital certificates associated with a particular provider and issuing new sets of digital certificates mapped to a second provider. In this regard a content processing device may receive new media content from a second source whereas the previous session may be automatically closed when the old or prior certificates associated with the first source are revoked. This enables users to initiate secure sessions at any given content processing device or computing device linked to system whether or not the content processing device or computing device belongs to that individual user. It is additionally contemplated that multiple rights sessions may exist concurrently.

In particular embodiments MSP may comprise an IPTV system configured to support the transmission of television video programs from the broadcast systems as well as other content such as media content from the various third party sources e.g. and utilizing internet protocol IP . That is the IPTV system may deliver signals and or streams including media content accessible over a data network in the form of IP packets. Further the transmission network e.g. service provider network may optionally support end to end data encryption in conjunction with the streaming services as previously mentioned.

In this manner the use of IP permits television services to be integrated with broadband Internet services and thus share common connections to a user site. Also IP packets can be more readily manipulated and therefore provide users with greater flexibility in terms of control and offers superior methods for increasing the availability of media content including content accessible over data networks . Delivery of video content by way of example may be through a unicast or multicast from the IPTV system or third party content provider system computing device etc. to the content processing devices . Any individual content processing device may tune to a particular source e.g. virtual channel by simply joining a multicast or unicast of the media content utilizing an IP group membership protocol IGMP . For instance the IGMP v2 protocol may be employed for joining content processing devices to new multicast or unicast groups. Such a manner of content delivery avoids the need for expensive tuners to view media content such as television broadcasts however other delivery methods such as directly modulated carriers e.g. national television systems committee NTSC advanced television systems committee ATSC quadrature amplitude modulation QAM may still be utilized. It is noted that conventional delivery methods may also be implemented and combined with the advanced methods of system . Further the media content in the form of virtual channels may be provided to various IP enabled devices such as those computing telephony and mobile apparatuses previously delineated.

As such exemplary content processing devices e.g. STBs may integrate all the functions of an IPTV system as well as combine the media content functions of the various online or off line environments in a manner that seamlessly toggles among the various system resources. It is contemplated that the virtual channel service may be extended to users with a presence on the Internet. In alternative embodiments the services of system could be extended to users having an end terminal not shown such as a plain old telephone service POTS device connected to the telephony network . While system is illustrated in the exemplary components are not intended to be limiting and indeed additional or alternative components and or implementations may be utilized.

In exemplary embodiments content aggregation module may be configured to maintain one or more networked repositories e.g. repository of aggregated metadata relating to media content available via a plurality of third party content provider systems . For instance the metadata may relate to thumbnails uniform resource locators titles addressing information descriptions sources ratings tags durations media types publishing dates number of views height width size author etc. As such users via for instance media manager and or media agent may be configured to search the networked repositories for media content receive one or more search results relating to media content available from for example one or more third party content provider systems and select certain search results for streaming associated media content over at least one data network to computing device and or content processing device for presentation.

According to certain embodiments platform may not be permitted to or may simply not maintain metadata associated with the media content made available via one or more third party content provider systems . As such query request module is configured to receive query information and authentication information of a user from a media application e.g. media manager and or media agent associated with for instance content processing device such as set top box and generate a query request for media content from one or more third party content provider systems using the query information the authentication information and an identifier of a service provider of system . In this manner query request module may be configured in conjunction with communication interface to initiate transmission of the query request to the one or more third party content provider systems and thereby receive one or more search results in response to the query request. It is noted that query request module via for example communication interface may also be configured to initiate transmission of the one or more search results to the media application for presentation via content processing device and or computing device . Exemplary processes user interfaces and the features of platform are more fully described with respect to .

Additionally platform may include one or more controllers or processors for effectuating the aforementioned features and functions of platform as well as one or more memories for permanent and or temporary storage of one or more of the aforementioned variables parameters information signals messages identifiers addresses locators etc. In this manner the features and functions of platform may be executed by platform such as in response to controller s or other components of platform executing computer program code or other instructions stored to one or more memories .

Accordingly device may comprise computing hardware such as described with respect to and include additional components configured to provide specialized services related to the reception and display of media content such as one or more remote control capabilities conditional access functions tuning functions presentation functions multiple network interfaces audio video signal ports and the like. Alternatively or additionally the functions and operations of device may be governed by one or more controllers that interacts with the components of device to provide media content retrieved from for example third party media content provider system or any other suitable component or facility of system . In turn a user may be afforded greater functionality utilizing a control device to control these services functions interfaces etc. as will be more apparent below.

As such device may be configured to process a content stream including causing media application e.g. media manager and or one or more components of the media content e.g. video component and or an audio component to be presented on or at display . Presentation of the media content may include displaying recording playing rewinding forwarding toggling selecting zooming or any other processing technique that enables users to experience one or more content streams. For instance device may provide one or more signals to display e.g. a television set so that display may present e.g. display media manager overlaid on the media content e.g. video to a user wherein the media content includes content retrieved over one or more data networks such as from third party content provider system .

Device may also interact with a PVR such as digital video recorder DVR to store received signals that can then be manipulated by a user at a later point in time. In various embodiments DVR may be network based e.g. included as a part of service provider network collocated at a subscriber site e.g. user premise having connectivity to device and or integrated into device . Display may present media content provided via device to a user.

These peripherals may be configured to implement instances of media manager to access media content stored and or processed by device . For example a media content stream may be received by device and recorded by DVR wherein computing device may later access and view the stored content. Moreover the peripheral devices may be configured to program or otherwise control various functions of device . For instance a media application e.g. media agent executed via computing device may receive input from a user specifying media content that is accessible via third party content provider system . As such a communication interface not illustrated of computing device may be configured to retrieve the media content over one or more data networks transcode the media content in certain instances and thereby stream the media content to device for presentation. As such device may receive a media content stream from computing device to present to a user via display .

In another embodiment user input to device and or a peripheral device e.g. computing device executing an instance of a media manager application may cause one or more search results to be received and thereby made available to device or another content processing device computing device telephony device or mobile device capable of processing audio and or video streams associated with the search results. Still further user input to a media application such as media manager and or media agent may be configured to program or otherwise control the functions of device . For instance a user may access media agent via computing device and thereby search for locate select and or specify media content to be retrieved over one or more data networks and thereby streamed to device or any other suitable user device. In this manner third party content provider system and other components facilities of system such as MSP may when suitable transmit e.g. stream specified media content to device for presentation via display .

Furthermore device may include communication interface which may be configured to receive content streams from an MSP computing device and or other media content sources such as third party content provider system . Communication interface may optionally include single or multiple port interfaces. For example device may establish a broadband connection to multiple sources transmitting content to device via a single port whereas in alternative embodiments multiple ports may be assigned to the one or more sources. In still other embodiments communication interface may be configured to permit users via device to transmit data including media content to third party content provider systems to other users with content processing devices MSP and or any other suitable media content source sink.

In the exemplary process of however platform receives the one or more search results and as such may be configured to initiate transmission of the one or more search results to the media application that provided the query information and the authentication information to platform or a media application specified to receive the one or more search results per step . According to exemplary embodiments transmission of the one or more search results between platform and the media application may be via one or more hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS communications.

As previously mentioned user interaction with a particular search result may be configured to cause a media application to retrieve and stream media content associated with the particular search result for presentation via content processing device . is a flowchart of a process for retrieving and streaming media content for presentation via a content processing device according to an exemplary embodiment. For the purpose of illustration the process is described with respect to and . The process assumes that a user is interacting with one or more user interfaces associated with media manager which is configured to utilize media agent to retrieve transcode and stream media content to content processing device for presentation to a user via for instance display and audio system . It is noted however that all or certain functions of media manager and or media agent may be performed by the correspondingly other media application such that one or more of the media applications may be utilized to retrieve transcode stream and or present media content via content processing device . Further the steps of the process may be performed in any suitable order as well as combined or separated in any suitable manner.

At step media agent receives from content processing device an indication of media content selected for presentation. For instance media manager may provide addressing or other identifying information to media agent to enable content retrieval module to retrieve content from for instance third party content provider system . The indication may be based on user selection of a particular search result such as search result of . Accordingly in step content retrieval module retrieves the associated media content from third party content provider system over one or more data networks . It is noted that content retrieval module may be configured to transmit an HTTP GET request to one or more APIs of third party content provider system at least specifying addressing information at which the media content may be located such that the media content may be streamed to content retrieval module by one or more APIs of third party content provider system as for example a unicast transmission.

According to various exemplary embodiments media agent may be configured via transcoding module to transcode or otherwise encode the media content received from third party content provider system for presentation via content processing device per step . Thus at step media agent via for instance media server module streams the transcoded media content to content processing device for presentation via for example presentation module . It is noted that streaming cache module may be utilized to cache transcoded media content before streaming the transcoded media content to content processing device via media server module . In this manner media content retrieved from third party content provider system may be streamed to content processing device as it is being retrieved from third party content provider system and transcoded by transcoding module . Alternatively media content retrieved by media content retrieval module may be completely downloaded before transcoded and streamed to content processing device for presentation via for example display and or audio system .

The processes described herein for providing content aggregation in support of virtual channels may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for controlling cursor movement on the display .

According to an embodiment of the invention the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Model ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage media or non transitory media i.e. non volatile media and volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly the invention is not limited to such embodiments but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements.
