The invention was made with Government support under contract No. F04701 93 C 0094 by the Department of the Air Force. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to the field of continuous phase modulation communications systems. More particularly the present invention relates to symbol time tracking for continues phase modulations communications systems such as Gaussian minimum shift keying communications systems having small bandwidth time products.

In synchronous digital data communication systems the carrier phase and symbol timing of the received signal must be acquired and tracked by the receiver in order to respectively demodulate the received signal and to recover the transmitted data from the received signal. Typically receivers require carrier phase tracking for signal demodulation and symbol time tracking for data detection for generating received data streams.

Continuous phase modulation CPM provides a class of digital phase modulation signals that have a constant envelope. The spectral occupancy of a CPM signal can be controlled or tailored to the available bandwidth of a transmission channel. The constant envelope CPM signals allow saturated power amplifier operation for maximum power efficiency. The use of CPM signals in communications systems can potentially achieve significant improvement in both power and spectral efficiency over other conventional modulation techniques at the cost of a moderate increase in receiver complexity. Bit error rate reduction has been achieved using trellis CPM demodulation with ideal synchronization. There is a continuing need to develop hardware implementation of the symbol time and carrier phase synchronizers that provides required tracking functions for the coherent CPM receiver. Often symbol time tracking and carrier phase tracking limit the performance of CPM systems.

A particular type of CPM system is a Gaussian minimum shift keying GMSK system where a data sequence is precoded and the precoded data symbols are used for continuous phase modulation. The GMSK received signals are filtered using Laurent filters and samplers for providing data samples subject to trellis demodulation for generating an estimate of the data sequence. Carrier phase tracking loops are used for demodulating the received signal by tracking the carrier phase and symbol time tracking loops are used for synchronized sampling of Laurent matched filter signals for generating the data samples that used to generate estimates of the transmitted bit stream using trellis demodulation. These carrier phase and symbol time tracking loops are often referred to as synchronizer. These synchronizers often lose track during noisy communications.

The term Z t is called the complex envelope of the CPM signal fis the carrier frequency Eis the bit energy T is the bit duration and N is the transmitted data length in bits . . . 1 represents one of 2equally probable data sequences. The parameter h is the modulation index f t is the pulse response of the smoothing filter in the CPM modulator and g t is the CPM phase response defined in terms of the f t pulse response.

The pulse response f t is limited to the time interval 0 LT for some integer L and having the properties that f t f LT t and g Lf 1. The pulse amplitude modulation PAM representation of signal CPM envelope is well known. Laurent has shown that the complex envelope z t can be expressed as a double summation.

In this PAM representation of the baseband CPM signal envelope also referred to as the Laurent decomposition the avalues are known as pseudo data symbols and are related to the modulated data symbols generally by a pseudo data symbol equation.

In the pseudo data symbol equation for all k 0 k 2 0 and is a 0 or 1 digit in the binary expansion of

The set of pulse functions h t termed Laurent pulse functions have a real value and are finite in duration and are formed by an h t equation.

Among these h t pulses most of the signal energy is carried by the principal Laurent pulse h t which has a duration of L 1 bit times. Another property of the principal Laurent pulse h t is that it is symmetrical about t L 1 T 2. The principal Laurent function h t output provides a gross estimate of the transmitted symbol sequence. These properties of the principal Laurent pulse function h t have not yet been exploited in developing the error signals for the symbol time and carrier phase tracking loops. These and other disadvantages are solved or reduced using the invention.

An object of the invention is to provide data aided symbol timing tracking in continuous phase modulation communication systems.

Another object of the invention is to provide data aided symbol timing tracking in a Gaussian minimum shift keying communications systems.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide data aided carrier phase tracking in continuous phase modulation communication systems.

Still another object of the invention is to provide data aided carrier phase tracking in a Gaussian minimum shift keying communications systems.

Still another object of the invention is to provide data aided carrier phase synchronizers and symbol time synchronizers in Gaussian minimum shift keying communications systems using principal Laurent responses for generating carrier phase and symbol time errors.

The present invention is directed to data aided synchronization in digital carrier phase and symbol timing synchronizers applicable to precoded continuous phase modulation CPM signal formats such as in Gaussian minimum shift keying GMSK communications systems having for example a modulation index of with a bandwidth time product BT of . The imbedded synchronizers enable simple implementations for data demodulation for CPM signals such as GMSK signals with small BT values. Data aided tracking is applied in one form to symbol time tracking and in another form to carrier phase tracking. An advantage of the proposed data aided symbol timing synchronizer is the combination of both symbol timing tracking and data demodulation functions into an integrated process obviating the need for a separate data demodulator in the receiver. For example for GMSK signals with BT values of and larger the data demodulation performance in the symbol timing synchronizer can provide optimum performance. An advantage of the data aided carrier phase synchronizer is the combination of both carrier phase tracking and data demodulation functions into one integrated process obviating a need for separate data demodulator in the receiver. For example for GMSK signals with BT values of and larger the data demodulation performance provided by the carrier phase synchronizer can also be optimum.

In the first form the symbol time tracking synchronizer includes a data aided symbol timing error discriminator that extracts the timing error of the received CPM signal from the principal Laurent amplitude modulation component by an early and late gating operation followed by a multiplication of the data decision to remove the data modulation in the error signal. This symbol timing error signal is then tracked by a second order digital loop operating at the symbol rate. In the second form the carrier phase tracking synchronizer includes a data aided phase error discriminator that extracts the phase error of the received CPM signal from the principal Laurent amplitude modulation component by a cross correlation operation with the data decision produced by a serial data demodulator. This error signal is then tracked by a second order digital loop also operating at the symbol rate.

These digital synchronizers are use to track the symbol timing or carrier phase of a continuous phase modulation signal received in the presence of noise with the receiver operating in a data demodulation mode. These synchronizers have a nondegraded bit error rate BER performance with reduced design complexity. The GMSK signal with a BT can be used as a typical partial response CPM signal. The hardware implementation of such a GMSK receiver with both synchronizers can be modeled for providing simulated BER performance. With data precoding of the original data bit stream prior to transmission of the CPM signal the synchronizers can function as serial demodulators that achieve absolute phase data detection. The data preceding and data aided synchronization approach for detecting symbol timing and carrier phase error is central to providing accurate symbol time and carrier phase tracking in the synchronizers with reduced design complexity. These and other advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.

An embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the figures using reference designations as shown in the figures. Referring to a symbol lime synchronized data demodulator includes a symbol time synchronizer for data demodulating an r t received signal sampled by input sampler using a generated ttiming signal . The r t received signal is a combination of the transmitted signal z t and noise n t and is converted into an rsampled input signal . The synchronizer receives the sampled input signal and provides a circumflex over d estimate of the received data sequence of the rsampled input as well as generating a ttiming signal and ttiming signal . The rsampled input can be communicated to conventional Laurent matched filters such as a principal Laurent matched filter and a secondary Laurent matched filter having respective principal and secondary matched filter outputs respectively sampled by samplers and for providing respective filter samples into a Viterbi algorithm demodulator that provides a circumflex over d estimate . The matched filters and samplers and and demodulator are used to generate the circumflex over d estimate of the original data sequence using the symbol timing of the t timing signal generated by the symbol time synchronizer . The filters samplers and and demodulator providing the am data estimate represents conventional data demodulation.

Referring to and more particularly to the symbol time synchronizer of a real component and an imaginary component of the rsampled input signal are respectively isolated by an inphase component isolator and a quadrature component isolator respectively providing inphase and quadrature sample signals to an odd timing error detector and an even timing error detector that in turn provide respective odd data and even data signals to a data demultiplexer that provides the circumflex over d estimated data sequence . The odd timing error detector and even timing error detector receive the inphase and quadrature sampled signals that are respectively communicated to early late gates a and b and Laurent transformers h t a and b isolating principal Laurent components. The Laurent transformer outputs of the transformers a and b are sampled by samplers a and b providing transformed sampled outputs. The early late gate outputs of the early late gates a and b are sampled by gate samplers a and b providing gate sampled outputs respectively. The transformer sampled outputs of the transformer samplers a and b are respectively communicated to hard limiters a and b. The gate sampled outputs of the gate samplers a and b are respectively communicated to mixers a and b. The hard limiters a and b respectively provide the odd data and even data to the data multiplexer that provides the circumflex over d estimated data . The mixers a and b respectively mix odd and even data with the gate sampled outputs of gate samplers a and b to respectively provide eodd and eeven timing signals that drive a loop filter that in turn controls a voltage controlled oscillator used for generating the ttiming signal. The eodd and eeven timing signals are alternately processed and combined by the loop filter for controlling the voltage controlled oscillator . The ttiming signal is further communicated to a modulo N counter that provides the ttiming signals as well as generating the e 2k 1 N odd and e 2k N even sampling signals that respectively control the samplers a and b and a and b. As may now be apparent the synchronizer operates in a timing loop extending through samplers ab limiters ab mixers ab loop filter VCO and counter for synchronized generation of the odd and even data and the tand ttiming signals and respectively while generating the ddata estimates .

Referring to B A and B and more particularly to the carrier phase synchronizer demodulator of and specifically the carrier phase synchronizer of the carrier phase synchronizer generates a ephase adjustment signal for adjusting the phase of the r t input signal . The carrier phase synchronizer also receives an reinput sample signal from a carrier phase sampler . The r t received input signal and ephase adjustment signal are mixed by a mixer that provide an input mixed signal that is sampled by a carrier phase sampler at the rate of the ttiming signal for providing the resampled input signal to the carrier phase synchronizer . The reinput sampled signal can be fed into a conventional principal Laurent matched filter and a secondary Laurent filter providing matched filters outputs respectively to and sampled by matched filtered samplers and sampled at the rate of the tsymbol timing signals for providing matched filter inputs into a Viterbi algorithm demodulator that generates a circumflex over d estimate of the original data sequence. The carrier phase synchronizer can also be used to generate the circumflex over d data estimate is.

The carrier phase synchronizer receives the ttiming signal that may originate from the symbol time synchronizer in the preferred form or from a convention symbol timing tracking loop not shown. The resample input signal is communicated to an inphase component isolator and a quadrature component isolator . The inphase component output of isolator and the quadrature component output of isolator are respectively sampled by an inphase sampler and a quadrature sampler at the rate of the tsymbol timing signal that also drives a modulo N counter providing 2kN even and 2k 1 N odd timing sampling signals. The inphase sampler provides a sampled inphase signal to an inphase transformer as the quadrature sampler provides a sampled quadrature signal to a quadrature transformer providing respectively inphase and quadrature transformed signals to hard limiters a and b and by cross coupling to mixers b and a. The hard limiters a and b respectively provide inphase and quadrature hard limited signals to hard limiter samplers a and b that respectively sample at rates of the 2kN even and 2k 1 N odd timing sampling signals from the modulo N counter . The hard limiter samplers a and b respectively provide odd and even data signals that are fed into a data multiplexer for generating the circumflex over d data estimate . The odd data and even data are respectively mixed with the quadrature and inphase transformed signals from the transformers and respectively by the mixer a and b for generating eodd and eeven timing error signals. The etiming error signal is inverted by inverter for generating an eeven timing signal. The eeven and eodd timing error signals are alternately processed and combined by the loop filter to form the ephase adjustment signal . The eeven and eodd timing error signals drive a loop filter that in turn controls a VCO that generates the ephase adjustment signal . As may now be apparent the carrier phase synchronizer is part of a loop between the ephase adjustment signal and the reinput sampled signal with the loop extending through the isolators and samplers and transformers and hard limiters a and b samplers a and b mixers a and b loop filter and VCO for providing the ephase adjustment signal while concurrently generating the circumflex over d data estimate .

Referring to all of the Figures the Laurent pulse function is shown in for the principal hpulse function the h t secondary pulse function and the h t tertiary pulse function. The inphase component isolators and isolate the real component of the rinput signal as the quadrature component isolators and isolate the imaginary component of the rinput signal. The inphase Laurent transformers a and isolate the energy of the principal Laurent pulse component of the real component of the rinput signal as the quadrature. Laurent transformers b and isolate the energy of the principal Laurent pulse component of the imaginary component of the rinput signal. The early late gate function is shown in for providing a digital transition in synchronism with Laurent components as isolated by the isolators and . In the symbol timing synchronizer the early gates a and b operate on the respective isolated real and imaginary component energy for indicating the magnitude of the symbol timing error. The early late gates a and b ideally have a positive value and a negative value on early and late respective sides of the center of the principal Laurent pulse function. These values are combined with respective sides of the principal Laurent pulse function to provide two equal but opposite products that ideally sum to a zero magnitude error. As the principal Laurent pulse function early or late shifts relative to the current timing of the gate function the magnitude error increases positively or negatively. The area under the principal Laurent pulse function is multiplied by the gate function to produce a cross correlation of the gate function and principal Laurent pulse function for generating the magnitude error value that is used to adjust the timing signal to be in synchronism with the current symbol time of the received signal. shows symbol timing errors for the symbol timing synchronizer .

The carrier phase synchronizer uses the Laurent transformers and for isolating the energy of the principal Laurent pulse component for generating the magnitude of the carrier phase error. The carrier phase synchronizer also uses cross coupled principal Laurent pulse energy for indicating the sign of the carrier phase error. shows the carrier phase errors of the carrier phase synchronizer .

The symbol time synchronized data demodulator includes the symbol time synchronizer for generating the ttiming signal as well as the circumflex over d data estimates . The carrier phase synchronizer receives the tsymbol timing signal for sampling the real and imaginary isolated components as well as for generating the odd and even data of the circumflex over d data estimates . Hence both of the synchronizers and operate as serial data demodulators for generating the circumflex over d data estimate . Both of the symbol timing and carrier phase serial demodulators of synchronizers and operate respective modulo N counters and at the rate of N counts per symbol period of T seconds clocked at the rate of the tsymbol timing signal . The complex envelope Z t of the CPM input signal is sampled at a uniform rate of N samples per symbol period. These rsamples are simultaneously applied to the Laurent transformers a b and that function as data detection filters.

In the symbol timing synchronizer the early late gates a and b function as impulse response filters. At each symbol decision instant of t KN sample counts for odd values of K i.e. K 2k 1 the timing error between the receiver ttiming signal and the timing of the received signal is formed by respectively multiplying the output of the early late gate a the algebraic sign of the respective data detection filter that is the transformer a and hard limiters a. For even values of K i.e. K 2k the even timing error detector operates similar to the odd time error detector . The algebraic sign of the data detection filter outputs that is the output of the hard limiters a and b is a data decision on the received data symbol for precoded binary CPM received signals. The timing error formed by the detectors and is then filtered by the loop filter integrated by the VCO and quantized into sample counts by the modulo N counter to produce an adjustment to the sampling timing at symbol epoch i.e. at time instants of a multiple of N counts. The symbol timing signal as well as the sampling signals are delayed or advanced by the timing adjustment according to whether the adjustment is positive or negative. No more than N most recent signal samples need to be stored by the synchronizer to allow for the advancing of the sampling timing at the symbol time in the tracking mode.

During data demodulation the transmitted data symbol can be obtained by differentially decoding two successively received pseudo data symbols a. For a CPM modulation index of h 0.5 the data stream is precoded into a data stream dfed into the data modulator having an input symbol stream with 1 dd. The pseudo data symbol abecomes a J n dwith J n 1 for n being odd and J n j for n being even. Thus with data precoding either a conventional trellis demodulator or a serial demodulator of the synchronizers and can be used to demodulate the received CPM signal without differential decoding. A CPM modem using precoding can achieve a performance improvement from 0.5 dB to nearly 2.0 dB over a modem without precoding.

Because the Laurent pulse function h t is the dominant pulse function in a CPM signal the symbol timing error of the received signal relative to the receiver clock can be detected by using the early late gating on the received baseband signal in conjunction with serial data demodulation of the synchronizers and . The timing error is produced by respectively multiplying the data decisions generated by the serial demodulation of the transformers a and b and the hard limiters a and b with the output of the early late gate a and b. Respective multiplication by mixers a and b of the early late gate output with hard limited data decisions is needed to eliminate the data modulation so that a consistent timing error can be formed. With ideal elimination of the data modulation the detected timing error is given by a detection equation.

The early late gate function G t provides an ideal timing error detection curve D for a given CPM signal such as a BT GMSK signal.

Carrier phase error detection is formulated based on a unit amplitude CPM signal received in the absence of channel noise with a carrier phase offset . The phase offset complex signal envelope is defined by an r t equation.

When the r t signal is applied to the transformed and hard limited serial demodulator the demodulator output at time t mT is defined by an requation.

With the data dbeing equally probable the averaged value of dais zero for all integers m when k 0 and also for all integers m n when k 0. Thus with the carrier phase error being small and when the serial demodulators can correctly demodulate the m th transmitted bit d then by multiplying the serial demodulated bit by the complex conjugate of J m dand taking the imaginary part of the product obtains a random variant whose mean value is D R 0 sin R 0 . The randomness is due to the intersymbol interference which is data pattern dependent.

Because both timing and carrier phase error detection use serial demodulation to provide the required data decision for error generation the transformed and hard limited serial demodulator such as in the synchronizers and can be used for both the tracking error generation and data detection. The error signals produced at every receiver symbol time are applied to the respective loop filter and and voltage control oscillator and to adjust the sampling timing instants or the carrier phase to the received signal. Data reliability of a trellis demodulator is usually better than that of a serial demodulator such as the synchronizers and particularly when the signal memory span L is large. However if L is small or if an equalizer is used in cascade with the principal Laurent pulse filter the simple serial receiver can perform practically as well as the more complex trellis demodulator for the purpose of tracking error generation. Thus an equivalent variation of the synchronizers and is to feedback the data decisions from the trellis demodulator to the error detectors provided that the processing delay of the trellis demodulator is properly compensated for and that tracking performance is not unduly compromised by the delay.

The mean error output or discriminator characteristics of the symbol timing error and carrier phase error detectors is shown for the BT GMSK signal in and respectively. These characteristics are obtained by computing in random data the averaged detector output for a given error offset with the other offset error set at zero. For small errors the linear slope of the timing error discriminator curve is about 1.5 and that of the phase error discriminator curve is about 1.0. The deviation of these characteristics from their ideal S curves at large offset errors is attributed to the feedback of erroneous data decisions caused by the intersymbol interference in the GMSK signal.

Both the symbol time synchronizer and carrier phase synchronizer have a linear continuous time model that can be implemented digitally for use in performance simulations of the GMSK receiver. The linear model is appropriate because the tracking error is typically small when the receiver is in a tracking mode. The loop filter used in each synchronizer and is of a proportional and integral type with a transfer function in the form of F s s and the VCO transfer function in the form of K s where Kis the VCO gain. The closed loop transfer function of the synchronizers and is defined by an H s equation.

In the H s equation the term is the damping factor and is the natural frequency of the synchronizers and . These parameters are related to the loop filter and gain parameters by 2 KKand KKwhere Kis the slope of the error discriminator curves shown in . The one sided equivalent noise bandwidth of the synchronizers and is B 8 1 4 . Each of the second order synchronizers and can be digitally implemented with the integrator 1 s approximated by the digital accumulator 1 1 z where zrepresents a unit bit time delay. In a digital implementation the natural frequency and loop bandwidth parameters should be regarded as parameters normalized by the hit rate. Using the loop parameters K 1 K 1 and 1 2 for the carrier phase synchronizer and K 1.5 K 1 and 1 2 for the symbol time synchronizer the step error response of the carrier phase synchronizer to a 20 degree phase step and that of the symbol time synchronizer to a half hit time step are simulated and compared to the theoretical step error response. The ramp error responses for both synchronizers and are also simulated and compared to the theoretical ramp error responses. The dispersion of the simulated error responses from the theoretical is due to the intersymbol interference in the received signal.

The symbol time synchronizer and carrier phase synchronizer are characterized as providing error signals generated from quadrature Laurent pulse response components of a receiving signal modulated by symbols generated from a precoded data sequence. In the preferred form the principal Laurent components indicates the original digital bit sequence of the precoded bit stream. The precoding functions to precondition the transmitted symbol sequence so that the principal Laurent function indicates the original data bit stream that is alternately disposed on the I and Q channels of the transmitted CPM signal.

The precoded PCM signal allows the use of the principal Laurent pulse response for extracting the sign of the symbol timing error or carrier phase error that is also the data of the original data uncoded sequence. In the symbol time synchronizer the early late gates a and b will extract the magnitude of the symbol timing error. The early late gates a and b are sampled at the current symbol ttiming signal . As the timing of the received signal varies from the current timing of the tinting signal the early late gates a and b provide an indication of the magnitude of the current timing error. The CPM signal will carry the data information in one symbol time in the inphase component signal and in the next symbol instance in the quadrature component signal as the data bit information content alternates between the inphase and quadrature components. The timing synchronizer in combination with data preceding enable efficient synchronization timing and data extraction at the expense of requiring the use of both I Q component signals that might otherwise be used to communicate two independent data streams. The loop filter functions to smooth the timing error signal generated by the detectors and . The smoothed timing error from the loop filter then drives the VCO that in turn provides the smoothly varying ttiming clock signal. The precoded data provides the sign of the timing error and hence the symbol timing synchronizer is data aided and hence also provides an estimate of the original data sequence.

In the carrier phase synchronizer receives the ttiming signal and the received signal rand operates on the phase error generated from the r t equation that describes the phase error. The carrier phase synchronizer also uses the isolated I Q principal Laurent components and determines the sign of the phase error. But rather than determining a magnitude of the phase error using early late gates the carrier phase synchronizer drifts the phase error depending on the sine of the phase error having a sign that is also the original uncoded data sequence. The term represents the carrier phase error that is generated using cross coupling of the Laurent components generating the eand eerror signals with the sign of circumflex over indicating the direction of the phase error drift.

The symbol timing synchronizer and the carrier phase synchronizer offer an efficient mechanism for generating timing and phase error signal while also providing an indication of the uncoded data sequence however requiring data precoding having symbol modulated on both I and Q channels. Those skilled in the art can make enhancements improvements and modifications to the invention and these enhancements improvements and modifications may nonetheless fall within the spirit and scope of the following claims.
