title: Lube pump retention method
abstract: A lube pump has a housing with a flange extending radially outwardly from a body of the housing. At least one rotor is received within the housing, and a shaft for powering the rotor extends away from the flange. A retention plate is positioned on an end of the flange closing the housing. A first set of bolts secure the flange to the retention plate. A second set of bolts secure the flange to the gearbox. The two sets of bolts extend in opposed directions. A gearbox including such a lube pump is also disclosed and claimed.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 06 C 0081 awarded by the United States Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

This application relates to a retention method for securing a lube pump assembly for removal from a gear box without disassembly of the lube pump.

Lube pumps are utilized in any number of applications. Typically a lube pump moves oil from a sump to various locations. One application is a gearbox.

In particular one application is concerned with a gearbox for an auxiliary power unit or an APU. An APU is a gas turbine engine which is utilized to provide power to an aircraft.

Presently typical lube pump designs for the gearbox are assembled as a pre assembly prior to attachment to the gear box. The assembly of the lube pump is such that the lube pump can be disassembled when it is detached from the gearbox as the lube pump cover is held on with the lube pump attachment bolts.

This is undesirable due to the fact that the lube pump will come apart upon disassembly from the gearbox allowing small pump components to possibly fall into the oil reservoir or fall into the aircraft compartment.

A lube pump assembly has a housing with a flange extending radially outwardly from a body of the housing. At least one rotor is received within the housing and a shaft for powering the rotor extends away from the flange. A retention plate is positioned on an end of the flange and closing the housing. A first set of bolts secure the flange to the retention plate. A second set of bolts secure the flange to the gearbox. The two sets of bolts extend in opposed directions. A gearbox including such a lube pump is also disclosed and claimed.

These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings the following of which is a brief description.

A gearbox such as a gearbox for an APU includes a gear train shown schematically. The gear train is operable to drive a lube pump gear which in turn drives a drive shaft for a lube pump . The drive shaft drives rotor vanes to move lubricant to the gear train as shown. Carbon bearings are positioned at each side of the rotor and within a lube pump housing . Belleville washers act as a spring to bias internal components of the lube pump forcing the bearings and rotor vanes against a retention plate . The retention plate is secured to a lube pump flange through a plurality of bolts . The bolts are secured in countersunk holes in the flange and threaded holes in the retention plate . Threaded holes are formed in bosses extending away from a nominal outer face of the retention plate .

As shown in the lube pump has the retention plate sitting outwardly of the flange . The ends of the bolts are visible but the heads are not and thus the retention plate cannot be removed from the flange while installed on gearbox . Instead the bolts are accessible such that the lube pump can be removed as a sub assembly.

The removed lube pump assembly is shown in . The bolts are simply removed and the assembled lube pump assembly may be removed with the retention plate still secured to the flange maintaining lube pump assembly as an assembled part.

As shown in the flange includes three holes which are countersunk and two holes . Two of the holes and one of the holes are received in ears and extending further outwardly of a central axis than do intermediate portions between the ears and . That is the ears extend further from a central axis than do the intermediate portions . One ear receives both a bolt hole and a hole . In ear each of the holes and are received in sub ears . Again the ear extends further from the central axis than does the intermediate portions . The sub ears extend further radially outwardly from the central axis than does an intermediate portion of ear .

As shown in the retention plate is secured to the flange . The retention plate has enlarged portions which are generally triangular and receive the bolt holes . Nominal intermediate portions are positioned between the enlarged portions . The nominal intermediate portions are formed at a first radius Raway from a central axis . A radius Rcan be defined to a center of the hole . In one embodiment the radius Ris 0.875 2.22 cm while the radius Ris 1.27 3.23 cm . In embodiments of this invention a ratio of Rto Ris between 0.63 and 0.77.

As can be appreciated from all of the Figures Belleville washers bias the pump components against the retention plate . Thus maintaining the lube pump assembled limits the likelihood of the internal components separating with release of the Belleville washers .

Although an embodiment of this invention has been disclosed a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention.
