No. 5 823 879 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 010 361 filed Jan. 19 1996 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 010 703 filed Jan. 26 1996. The entire disclosure of the prior application 08 759 895 from which a copy of the oath or declaration is supplied is considered to be part of the disclosure of the accompanying application and is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention is related to a method and apparatus for automating the playing games such as blackjack so that they can be played continuously and asynchronously by a potentially large plurality of players substantially and wherein information related to goods and services for sale can be exchanged between players and sponsors of advertisements presented during the playing of a game.

The cost effective automation of playing certain games like blackjack has been difficult due to the fact that these games typically require a dealer and only a relatively small number of players may play the game with a single dealer. However with the popularity of local and wide area data communication networks it is desirable to have an automated gaming system for games such as blackjack wherein large numbers of players may cost effectively and efficiently play such games.

Furthermore it has been difficult to cost effectively provide a network gaming system on such networks as the Internet in that gaming restrictions prohibit wagering and ante fees in most contexts except such situations as local area networks within a casino. However since many players have an interest in playing casino type games it would also be desirable to have a way to benefit from interests in such games. Accordingly it would be desirable to have a system that utilized a gaming context as a vehicle for delivering product and or service information to users of a network such as the Internet. In particular it would be desirable to have a data processing system that provided a large number of players with the ability to substantially asynchronously play casino style games on the Internet for prizes at a reduced risk or at substantially no risk wherein the data processing system coordinated the presentation of products and or services from sponsors of the games so that there is a coordinated interactive exchange of information between players and sponsors regarding advertisements samples prizes and questionnaires related to sponsor products and or services.

Accordingly since the present invention as described in the sections hereinbelow addresses the above discussed problems within the context of playing blackjack an overview of this particular game is provided so that the novelty and various related aspects of the present invention may be more fully appreciated.

The card game of blackjack is a game of chance played between a designated player known as a dealer and one or more other players. Basically each player plays against the dealer in the sense that each player attempts to achieve a collection or hand of cards having a total score for the hand closer to the value 21 than the score of the hand of the dealer. However if a player s card hand goes over 21 the player may lose any wagers bet on the hand regardless of the value of the card hand of the dealer.

In further detail blackjack is typically played with one or more standard playing card decks wherein each card has a value. In particular each of the face cards has the value of 10 and non face card has a value identical to the numerical value as indicated on the card except for aces. That is for aces a value may be assigned of either 1 or 11 depending on which value a player deems most beneficial to his her hand.

In one conventional method for playing blackjack at the commencement of a blackjack hand each player initially is provided with two cards and the dealer also receives two cards. Typically one of the dealer s cards is dealt with the value of the card showing whereas the other card is dealt with the value of the card hidden. However variations on when the dealer receives his her cards may depend on the blackjack gaming rules where blackjack is being played but in any case one of the dealer s cards must be face up before the players exercise various wagering options beyond an initial ante.

After a player has reviewed his her cards the player may request one or more additional cards in an attempt to get a a value for a card hand that will be greater than the hand the dealer will have and b a value for the card hand that is less than or equal to 21. Further a player may under certain circumstances as will be described below simultaneously play more than one hand of cards against the dealer s cards. However in requesting such additional cards a player runs the risk of busting each hand played wherein the player loses his her wager s on a card hand by adding cards to the hand until a value exceeding 21 occurs. Further note that such busting of a hand occurs regardless of whether or not the dealer has a card hand value of less than or equal to 21.

Note that after each player has ceased to request further cards i.e. each player stands on his cards the dealer either takes one or more further cards i.e. hits according to predetermined blackjack rules as established for example by the gaming establishment where the blackjack game is being conducted. In general the dealer must take additional cards if his her current card count total is less than 17 and the dealer must decline further cards if the dealer s hand has a value of 17 or more. However there are various rules regarding whether a dealer may stand or hit when the card count total is a soft 17. That is one of the dealer s cards is an ace and therefore may have a value of 1 or 11 and one of the values for the dealer s hand is 17. For example the dealer may be required to take a hit on a soft 17.

Since a hit s taken by the dealer is performed after all players have exercised their wagering options the final numerical value of the dealer s hand is then compared to the final numerical value of each of the player s hand s to determine the winning and losing wagers. Note that if the dealer s hand exceeds the value of 21 then any player that has not busted wins the wagers for their hand s regardless of the hand s total value. Alternatively if the dealer s card hand is less or equal to 21 then it is compared with each of the player s card hand s and in each comparison the card hand with the closest total value to 21 without exceeding 21 wins. Of course ties are possible. In such cases called a push the player s wager s on his her card hand are returned.

It is typical in blackjack to have at least three additional player options depending on the circumstances of play. A first such option is known as doubling down wherein if the player s first two cards have a value within a predetermined range e.g. 10 or 11 then the player may double his or her wager and once dealt a single additional card the total of the three card hand becomes the value for the player s hand. Alternatively another option is that of splitting pairs wherein if the player s first two cards are identical with the exception of suit i.e. a pair then the pair may be split so that two card hands are created with one card of the pair in each hand. Thus the player must wager on each of the hands at least the initial wagering or ante amount. Subsequently a second card and any subsequent successive cards are dealt to each of the separate hands as the player requests and the results of both hands are compared to the dealer s hand assuming neither the dealer nor either of the player s two hands busts.

In a third option played immediately after each player has been dealt their first two cards and the dealer has been dealt at least a first card a player may request insurance under the circumstances where the dealer s single face up card is an ace. In this circumstance the player is betting that the dealer has blackjack i.e. a card value total of 21 . If the dealer does not have blackjack then the insurance bet is forfeited and the player plays his her blackjack hand as if the insurance bet were never made. Note that the player can typically wager an insurance bet of one half of the amount of his her initial blackjack wager or ante and if the dealer has blackjack then the dealer or the gaming establishment pays the player double or triple his her insurance bet.

Further note that options for splitting pairs and doubling down may interact with one another according to certain pre established gaming establishment rules wherein for example a player may double down on one or more of his her split hands.

Additionally there are blackjack tournaments having tournament entrants that compete against each other for tournament prizes. In such tournaments each entrant has a fixed initial number of points that can be wagered in a pre established number of tournament blackjack games to be played. Accordingly the player having the highest number of points at the end of the tournament wins the tournament. Note that in such tournaments there may be specific guidelines established at the beginning of the tournament for varying the blackjack gaming rules between tournament games. For example rules may vary on when a player may split pairs repeatedly during the same blackjack game. Also double down rules may vary so that for example after a splitting of pairs a player may be allowed to double down on any two cards or alternatively an additional wager of less than the initial wager may be acceptable when a player requests to double down.

However in all known variations of blackjack players are only allowed to enter a blackjack game at the completion of a previous game and further there is a relatively small number of players that can play blackjack at a dealer s station simultaneously. Accordingly it is desirable to provide a system for playing blackjack wherein potentially a very large number of players can play blackjack simultaneously from a single dealer station and wherein players can commence playing blackjack at their own discretion without waiting for a previous blackjack game to complete.

The present invention is a computerized interactive advertising system i.e. method and apparatus for exchanging information regarding goods and or services between a first population of users hereinafter also known as players or users and a second population of users hereinafter also known as sponsors or advertisers . In particular the sponsors or advertisers may present information related to goods and or services to the players using the present invention and the players may view this information while for example interacting with the present invention for playing a game such as blackjack craps roulette poker pai gow or the like. Moreover a player may also interact with the present invention so that the player has the capability for responding to sponsor or advertiser presented questionnaires as well as for purchasing or viewing sponsor goods and or services. Thus the present invention provides an information exchange service within a gaming context for enticing players to view and or interact with sponsor presentations such as interactive advertisements.

It is also an aspect of the present invention that each player or user is presented with advertisements for products and or services wherein it is believed the player will be receptive to the advertisement. That is the present invention selectively presents advertisements to each player according to stored characteristics and preferences of the player that the present invention has determined from for example player supplied personal information player responses to questions and or analysis of player interactions such as player requests for additional information related an advertisement. Thus such a selective presentation of advertisements allows a sponsor or advertiser to provide information related to relatively extensive or expensive promotionals e.g. demonstrations samples discounts trial subscriptions prizes bonuses to players most likely to subsequently purchase the advertised product or service. Consequently such selectivity can greatly increase the cost effectiveness of advertising wherein the term advertising or advertising presentation as used herein is understood to include not only product or service presentations that are merely informational but also more interactive advertising presentations such as promotionals wherein discounts free samples or a trial usage may be offered.

Moreover it is an aspect of the present invention that each player may interact with and play a game at a time and pace i.e. tempo substantially of the player s choosing. In particular the player is not bound by a required order or sequence of play involving other players even though the player may be in competition with other players. In fact a player may cease play for an extended time while in the midst of a game and subsequently continue the game at the point where the player ceased to play. Thus if the present invention is easily accessible then players may interact with the present invention at their leisure.

Accordingly in a related aspect of the present invention it is intended that players more generally users are able to interact with the present invention remotely as for example via the Internet and or an interactive cable television network. Thus using an Internet embodiment as an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a gaming web site may be provided wherein players may access the interactive gaming capabilities of the present invention and substantially simultaneously also be presented with sponsor or advertiser provided information related to goods and or services of the sponsor or advertiser those two terms being used substantially interchangeably to denote e.g. those who provide advertising to users and or subsidize game playing product promotionals or network access . Moreover the sponsor provided information may include for example hypertext links also denoted hyperlinks that allow players to activate for example network transfers for obtaining additional information regarding a sponsor s goods and or services regardless of the status of any game in which a player may be currently involved at the gaming web site.

It is a further aspect in one embodiment of the present invention that a player is able to commence play of a game at substantially any time the player accesses the present invention. That is it is not necessary for any previous game being played by other players to be completed for the player to commence play. In other words games provided by the present invention may be continuously and asynchronously commenced or entered by players.

It is a further aspect of the present invention to require each player to use a distinct identification provided when the player registers with the present invention before playing any games so that a network site for the invention may be able to identify each player. Accordingly it is an aspect of the present invention during registration that each player provides personal information about him herself both for gaming identification and for use as selection criteria by sponsors or advertisers for presenting particular presentations. For example in the case of an Internet embodiment of the present invention such registering can be performed via the Internet prior to play of any games at a gaming advertising web site. Thus players may be required to provide the present invention with information about themselves such as name address E mail address age sex and or other player characteristics deemed pertinent to one or more sponsors or advertisers. Accordingly the present invention provides a sponsor or advertiser with the capability to target its presentations substantially only to players or users having selected characteristics as for example determined from player information provided when registering with a network site for the present invention.

It is a further aspect of the present invention to have players compete against one another for prizes in one or more gaming tournaments. Using the Internet embodiment of the present invention as illustrative a gaming advertising web site for the present invention may partition the population of players into competitive groups wherein each group includes the players for a distinct tournament. Moreover the present invention may determine a competitive group according to criteria such as a the game s to be played in the tournament b a skill level for the players e.g. as determined by play in a previous tournament s c particular player characteristics such as age area of residence home ownership etc. d particular player lifestyle traits such as traits exhibited by exercise enthusiasts or cruise ship enthusiasts and e particular player preferences such as preferences related to jewelry personal care products or particular sports.

It is a further aspect of the present invention to allow players to play games offered by the present invention without incurring financial risk or charges beyond those that are typical for the network being used in accessing the present invention.

It is a particular aspect of the present invention to provide blackjack and other casino style games such as craps roulette poker pai gow or variations thereof wherein such games may be played by a plurality of players continuously and asynchronously and wherein each game is likely to be unique from all other games being played concurrently. Furthermore in a related aspect of the present invention such games may be automated so as to not require a manual dealer. Also the present invention may be played in one embodiment in a gaming establishment e.g. casino using low cost gaming stations at which players may play such games entirely electronically. Alternatively in another embodiment the present invention may be used to play such casino style games as blackjack on the Internet. In this later embodiment a blackjack game controller for the present invention communicates with blackjack players at Internet client nodes via a web site from which the blackjack game controller is accessed. Thus blackjack players may play blackjack in the privacy of their own homes and at their leisure since the present invention does not require that a particular tempo of a blackjack game be maintained.

Additionally the present invention utilizes novel varieties in such games as blackjack that make the games more enjoyable for users. For example using variations of blackjack as illustrative in one novel embodiment wherein the dealer functions are automated by a dealer module this module can play blackjack with a plurality of players concurrently such that each player appears to be playing exclusively with the dealer module e.g. head to head . Moreover in one blackjack embodiment each blackjack game is played asynchronously from other concurrent blackjack games with the dealer module. Furthermore the dealer module may play a different dealer card hand with each player. In particular the initial one or two cards or card representations dealt to the dealer for each game are unlikely to be the same for any two blackjack games being played with the dealer module i.e. the probability of any two concurrently played blackjack games being identical is substantially equal to chance. Accordingly this variation is particularly worthwhile when players are playing remotely through a network such as the Internet. Alternatively in a different blackjack variation the dealer module and each player concurrently playing blackjack with the dealer module may be provided with cards or card representations from the beginning of an identical sequence of card representations. Thus each concurrently playing player receives an identical initial card hand and the dealer is also dealt an identical initial card hand. Subsequently the card hands within each concurrent game will vary only if players request further cards differently. Accordingly this variation of blackjack is particularly useful in tournament blackjack played within the confines of a casino wherein the play of each player in the tournament is synchronized to start and stop within a predetermined interval. Note that this variation of blackjack is enjoyed by tournament players in that the tournament players may consider it a better or fairer way for demonstrating blackjack playing skill.

Other features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description with the accompanying figures contained hereinafter.

In a block diagram is presented of a first embodiment of an electronic system for the present invention for playing blackjack wherein data flows are represented by solid arrows and control flows are represented by dashed arrows. In particular the embodiment of presents an architecture for the present invention for use on for example a local network within a casino wherein low cost gaming stations may be utilized. Accordingly the blackjack gaming system includes a blackjack game controller electronically connected to one or more potentially remote gaming stations so that for each gaming station a player may play blackjack. In the blackjack gaming system the blackjack game controller functions substantially as a dealer would in a manually operated blackjack game and each gaming station provides a blackjack player with an electronic representation of a blackjack game wherein it may appear that the player i.e. user at the gaming station is the only player playing against the dealer i.e. head to head against the blackjack game controller . Accordingly each gaming station as will be discussed with reference to below includes a display for displaying both the dealer s cards and the player s cards. Each gaming station also includes player interaction capabilities for requesting additional cards activating various blackjack player options at appropriate times and potentially increasing various wagers at predetermined phases of a blackjack game. Further note that each gaming station when in operation may request a security code be provided by a player for identifying himself herself or alternatively the gaming station may request the player to insert an electronic card not shown into the gaming station so that information electronically encoded upon the card is read at the gaming station and transferred to the blackjack controller .

Referring now to the internal structure of the blackjack game controller a gaming station interface is provided for interfacing with each of the gaming stations . In particular the gaming station interface buffers data signals between the other components included within the blackjack game controller and the gaming stations . For example the gaming station interface may have speed matching buffers in order to adjust for differences in speed between the blackjack game controller and the gaming stations . A blackjack driver exchanges data with the gaming station interface . The blackjack driver substantially coordinates the operation of the blackjack game controller . In particular the following capabilities are substantially provided by the blackjack driver 

In performing the above tasks the blackjack driver communicates with a blackjack player registration and playing status database . The database system maintains in persistent storage information regarding each blackjack player. In particular the database system maintains 

The blackjack driver communicates with a wager accounting module wherein the wager accounting module provides the following capabilities 

The blackjack driver also communicates with a blackjack player evaluator . The blackjack player evaluator receives from each player via instantiations of blackjack gaming data objects from the blackjack driver all blackjack player requests except the data from each player indicating an amount to be wagered. Thus the blackjack player evaluator 

The blackjack player evaluator is supplied with data corresponding to blackjack card representations from a card generator module . The card generator module generates for example an ordered collection or sequence of substantially random card representations and each such card representation is provided to the blackjack player evaluator wherein the blackjack player evaluator responds to each player s valid hit request by outputting the most recent card representation received from the card generator module . That is each player at a gaming station receives a card representation according to when the player s request is received by the blackjack player evaluator .

Further note that the card generator module also supplies the same card representations as supplied to the blackjack player evaluator to a house blackjack playing module wherein this latter module plays the dealer s hand in each blackjack game. Thus the house blackjack playing module enforces the blackjack gaming rules on behalf of the gaming establishment. In particular this module determines when and how insurance bets can be made related to the dealer s cards. Note as with the blackjack player evaluator the house blackjack playing module outputs when required to provide the dealer s hand with another card representation at a gaming station the most recent card representation received from the card generator module . Further note that the house blackjack playing module provides control information to the blackjack driver particularly regarding activation of the blackjack insurance option. This information in turn is conveyed to the blackjack player evaluator so that this latter evaluator may activate the insurance option for each player at an active gaming station .

A blackjack hand evaluator is also in communication with the blackjack driver . The blackjack hand evaluator evaluates each player s hand s in comparison to the dealer s blackjack hand for determining the win loss tie for each player s hand. Thus the dealer s hand and the one or more hands played by each player at a gaming station is supplied to the blackjack hand evaluator . Subsequently this evaluator outputs win loss tie results to the gaming stations via the blackjack driver and the gaming station interface . Further the blackjack hand evaluator also outputs win loss tie results along with the identity of the player playing each hand to the wager accounting module so that wager credits and debits for each player s account may be updated according to the last or most recent blackjack game results.

In an embodiment of a gaming station is illustrated. The gaming station includes a player input area wherein a player may press touch sensitive portions of a thin film laminated with blackjack player operations and requests. Immediately above the player input area is a player output display area for displaying blackjack gaming information related to the player. Optionally each gaming station may include a player identification card reader so that a blackjack player may identify him herself at a gaming station by swiping a magnetic identification portion of a player identification card not shown through the card slot thereby allowing the card reader to transmit the player s encoded identification upon his her card to the blackjack game controller . However it should be noted that other configurations of the gaming station are also contemplated by the present invention. In particular gaming station may not have a card reader . Instead a blackjack player may be required to register either manually or automatically at a site remote from the gaming station or alternatively personal identification numbers may be provided to players for identifying themselves via the player input area wherein for example a numeric digit provided in the lower bottom portion of some of the touch sensitive areas may be used by the player to input a personal identification number. Further the arrangement of the touch sensitive portions of the player input area and the format of the display area both being discussed in detail below may have other arrangements and still be within the scope of the present invention.

Describing in detail now the touch sensitive portions of the player input area an activate enter next game button is provided. This button is used to initially activate the gaming station so that a request to play signal is transmitted to the blackjack driver . That is assuming a player activates this button at a gaming station the blackjack driver responds by requesting that the player input his her identification via for example placing an identification card in the card reader and or a personal identification number via the player input area . Additionally note that the button may be pressed at the end of a blackjack game for indicating that the player wishes to play another blackjack game. Note that in one embodiment of the present invention when consecutive games are played by a player the player need only press the button to commence a new game. That is the player s identification need not be entered for each consecutive game played assuming the button is activated within a predetermined time after the last game has terminated .

The player input area also includes a quit button that a player may press to explicitly indicate the player s desire to terminate any further gaming at the gaming station .

Additionally buttons through provide the player with the capabilities to request the following blackjack gaming requests 

Note that subsequent to requesting a bet via the BET button the buttons through are activated so that the player may input various betting amounts. In particular buttons through provide the player with the option to bet 5.00 button 25.00 button 100.00 button and 500.00 button . Moreover a sequence of the buttons through may be pressed for obtaining a bet not provided by a single button. For example to bet 130.00 the player presses consecutively each of the buttons and in any order exactly once.

The player input area also includes various confirm and cancel buttons through . The accept button allows the user to accept a last input. For example it is an aspect in the present embodiment of the invention that after each user input the input is accepted either by the player explicitly pressing the accept button or by allowing a predetermined amount of time to expire after the last player input. The CANCEL BET button allows the user to cancel an immediately preceding bet that was input. However note that if a time limit is exceeded for placing a bet due to for example the player pressing the CANCEL button then any minimum bet required will be automatically wagered on the player s behalf by the wager accounting module . Further the CANCEL LAST button may be used by the player to cancel the immediately preceding wager of one of the dollar amount buttons through . Thus if a player intended to bet 125.00 by pressing first the button followed by the button but instead pressed the button sequence and then the player may press the button for canceling the 500.00 bet associated with button and subsequently the player presses the button to obtain the desired bet of 125.00. Note further that pressing the CANCEL LAST button twice in succession also cancels the entire bet.

A SPEED OF PLAY button may be optionally provided on the player input area . This button allows the player to specify to the blackjack driver for example the predetermined amount of time after a player input to wait before each subsequent input is automatically accepted. In one embodiment of the present invention the SPEED OF PLAY button includes active areas at each end of the button wherein if the user presses the slower end of the button then the predetermined time s for automatically accepting a player input is lengthened. Alternatively if the player presses the faster end of the button then the predetermined default acceptance time s becomes shorter. However it is important to note that the tempo of the blackjack game is using the present invention no longer as important as in typical blackjack gaming situations. That is since each blackjack player using the present invention is not playing in sequence with other players there is less concern about speedily playing so as not to delay other players.

Lastly the player input area includes a HELP button for allowing the player to request assistance from for example the personnel of the gaming establishment providing the gaming station .

Referring now to display area the screen display provided here is but one of a number of contemplated screen layouts for the present invention. In particular the screen layout illustrated in display area is a representative layout for use in playing tournament blackjack. Thus when other modes of blackjack are played other than tournament blackjack then it is within the scope of the present invention to modify the fields represented in the display area according to the player needs for the type of blackjack being played. Further it is important to note that in one embodiment the display is in color so that for example diamonds and hearts are in red and spades and clubs are in black and various fields of the display area may be highlighted for focusing a player s attention on the portion of the display providing information most relevant to the player s currently permissible options.

Describing now the fields currently presented in display at the top of the display is the house hand area a for providing a representation of the cards that have been dealt to the house b for providing a status of the house hand i.e. one of STND for standing BUSTED when the value of the house hand exceeds and CONTINUING when the house may take additional hits. That is this field provides an annotation house hand followed by a representation for at least one card that has been dealt to the house i.e. an ace of hearts. In the player s hand area of the display area there are five columns providing information related to each blackjack hand the player is currently playing in the blackjack game. The columns provide the following information 

Below the player hand area is the player information area wherein additional blackjack gaming information relating to the player is displayed. In particular labeled line displays the most recent bet amount that the player has requested along with a tag indicating the status e.g. ACCEPT CANCEL of the most recent bet. Note that the status may be a ACCEPTED for explicitly or implicitly indicating the acceptance of a displayed wager via the player pressing the accept button or by default due to a time limit expiring b CANCELLED for explicitly indicating the cancellation of the last entered wager via the player pressing either of the cancel buttons or c REJECTED this status being displayed due to the wager accounting module rejecting the player s most recent bet and d ACCEPT CANCEL for indicating that the present invention is waiting a predetermined amount of time for the player to explicitly accept or cancel the most recent bet. Thus in the example of line in the player has indicated a most recent bet of 30.00 and the blackjack driver has output a status of ACCEPT CANCEL as in d above. Further note that the blackjack hand s to which this most recent bet applies may be designated in any of a number of ways such as for example highlighting the row s in the player hand area of the blackjack hand s to which the most recent bet of line applies. Alternately an indicator such as arrows may be used as in to indicate to the player that the most recent bet is to be applied to both the upper and lower blackjack hand s .

Additionally note that line displays the annotation INSURANCE BET together with any insurance amount that has been bet by the player. Accordingly the dollar amount on line and the notation at the right end of the line pertain respectively to the amount that has been bet as insurance and the status of this bet i.e. one of ACCEPTED CANCELLED REJECTED or ACCEPT CANCEL as in line .

In line of the player information area the total amount of funds available by the player for betting is displayed. For example line of indicates that the player has a total amount for betting of 1 000.00. Note that the wager accounting module maintains this total amount available for betting and updates it after each blackjack game.

The lower three lines and of the player information area provide blackjack player information that is particularly useful when playing in a blackjack tournament. Thus the information in these three lines may not be displayed when the present invention is used by players not in a tournament. In line two fields are provided for displaying playing time information. The leftmost field annotated by the label ELAPSED PLAYING TIME displays the total amount of time the player has played blackjack which in this case is 45 minutes . Alternatively the rightmost field annotated by the label REMAINING PLAYING TIME displays the time remaining in the tournament.

In line up to two additional fields are provided that are useful in tournament blackjack. The leftmost field having an annotation of GAMES PLAYED displays to the player the number of blackjack games he she has completed within a tournament. Note that in some blackjack tournaments each player is required to complete a certain predetermined number of games within a predetermined allotted time period. For example a blackjack tournament may require each player to play 50 games within a predetermined interval such as four days . Relatedly but optionally in blackjack gaming contexts where the total number of blackjack games in the tournament is meaningful the rightmost field of line having the annotation GAME NUMBER displays to the player the total number of tournament games that have been completed thus far in the tournament. Accordingly using at least the leftmost annotated field in line and REMAINING PLAYING TIME annotated field of line the player is able to determine the number of remaining games in the tournament that he she must play.

Further note that other blackjack game values are contemplated by the present invention. For example a field providing the number of games remaining that a player must play in the tournament may be added or substituted for in addition to the current values in the player information area .

In a next display lower area denoted the rules area blackjack house rules are displayed. In particular the house rules displayed in area allow variations upon the typical blackjack rules that a player is likely to assume if not presented with information to the contrary. Note that by providing these additional rules on the display of gaming stations successive blackjack games may be provided with different house blackjack rules thereby creating an increased interest in each game by the players and requiring additional blackjack playing skills from the players. Note that three house rules are provided in the present display area . That is a insurance for the present blackjack game pays 3 to 1 odds instead of the typical 2 to 1 odds b the player may double down after splitting only once and c the minimum bet is 25.00 for the current game.

Lastly the display includes a player identification area for identifying the player currently playing blackjack at the gaming station . The present player area includes a field having the current player s name e.g. I. B. Smith . However other fields identifying the player are also contemplated by the present invention including for example a player identification number such as the number that may be encoded upon a player identification card used in conjunction with the card reader for identifying the player.

Accordingly describing the web site in more detail it includes an Internet interface for receiving and supplying communications between the Internet and the remainder of the web site . The Internet interface in turn communicates with World Wide Web server a for validating and or initiating registration of web site users e.g. blackjack players at web site and b for interpreting Internet requests for routing and or activating web site modules that can fulfill such requests. Thus the World Wide Web server may access the database system for determining the registration identity of for example a blackjack player. Additionally upon receiving user registration confirmation regarding an Internet e.g. World Wide Web request the World Wide Web server activates instantiations of modules known as common gateway interface CGI scripts each CGI script instantiation or for simplicity each such instantiation also being referred to as a CGI script being a for interpreting and processing Internet requests according to the semantics of a web site application associated with the CGI script and b for constructing Internet responses from output from the associated application. Thus there are one or more common gateway interface modules provided wherein each CGI script instantiation invokes the blackjack game controller to process a single Internet blackjack request from an Internet client node where a player is playing blackjack and subsequently the CGI script constructs an appropriate Internet response from the output received from the blackjack game controller .

Since the embodiment of the blackjack game controller of is substantially identical to that of a description of its internal structure is not repeated here. However it is worthwhile to note that the embodiment of is particularly appropriate when the blackjack game controller executes on a different or remote processor from that of for instance the processor performing the CGI script s . Further note that if the blackjack game controller executes on the same processor as the other web site modules of then the communication interface may be unnecessary and additionally much of the functionality of the other components of the blackjack game controller may be incorporated into one or more CGI scripts . Thus for example the blackjack player evaluator functionality may be incorporated into one CGI script while house blackjack playing module functionality may be incorporated into another CGI script.

There are also noteworthy distinctions between the gaming stations of and the Internet client nodes of as well as distinctions in blackjack play interactions. For example the following distinctions may be provided 

In a flowchart is presented of the high level steps performed by the blackjack game controller when processing player requests in either of the embodiments of or for playing a novel blackjack variation wherein new eligible card representations are generated periodically regardless of whether they are dealt in a blackjack game or not and wherein the blackjack players may play the game asynchronously from one another. In step the blackjack game controller is initialized so that it may process blackjack player requests and output appropriate responses to each player s request. Subsequently in step the card generator module commences to output at regular intervals e.g. less than two seconds such as every 0.5 seconds random card representations to both the blackjack player evaluator and the house blackjack playing module . Thus for as long as the blackjack game controller is properly responding to blackjack player requests the card generator module continuously and regularly outputs card representations. Concomitantly with the actions in step the remaining steps of are performed. Thus in step the controller waits for a next blackjack player input such inputs being for example requests to enter a new blackjack tournament requests to commence a new blackjack game within a tournament requests to process a blackjack game play request a request for information regarding the players account and a request for help information such as how to play blackjack .

Upon receiving a blackjack player request in step the communication interface queues the request and subsequently transmits the request to the blackjack driver . In step a determination is made as to whether the player s request is related to a current blackjack game and or current blackjack tournament. If not then step is encountered wherein an additional determination is made as to whether the player s request is to enter a new blackjack tournament. If so then in step the blackjack driver determines a blackjack tournament and enters the player into the tournament. Note that in providing this function the blackjack player communicates with the wager accounting module to confirm that the player is eligible to enter a new tournament. Thus the blackjack driver supplies the wager accounting module with at least the player s identification and a specification of the tournament in which the player may be entered. Note that the tournament selection may be provided by the player in some embodiments of the present invention. Alternatively the blackjack driver may select a tournament for the player using tournament information stored in the database system . Assuming that the wager accounting module responds with a confirmation that the player may be entered into the selected tournament in step the blackjack driver creates a confirmation record identifying the blackjack tournament in which the player is entered. Subsequently in step the blackjack driver outputs information in the confirmation record to the player at his her Internet client node gaming station . Thus in the embodiment of of the present invention the output of step and all subsequent such outputs to a blackjack player are output from the blackjack driver to the communication interface for queuing until the output can be transmitted to the CGI script that initiated the player request to which this output is a response. Subsequently the output is transmitted to the World Wide Web server and to the Internet interface for transmitting on the Internet and thereby being routed to the Internet client node where the player is playing blackjack.

Following step in step the blackjack driver enters into the database system information indicating the blackjack tournament in which the player has been entered. Note that the information entered here into the database system is subsequently accessible both by the blackjack driver and the wager accounting module for determining the tournament s in which the player has been entered. Following this step since the player s request has been processed the flow of control loops back to step to wait for the next player input from a player at an Internet client node or alternatively a gaming station .

Returning now to step if the player has not requested to enter a blackjack tournament then step is encountered to process any miscellaneous blackjack player requests not related to a current blackjack game and or blackjack tournament. For example a player may request accounting information related to his her blackjack gaming account. Assuming such requests are processed and responded to in this step the flow of control again returns to step to wait for a next player input.

Returning now to step if the player request is related to a current blackjack and or blackjack tournament then step is encountered wherein the blackjack driver uses the player s identification ID provided with the request for retrieving any status information from the database system regarding any current blackjack game and or blackjack tournament in which the player may be currently involved. Subsequently in step a determination is made as to whether the player request is to commence a new blackjack game in a current tournament. If so then in step the blackjack driver requests confirmation from the wager accounting module that the player can commence with a new blackjack game in the current tournament. That is the wager accounting module determines whether the player has sufficient tournament credits to continue in the tournament. Following this in step the blackjack driver determines whether a confirmation has been received from the wager accounting module . If no such confirmation is provided then in step the blackjack driver outputs a message to the player at his her Internet client node gaming station indicating that no further blackjack games in the current tournament may be played by the player.

Alternatively if in step the blackjack driver receives confirmation from the wager accounting module then in step the blackjack driver creates a blackjack game record for fulfilling the player s request. Note that in creating the new blackjack game data record the blackjack driver communicates with the wager accounting module to both debit the player s account for any initial ante corresponding to commencing the new blackjack game and also to output to the blackjack driver data of this transaction for subsequently outputting to the player. Following this step in step the blackjack driver requests the blackjack player evaluator to provide an initial blackjack game configuration for the new blackjack game. Subsequently in step the blackjack player evaluator responds with an initial blackjack game configuration wherein this configuration includes the initial card representation for the player s hand as shown for example in area of . Note that this initial card representation is the most recent card representation provided to the blackjack player evaluator by the card generator module . Thus note that if two player requests to commence a new blackjack game were transmitted to the blackjack driver in rapid succession then step may be performed for each of the requests before the dealer module outputs a new random card representation to the blackjack player evaluator . Consequently in such a case both players will be presented with an identical initial card representation for the player s hand. Subsequently in step the blackjack driver stores information regarding the identity and initial configuration of the new blackjack game for the player in the database system . In particular a blackjack game identifier for the new game is stored and associated with the identity of the blackjack player and the tournament to which the game is associated. Following step in step the blackjack driver stores information regarding the new blackjack game for the player in the database system . In particular the following information is stored regarding the initial configuration of the new blackjack game the player s identity the identity of the tournament for which the new game corresponds and identifier identifying the new game and an initial configuration for the new blackjack game including card representations and any initial required bets. Further note that throughout the course of each blackjack game played by a player the blackjack driver and the wager accounting module update information in the database system as the game configuration changes due to interactions between the player and the blackjack game controller . Thus for a blackjack game underway each request from a player for continuing the game with a next play need not provide the entire game configuration to the blackjack game controller . Instead only sufficient information is required in the request for the blackjack driver and or the wager accounting module to retrieve information related to the blackjack game configuration corresponding to the player s request. Following step in step the blackjack driver outputs an initial blackjack game configuration for the new game to the player at his her Internet client node gaming station . Subsequently the flow of control once again returns to step to await a next player input to the controller .

Returning now to step if it is determined here that the player request is not to commence a new blackjack game in a current tournament then step is encountered wherein a determination is made as to whether the player request is related to a play in a currently active blackjack game. If not then in step the blackjack game controller processes miscellaneous requests such as for example a request for special blackjack rules relating to a current game and or tournament the number of players remaining in the current tournament the player s ranking in the current tournament and the prizes for winners of the current tournament. Subsequently assuming such miscellaneous requests are responded to in step the flow of control for the present flowchart returns to to await a next player input.

Alternatively if in step the player request is related to a play in a currently active blackjack game then in step a further determination is made as to whether the player request is for a new card representation. If so then in step a determination is made as to whether the card request is for the house or for the player. If the card request is from the house then in step the blackjack driver communicates with the house blackjack playing module for obtaining a new blackjack game configuration for the current blackjack game wherein the new game configuration includes the most recently output card representation from the card generator module as the next card representation in the house hand for the blackjack game from which the current player s request came. Subsequently in step the house blackjack playing module outputs blackjack game configuration information indicating the new house hand card representation and any player response s that the player may exercise in responding to the new blackjack game configuration.

Upon receiving the house blackjack playing module output in step the blackjack driver determines whether there is a further player response in the present game by invoking one or both of the blackjack player evaluator and the blackjack hand evaluator . If there are additional possible player responses then in step the blackjack driver outputs a blackjack game configuration to the player at his her Internet client node gaming station so that the player may exercise one of his her available game options. Subsequently having processed the player s request the flow of control again loops back to step to await a next player input. Alternatively if in step the blackjack driver determines that there are no further possible player responses then the current blackjack game is complete and the blackjack driver in step activates the blackjack hand evaluator for evaluating the blackjack game hands so that the blackjack hand evaluator can activate the wager accounting module to update the player s account according to the results of the blackjack game in the database system . Following this step in step the wager accounting module outputs to the blackjack driver updated accounting information to be provided to the player. In step the blackjack driver outputs the results of the blackjack game and the players updated account information to the player. Also note that the blackjack driver updates the database system regarding the completion of the present blackjack game as well as any further status information related to the player and the tournament to which the present blackjack game is associated. Subsequently having processed the player s request the flow of control again loops back to step to await a next player input.

Alternatively if in step it is determined that the player s request is for a new card representation for the player then in step the blackjack driver activates the blackjack player evaluator for obtaining a new blackjack game configuration for the current blackjack game wherein the new game configuration includes the most recently output card representation from the card generator module as the next card representation for the player s hand s . Subsequently in step the blackjack player evaluator determines the next blackjack play options the player may exercise for the present game and then outputs the new blackjack configuration with these options to the blackjack driver . Following this the steps and subsequent steps are performed as described above.

Returning now to step if the player request is not for a new card representation then step is encountered wherein the blackjack game controller processes other blackjack player game requests such as requests for additional bets cancellations of bets a request to stand on a particular player hand a request to split a pair of card representations or a request for insurance. Assuming that such requests as described above are processed in step the blackjack driver subsequently outputs a new blackjack game configuration to the player according to the processing performed in step . Also note that the blackjack driver updates the database system with information relating to the new blackjack game configuration so that it may be retrieved upon a subsequent player request relating to the present game. Following this step the flow of control for the present flowchart loops back to step to again wait for another player input.

Continuing now with the remaining plays of blackjack game note that in the fifth time interval the player requests a hit thereby obtaining a card representation having a value of nine and thus obtaining a player s hand value of nineteen. Subsequently the house takes hits for the next two consecutive card representations having values eight and ten respectively. Thus the house hand busted when the value of twenty three was obtained for the house hand.

Blackjack game rows for blackjack games through may be interpreted similarly to the description above for blackjack game . Note however that each of these games commence at a different time interval in that each game commences with a different card representation taken as the first hit for the player s hand. That is the first card representation dealt in each of the blackjack games through is different and further each of the card representations requested corresponding to values of the sequence is different for each blackjack game. Therefore substantially every blackjack game even if played concurrently with other blackjack games will have unique player hands and house hands. Thus not only can a large number of asynchronous blackjack games be played simultaneously head to head with the house but also there may be a greater degree of confidence by the blackjack players that the house is not manipulating card representations in that blackjack players may substantially determine the timing for substantially all hits in a blackjack game for both the player hand and the house hand and thereby reduce any suspicions that the card representations are being manipulated. Moreover in one embodiment the players may request the sequence of card representations that were generated during the course of a game.

Note that the present invention also may include other blackjack variations as well. In particular referring to step again instead of generating card representations at regular intervals this step may simply activate the card generator module so that it generates a substantially random card representation on demand whenever a request for a new card representation is made e.g. steps and .

Additionally in another blackjack variation particularly suited for tournament blackjack where each player can be monitored the players play each play of a blackjack game synchronously as blackjack is typically played with a human dealer in casinos. However in the present variation each player is provided with the identical card representations for their initial cards. Subsequently each player hand and the house i.e. dealer hand varies between players only when players play their blackjack hands differently. That is for each synchronously played blackjack game among a plurality of players the same sequence of card representations is available to each player and the house blackjack playing module so that for example the dealt card representations in each game between one of the players and the house blackjack playing module are identical for players playing the same sequence of plays throughout the game. Accordingly as one skilled in the art will appreciate for each blackjack game it may be necessary for the card generator module to maintain a predetermined sequence or ordered collection of card representations throughout the game so that players playing differently may be dealt an appropriately sequenced card representation. Moreover it may also be necessary for the house blackjack dealer playing module to provide sufficient control information to the card generator module so that the card generator module can respond with the appropriate card representation from the predetermined sequence.

Another embodiment of the present invention is presented in wherein this embodiment is enhanced for presenting sponsor or advertiser product and or service advertising to qualified players that adequately match a predetermined player profile such as a demographic profile of a particular group of players. Accordingly in there is a game advertisement controller for providing substantially the same functionality as the blackjack game controller except that games other than blackjack may also be played such as poker craps pai gow and roulette . Additionally the game advertisement controller also performs functions related to matching particular advertising with the users i.e. players playing the various games provided by the game advertisement web site wherein each user communicates with the web site on a corresponding Internet client node alternatively interactive cable television node . That is the present present the high level modules for matching players having desired user characteristics e.g. profiles with advertising from sponsors or advertisers requesting players with such user characteristics. In particular only the players with such desired profiles qualify for receiving a particular advertisement and or promotional i.e. advertising from a particular sponsor or advertiser. Accordingly it is an aspect of the present invention that various criteria may be used to make such a determination as to which players or more generally users receive which advertising. For example one or more of the following attributes may be used in matching users with advertising presentations 

To provide or match particular users with particular advertising data or user information items on each user is maintained in the form of a user profile in the user player database which is an enhanced version of the blackjack player registration and playing status database of . The user profiles are populated with such user related information as in 8.1 through 8.11 . This information is obtained when users register at the web site when users respond to explicit questions subsequently asked of them or by monitoring the network activities of users. Note that user profiles may vary in length depending on the amount of information obtained on each user. Moreover different types of information may be obtained for different types of users. For example for users having assets of more than one million dollars these users may be requested to enter their favorite vacation destination location since this may be important for certain advertisers. However for users whose assets are less than forty thousand dollars no such information may be obtained since the information would be likely irrelevant to any advertiser. Thus in one embodiment of the user profiles each user profile has a variable length section for storing user information items not uniform across all users. Moreover in such an embodiment each user information item stored in the variable length section may be considered as a pair wherein the first component of each pair indicates or references a question user attribute or user classification to which the second component provides an answer or value related to the first component. Thus for example for a particular user an information item may provide the pair 4 Madrid wherein 4 identifies the attribute favorite vacation destination location and Madrid is the value for this attribute as one skilled in the art will understand.

Alternatively data related to the advertisers or sponsors may reside in a different database the advertiser database . Accordingly this database stores demographic profiles which in one embodiment have a data structure substantially identical to the user profile data structure. Such demographic profiles may have a variable length section for specifying requested values for user information items that may be provided in potentially only a relatively small number of user profiles. In some embodiments a demographic profile includes a reference to the advertiser s or sponsor s identity a reference to the advertising to be presented and a variable length section of demographic item pairs wherein the first component of each pair has the same interpretation as the first component of a user information item pair and the second component of the pair specifies a desired value or range of values that the advertiser or sponsor prefers. Further note that in some embodiments each demographic item pair may have additional information associated with it such as a perceived importance of the demographic item pair to the advertiser or sponsor. Thus such additional information may be in the form of a normalized scalar value wherein a value of one indicates that the demographic item pair is of highest importance whereas a value of zero indicates that the demographic item is substantially irrelevant to the advertiser or sponsor. Accordingly regardless of the particular embodiment of the demographic profiles the users demographic profiles are used to match i.e. select one or more corresponding advertising presentations with a particular target group of users that presumably are likely to purchase the product and or service portrayed in such advertising presentations. Thus since such advertising presentations may be provided to only users who are likely to be subsequent customers advertisers and or sponsors may provide to these users specifically targeted advertising having relatively expensive promotionals such as product or service discounts free samples or a trial usage.

Accordingly to perform the selecting or matching of users with such demographic profiles for each user the user profiles stored in the user database are compared with the demographic profiles by the advertising selection engine . Note that there are numerous techniques for performing such a comparison for selecting a group of users. In particular a precise match may be required between each demographic item pair and a corresponding user information item pair so that the second component of the user information item pair is within a desired range as specified in the corresponding demographic item pair. Alternatively various weighting statistical techniques may be used for determining a similarity measurement when not all demographic pairs are required to precisely match a demographic profile. In one embodiment the similarity measurement may be provided by a statistical analysis module that determines the users that most closely match the corresponding demographic profile for an advertising presentation. Thus in order for a user to be selected the similarity measurement between the user s profile and a corresponding demographic profile may be required to be above a predetermined threshold. Additionally note that the advertising selection engine may perform the matching of users with advertising presentations as a background or non real time process so that for example for each user profile in the user database there is a related table identifying the advertising presentations that are candidates for presentation to the corresponding user when for instance this user communicates with the game advertisement web site .

Moreover it is important to note that at least in one embodiment of the present invention the advertising selection engine may for a particular demographic profile periodically re evaluate user profiles in the user database for reselecting the group of users to which an advertising presentation is to be presented. Thus users previously selected may be requalified or disqualified and users previously disqualified may be now qualified for selection due to for example an enhanced user profile.

Accordingly the present invention may commence or cease transmitting a category of advertising to a user whose user profile is enhanced with additional information. For example if a user indicates that he she is currently considering the purchase of a new car then adverting advertising for purchasing a car may be transmitted to the user. Alternatively once the present invention is notified that for example a car has been purchased or that no further car advertising is are desired then a further enhancement of the user s profile may be performed so that no further advertising from the category of car advertising is transmitted to the user.

Note that the present invention provides for flexibly creating deleting and modifying categories of advertisements by providing techniques for linking demographic item pairs that are similarly related to a category record or object. Thus at least the following advertising categories may be provided by the present invention sports categories e.g. baseball soccer hockey etc. food related categories e.g. restaurants grocery stores food items exercise related advertising e.g. bicycles in line skates skiing insurance related advertising e.g. auto insurance life insurance political related advertising e.g. for or against a particular political candidate and geographical related advertising e.g. for users living in a particular area such as the Denver metropolitan area . Thus the advertising selection engine supplies the selected advertising presentations to the HTML display engine for translating this data so that it may subsequently be included in an HTML output to the user by the common gateway interface .

More precisely the selected advertisement data is joined in the HTML display engine at least in one operation of the present invention with a token representing for example a gaming card for a current user game that has been issued by the token generator module this generator being an enhanced version of the card generator module of . The generated token is supplied initially to the game play engine for processing user gaming requests according to the rules of the game being played. That is the game play engine determines for each available game a how each token may be played b who receives the token for example the user or the house playing module and c the result of playing the token. Note that in one embodiment the token generator generates tokens on request by for example the house playing module and or the player options evaluators wherein the tokens generated are appropriate to the game being played. Alternatively in another embodiment the token generator may generate random tokens and the game play engine transforms the tokens into appropriate randomized values for the game offered as one skilled in the art will appreciate. Furthermore other embodiments for supplying randomized tokens to a plurality of different games are within the scope of the present invention. Additionally the game play engine contacts the player database to maintain the status of the user in relation to the particular game being played as well as the user s relationship to all of the other users if for example the user is involved in a tournament offered at the game advertisement web site . Note that as one skilled in the art will appreciate in one embodiment of the game play engine its internal modules provide a similar architecture and functionality to the correspondingly labeled modules of albeit additionally for games other than blackjack e.g. head to head poker craps roulette and pai gow .

The common gateway interface or CGI scripts transfer data between the HTML display engine and the World Wide Web server which as one skilled in the art will understand may be a plurality of high level executable programs as discussed in the description of CGI scripts of . The World Wide Web server in turn transfers the data to the Internet TCP IP stack that interfaces with the Internet for transferring the data to an intended Internet client node having an appropriate World Wide Web browser .

The present embodiment maintains information on the status of games being played and user responses to advertising in the user database . Moreover additional advertiser specific information e.g. desired demographic profiles advertisements promotionals and information related to user responses is provided in the advertiser database . Accordingly as discussed above the demographic profiles in the advertiser database may include schemas or templates having fields for designating one or more of the attributes 8.1 through 8.11 . Moreover the databases and may maintain records of various types of pertinent statistics such as a the advertising presentations presented to each user b the time date and number of presentations of a particular advertising presentation and c the detected user responses to the advertising. Thus this information may provide advertisers or sponsors with enhanced feedback as to the efficacy of their products services and presentations thereof. For example Thus by maintaining data regarding information are i each game played ii the users and iii the advertisers the host computer 308 may maintain accurate records of every type of pertinent statistics such as all advertisements seen by all users so that the time date and number of views are available to the advertiser to confirm and verify e.g. 9.1 through 9.3 following and additionally an advertiser may be able to query the user and advertiser databases and to obtain such feedback as 

Referring now to a diagram is presented providing one embodiment of the access routes or paths users navigate in accessing the features of the game advertisement web site . In particular upon initiating Internet contact with the game advertisement web site a user is first presented with the opening page identifying the web site . Subsequently the user can access the benefits and registration pages for viewing general information related to web site and also for registering at the web site as is discussed in further detail below . Alternatively the user may access one or more Lobby pages to view the gaming and information exchange capabilities as for example provided by advertisers. Assuming the user is registered at the game advertisement web site the user may proceed from the LOBBY to the game page wherein a game or game rules can be selected for playing via the introduction to game pages . Alternatively the user may instead access one or more index pages having for example listings of organizations to which the user may be allowed to access depending on the affiliations of the user e.g. a member of a particular membership discount store chain . Additionally from the index page s substantially any user may access an advertisement or promotional provided by an advertiser on an advertiser page s . However it is an aspect of the present invention that information related to certain promotionals provided by advertisers or sponsors are restricted. That is such promotionals may be only presented to users having a demographic profile that has been determined by the present invention to be sufficiently compatible with a desired user profile for the advertiser or sponsor to warrant providing such a promotional. Thus the present invention provides access to certain advertiser promotionals only to qualified users who are for example considered likely subsequent purchasers of the advertiser s products and or services. Additionally such promotionals may also be presented to users who express an interest in a particular product or service advertised. For example users who a request additional or supplemental information related to an advertised item or b provide a favorable response to such advertising by for instance indicating a preference for an advertised item or c respond to a questionnaire related to personal information or marketing survey information may also be provided with information regarding promotionals. Thus advertisers or sponsors may offer relatively substantial or expensive promotionals via the present invention to such users as well. Moreover the present invention may also utilize such demographic profiles to prohibit a user not sufficiently matching such a demographic profile from gaining access to a corresponding promotional. Accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention when the user accesses an advertiser page the user s profile in the user database is compared with the demographic profiles in the advertiser data base for determining any promotionals that can be presented to the user.

Moreover from the index page the user may be provided with the ability to link into various web sites or web site pages. That is the user may be provided with the ability to link into another web site or web page at any time a link is made available typically a hypertext link . Additionally note that similar links may be accessible by users while playing a game . However these links may generally hyperlink the user to an advertiser page within the game advertisement web site so that the user may be exposed to further information and or presented with promotional options for an advertised item. For instance certain advertising hyperlinks may be integrated into the presentation of plays of a game . Accordingly since an aspect of the present invention is to repeatedly integrate different advertising presentations and any related hyperlinks into the play of a game a user may repeatedly be enticed to seek out additional information about different products or services by activating the related hyperlinks. Moreover it is also an aspect of the present invention that when such hyperlinks provide the user with access to a different web site that at least a portion of the display of the user s Internet client node maintains a graphical format associated with the game advertisement web site and that the user may leave and return to the web site without the user being aware of accessing another web site. Moreover by monitoring user input related to an advertising presentation the present invention is able to provide feedback to an advertiser as to for example the number of times the advertising presentation is accessed by users for such additional information about products or services.

Also note that some advertisements presented via advertiser pages or as part of a game play presentation may be interactive with the user wherein the user may perform a transaction such as making a reservation e.g. an airline or hotel reservation . Further a user may be given the opportunity to provide positive and negative opinions or responses on for example various advertisements promotionals and other related matters by expressing such responses upon accessing advertisement related information. Thus it is an aspect of the present invention to be able to conduct test marketing in that satisfactory statistically representative groups of users may be selected for determining 

Accordingly input response data may be transmitted to the game advertisement web site and retained for subsequent statistical evaluation. Thus resulting aggregate statistics can be made available to for example advertisers or sponsors thereby preserving the privacy of the users. In particular statistics may be made available for 

Additionally it is an aspect of the present invention that it may also maintain statistics and or related information for 

Referring now to an alternative embodiment of the present invention presented in wherein the game advertisement web site coordinates with a third party Internet access service provider or interactive cable television provider for providing Internet cable television access to users on a reduced cost or free basis once a user has registered with the web server cable television provider . That is the game advertisement web site contacts the user s Internet service provider and arranges to subsidize the user s Internet service charges in return for the gaming advertisement web site being able to repeatedly download to the user s Interent Internet client node or alternatively interactive cable television node unrequested information such as advertising for presentation to the user.

Accordingly a prospective user of the present invention can sign up or register with the game advertisement web site for reduced Internet service fees by dialing into an Internet service provider with normal serial dialing and after gaining Internet access subsequently log on to the web site as a user identified by the generic user identifier NEW. Each user identified by NEW is forced into a connection with an enrollment or registration program so he she can provide information requested by the present invention that can subsequently be used in determining which advertising to present to this user according to for example advertiser preferences. Thus when registration is completed the present embodiment of the invention downloads for example an ad viewer program and a communications daemon e.g. ad receiver daemon to the user s Internet client node wherein this daemon allows the game advertisement web site to download to the user s Internet client node unrequested information such as advertising repeatedly. Accordingly assuming the daemon is installed the user may access not only the gaming and advertisement services of the web site but also access substantially the entire Internet through the web site at a reduced cost. Thus whenever the end user processor connects with the Internet service provider the game advertisement web site is alerted by the Internet service provider and the DISPLAY ENGINE starts up the downloaded daemon via Internet communications with the user s Internet client node . Subsequently the DISPLAY ENGINE periodically sends selected advertising to the daemon . Accordingly the daemon utilizes the ad viewer program to coordinate the display of the advertising presentation.

Note that various alternative embodiments related to the architecture and functionality of are also within the scope of the present invention. For example instead of communicating with a plurality of third party Internet service providers for determining when users registered with the present invention are accessing the Internet via subsidized Internet connections the game advertisement web site may include or be related to a dedicated Internet service provider so that when a user registers with the present invention the user is provided with a new Internet access code for the dedicated Internet service provider and the user s Internet access fees may be subsidized.

However regardless of how the present invention subsidizes Internet access the game advertisement controller is notified whenever each subsidized user connects to the Internet or disconnects from the Internet. Additionally certain reliability features are included in the daemon and ad view program for assuring that advertising is indeed presented to the user. For example there may be periodic transmissions from each subsidized user s Internet client node to the web site verifying that both the daemon and the ad view program are active. Note that whenever any advertising is received at the user s Internet client node the daemon transfers the advertising to the ad viewer program which in turn converts the transmitted information to a displayable format and forces the display of the user s Internet client node to present the advertising unobscured to the user.

Additionally note that in certain contexts the DISPLAY ENGINE may transmit a message to an Internet Service Provider indicating that no further Internet access will be subsidized due to a predetermined number of advertising presentation display failures.

The foregoing discussion of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. Further the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Consequently variation and modification commiserate with the above teachings within the skill and knowledge of the relevant art are within the scope of the present invention. The embodiment described hereinabove is further intended to explain the best mode presently known of practicing the invention and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention as such or in other embodiments and with the various modifications required by their particular application or uses of the invention.
