title: Net-timer daemon
abstract: User space applications can utilize custom network protocol timers. A registration request is received from an application to register a custom timer. Responsive to receiving the registration request, a handle is created. The handle is a pointer to be used by the application to reference the custom timer. The handle is forwarded to the application. When a custom timer is required, a request to use a custom timer is received from an application. The kernel is then requested to start the custom timer. A determination is then made as to whether a receipt confirmation is received from the kernel before expiration of the custom timer.

The disclosure relates generally to a computer implemented method a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium and a data processing system. More specifically the disclosure relates to a computer implemented method a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium and a data processing system for creating custom timers through the use of a net timer daemon.

The Internet also referred to as an internetwork is a set of computer networks possibly dissimilar joined together by means of gateways that handle data transfer and the conversion of messages from a protocol of the sending network to a protocol used by the receiving network. When capitalized the term Internet refers to the collection of networks and gateways that use the TCP IP suite of protocols. The Internet may carry information and provide services. The information and services include for example electronic mail online chat services file transfers web pages and other resources.

The availability of an accurate and fine grained timer service is crucial to the efficient implementation of many networking protocols. Timers are used to determine when timeouts occur i.e. when a timer expires indicating that a predetermined amount of time has passed and that therefore an action or computer function should be performed. For example a response timeout occurs when no response from a sought device is received over the network within a predetermined amount of time after sending a request. The occurrence of a timeout can indicate to a device that it should stop waiting for a response retransmit data sever a connection to another device on the network or perform one or more other functions.

Typically in a networking system each connection of a reliable network protocol maintains several active timers to keep track of different timeouts supported by the protocol. In such protocols multiple timers are maintained for each particular network connection to control the state of the connection based on predetermined conditions. For example in the Transmission Control Protocol TCP one timer can be a retransmission timer that keeps track of the time elapsed after a request or data is transmitted to a connected device and before an acknowledgement is received from the connected device so that the sending device can retransmit information if a timeout occurs. An idle timer can keep track of the time since any data frame or signal was last received on a particular connection such that if an idle or stale timeout occurs the connection can be shut down due to lack of activity. A keepalive timer can be started after an idle timeout occurs to keep track of the time elapsed since sending a test signal to test if the other computer system is still functioning and connected so that if a timeout occurs before any response is received the other computer system is considered non functioning or non communicative. An acknowledgement delay timer can count down a predetermined duration of time after receiving a packet of data thereby causing a delay for acknowledging the reception of the packet so that a single acknowledgement can be later sent after receiving multiple close together packets thus promoting a reduction in the amount of unnecessary acknowledgments. All these timers can be maintained for each network connection. For example networking functions like server load balancing and layer 4 protocol termination require such multiple timers to be maintained per connection of the subject device to another device over the network.

Setting resetting and expiration of these timers is typically supported and maintained by a system timer task or service. In many conventional systems a counter is maintained for each connection timer associated with each connection the counters being stored in a memory control block associated with each connection in a connection table. The timer task periodically examines the entries of the entire connection table and decrements all the counters for the active connections. For example the timer task may periodically examine the entries of the connection table every 500 milliseconds. A timeout is declared when the value of a counter becomes zero. This method requires several memory related accesses per connection such as acquiring a lock to the connection control block so that other tasks may not access the block a read of the counter value write to decrement the counter value and an unlock operation to free the control block for other tasks.

Most information technology companies are heavily dependent on the efficient exchange of information between machines in the local intranet and with the internet in general. Tuning of the networking parameters becomes a very critical part of maintaining this high efficiency. Different operating systems allow varying degrees of flexibility to cater for the differing requirements of applications.

Most operating systems including AIX allow tuning of various TCP IP related timers on a system wide and sometimes on a per connection basis. AIX is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Inc. In AIX the global values are set using the no command. If an individual application needs to set a timer value to something other than the system wide value then operating systems typically give the option of setting it programmatically using socket options . However this is only feasible if the user has access to the source code of the application and can modify it at will.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a computer implemented method avails applications use of custom network protocol timers. A registration request is received from an application to register a custom timer. Responsive to receiving the registration request a handle is created. The handle is a pointer to be used by the application to reference the custom timer. The handle is forwarded to the application.

When a custom timer is required a request to use a custom timer is received from an application. The kernel is then requested to start the custom timer. A determination is then made as to whether a receipt confirmation is received from the kernel before expiration of the custom timer.

Of course network data processing system also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks such as for example an intranet a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN . is intended as an example and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.

Turning now to a diagram of a data processing system is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this illustrative example data processing system includes communications fabric which provides communications between processor unit memory persistent storage communications unit input output I O unit and display .

As another illustrative example processor unit may be a symmetric multi processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.

Memory and persistent storage are examples of storage devices . A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information such as for example without limitation data program code in functional form and or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and or a permanent basis. Memory in these examples may be for example a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non volatile storage device. Persistent storage may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example persistent storage may contain one or more components or devices. For example persistent storage may be a hard drive a flash memory a rewritable optical disk a rewritable magnetic tape or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage also may be removable. For example a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage .

In these illustrative examples the instructions are in a functional form on persistent storage . These instructions may be loaded into memory for execution by processor unit . The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit using computer implemented instructions which may be located in a memory such as memory .

These instructions are referred to as program code compute usable program code or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit . The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or computer readable storage media such as memory or persistent storage .

Program code is located in a functional form on computer readable media that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system for execution by processor unit . Program code and computer readable media form computer program product in these examples. In one example computer readable media may be computer readable storage media or computer readable signal media . Computer readable storage media may include for example an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage for transfer onto a storage device such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . Computer readable storage media also may take the form of a persistent storage such as a hard drive a thumb drive or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . In some instances computer readable storage media may not be removable from data processing system . In these illustrative examples computer readable storage media is a non transitory computer readable storage medium.

Alternatively program code may be transferred to data processing system using computer readable signal media . Computer readable signal media may be for example a propagated data signal containing program code . For example computer readable signal media may be an electro magnetic signal an optical signal and or any other suitable type of signal. These signals may be transmitted over communication links such as wireless communication links optical fiber cable coaxial cable a wire and or any other suitable type of communications link. In other words the communications link and or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples.

In some illustrative embodiments program code may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage from another device or data processing system through computer readable signal media for use within data processing system .

The different components illustrated for data processing system are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system . Other components shown in can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. The different embodiments may be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of executing program code. As one example the data processing system may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.

As another example a storage device in data processing system is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory persistent storage and computer readable media are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.

In another example a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric and may be comprised of one or more buses such as a system bus or an input output bus. Of course the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data such as a modem or a network adapter. Further a memory may be for example memory or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .

Referring now to a diagram of a transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP and similar protocols depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. TCP IP and similar protocols are utilized by communications architecture . In this example communications architecture is a 4 layer system. This architecture includes application layer transport layer network layer and link layer . Each layer is responsible for handling various communications tasks. Link layer also is referred to as the data link layer or the network interface layer and normally includes the device driver in the operating system and the corresponding network interface card in the computer. This layer handles all the hardware details of physically interfacing with the network media being used such as optical cables or Ethernet cables.

Network layer also is referred to as the Internet layer and handles the movement of packets of data around the network. For example network layer handles the routing of various packets of data that are transferred over the network. Network layer in the TCP IP suite is comprised of several protocols including Internet protocol IP Internet control message protocol ICMP and Internet group management protocol IGMP .

Next transport layer provides an interface between network layer and application layer that facilitates the transfer of data between two host computers. Transport layer is concerned with things such as for example dividing the data passed to it from the application into appropriately sized chunks for the network layer below acknowledging received packets and setting timeouts to make certain the other end acknowledges packets that are sent. In the TCP IP protocol suite two distinctly different transport protocols are present TCP and User datagram protocol UDP . TCP provides reliability services to ensure that data is properly transmitted between two hosts including dropout detection and retransmission services.

Conversely UDP provides a much simpler service to the application layer by merely sending packets of data called datagrams from one host to the other without providing any mechanism for guaranteeing that the data is properly transferred. When using UDP the application layer must perform the reliability functionality.

Application layer handles the details of the particular application. Many common TCP IP applications are present for almost every implementation including a Telnet for remote login a file transfer protocol FTP a simple mail transfer protocol SMTP for electronic mail and a simple network management protocol SNMP .

The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account a number of considerations. For example the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that no mechanisms are currently preset that allow an application to choose a specific value for a timer without having to modify the application itself or the system wide setting. Thus an illustrative embodiment of the present invention introduces an intermediate net timer daemon to handle time out values for all applications. The net timer daemon will operate in user space on one hand to interface with the applications wishing to avail its services and with kernel space on the other hand to inter operate with the TCP IP kernel extension .

According to an illustrative embodiment herein a computer implemented method is provided for availing applications use of custom network protocol timers. A registration request is received from an application to register a custom timer. Responsive to receiving the registration request a handle is created. The handle is a pointer to be used by the application to reference the custom timer. The handle is forwarded to the application.

When a custom timer is required a request to use a custom timer is received from an application. The kernel is then requested to start the custom timer. A determination is then made as to whether a receipt confirmation is received from the kernel before expiration of the custom timer.

Referring now to an operating system executing on a data processing system such as one of server computer and server computer of or one of client computers and of . Operating system provides an interface between hardware and user which is responsible for the management and coordination of activities and the sharing of the resources of a computer that acts as a host for applications run on the data processing system.

Operating system is divided into user space and kernel space . User space is a segregation of virtual memory of operating system reserved for the execution of applications . Applications are any programs such as a web server an e mail application or a web browser that exchange information over an attached network such as network of .

Net timer daemon is a program running in user space that responds to timer registration requests by applications . When one of applications wants to register or rest a custom TCP IP timer the application sends a timer registration request to net timer daemon . Net timer daemon registers the request and returns a handle to the requesting application. Applications then uses the handle to request network related timer settings that are less than the corresponding system timer settings.

Kernel space is a segregation of virtual memory of operating system . Kernel space is reserved for running the kernel kernel extensions and some device drivers. Kernel space includes TCP IP kernel . TCP IP kernel is the part of operating system that implements the TCP IP protocol.

Referring now to an illustrative diagram of a net timer daemon is provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Net timer daemon is net timer daemon of .

Net timer daemon provides a mechanism that allows applications to choose specific values for TCP IP related timers without having to modify the applications themselves or the system wide timer settings. Net timer daemon includes register mechanism user interface and kernel interface .

Register mechanism is a software portion of net timer daemon that allows applications such as applications of to register themselves with net timer daemon in order to take advantage of the custom TCP IP timers of the net timer daemon . Register mechanism receives registration request from an application. Registration request is a request by an application executing in user space to register a custom TCP IP timer with the net timer daemon .

Register mechanism returns handle to the application in response to receiving registration request . Handle is a particular kind of smart pointer that is used by the application to reference the custom TCP IP timer managed main timer engine .

User interface is a software interface by which a user can interact with net timer daemon . In one illustrative embodiment user interface includes command line interface and programmatic interface . Command line interface is a user interface that provides a mechanism for a user to enter commands into programmatic interface . The commands can include for example but not limited to a specification of custom net timer durations. While command line interface is described other interfaces such as graphical user interfaces and text user interfaces could also be implemented.

Programmatic interface is an application programming interface implemented by net timer daemon . Programmatic interface enables interaction between applications such as applications of and main timer engine . Programmatic interface allows net timer daemon to implement an operating system independent interface having a common programmatic and command line interface. This common programmatic and command line interface renders net timer daemon easily portable across and implementable on a variety of dissimilar operating systems. Net timer daemon therefore provides an interface for registering custom TCP IP timers that is not reliant on calling socket option ioctls.

Kernel interface is an interface between net timer daemon and the kernel space such as kernel space of . Kernel interface makes kernel calls to the kernel space and specifically to the TCP IP kernel such as TCP IP kernel on behalf of applications such as applications of .

Main timer engine is a software portion of net timer daemon that resides inside kernel space . Kernel space is kernel space of . Main timer engine maintains custom TCP IP timers for each of the applications that register with net timer daemon . Net timer daemon communicates with the kernel to setup the required timers. When the kernel receives confirmation of packet receipt by a recipient main timer engine forwards receipt confirmation to net timer daemon .

Referring now to an illustrative diagram of a main timer engine is provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Main timer engine is main timer engine of .

Main timer engine maintains threads . Each of threads correspond to a single registered application such as applications of . Each of threads executes one of custom timers . Each of custom timers has a duration specified by its corresponding registered application. When a registered application sends a data packet or otherwise requires the use of a timer the registered application requests the timer through its handle such as handle of . Main timer engine then starts one of custom timers in the corresponding one of threads . At the expiration of the custom timer main timer engine notifies the kernel interface such as kernel interface of of the expiration of the one of custom timers . The kernel interface then makes a kernel call to the TCP IP kernel such as TCP IP kernel of . The TCP IP kernel can then make any necessary kernel functions in response to the expiration such as but not limited to resending of the data packet.

Referring now to an illustrative diagram of a main timer engine is provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Main timer engine is main timer engine of . Main timer engine is an alternative embodiment of main timer engine of .

Main timer engine includes plurality of timer blocks . Each of plurality of timer blocks is for a different predetermined duration. When a registered application sends a data packet or otherwise requires the use of a timer the registered application requests the timer through its handle such as handle of . Main timer engine then assembles ones of the plurality of timer blocks to execute sequentially such that the total duration of the assembled ones of the plurality of timer blocks is equal to the custom TCP IP timer for the requesting application. At the expiration of the custom timer main timer engine notifies the kernel interface such as kernel interface of of the expiration of the one of custom timers as in . The kernel interface then makes a kernel call to the TCP IP kernel such as TCP IP kernel of The TCP IP kernel can then make any necessary kernel functions in response to the expiration such as but not limited to resending of the data packet.

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating registering applications with a net timer daemon is shown according to an illustrative embodiment. Process is a software process executing on a software component such as net timer daemon of .

Process begins when a registration request is received from an application executing in user space to register a custom TCP IP timer with the net timer daemon Step . The registration request can be registration request of .

Responsive to receiving the registration request process creates and returns a handle to the requesting application step with the process terminating thereafter. The handle is a particular kind of smart pointer that is used by the requesting application to reference the custom TCP IP timer managed by the net timer daemon. The handle can be handle of . Once registered the registered applications can then use the handle to request network related timer settings that are less than the corresponding system timer settings.

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating a process for setting and executing a custom timer is shown according to an illustrative embodiment. Process is a software process executing on a software component such as net timer daemon of .

Process begins when a registered application requests the use of a custom timer step . Registered applications can request the use of the custom timer by referencing the timer through the handle created for the application such as handle of . A registered application may request or require the use of a custom timer when for example the application sends a data packet.

Process then requests the kernel to start the custom timer step . The kernel then polls for a receipt confirmation step . Process identifies whether the receipt confirmation is received before expiration of the custom timer step .

Responsive to receiving the receipt confirmation prior to expiration of the custom timer yes at step the process then restarts the custom timer step . Process then iterates back to step for restarting the custom timer.

Returning now to step responsive to not receiving the receipt confirmation prior to expiration of the custom timer no at step process notifies the kernel that the receipt confirmation was not received within the timeout period step . Process can notify the kernel through a kernel interface such as kernel interface of of the expiration of the one of custom timers of . The kernel interface then makes a kernel call to the TCP IP kernel such as TCP IP kernel of . The TCP IP kernel can then make any necessary kernel functions in response to the expiration such as but not limited to resending of the data packet. Process then iterates back to step for restarting the custom timer.

Thus the illustrative embodiment herein provide a computer implemented method for availing applications use of custom network protocol timers. A registration request is received from an application to register a custom timer. Responsive to receiving the registration request a handle is created. The handle is a pointer to be used by the application to reference the custom timer. The handle is forwarded to the application.

When a custom timer is required a request to use a custom timer is received from an application. The kernel is then requested to start the custom timer. A determination is then made as to whether a receipt confirmation is received from the kernel before expiration of the custom timer.
