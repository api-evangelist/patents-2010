The one to one conversation mode employs SMS transmission unless media is attached to the message in which case an MMS message is used.

In broadcast conversation mode a message and or voice call is transmitted to more than one recipient. Each recipient views only the sender s messages and or voice calls. In the absence of media messages are transmitted over SMS.

In group conversation mode a message is transmitted between two or more recipients and a sender with all recipients seeing all messages to and from other recipients. Regardless of whether media is attached all messages are transmitted over MMS with addresses populating the cc field. In a group conversation the conversation can illustrate messages and or calls threaded for a group of recipients. The recipients can be noted on the communication device screen and any message or call sent or received from or to anyone in the group is shown in the conversation.

Each message can represent a call an SMS message or an MMS message. In the case of a call the Message has can have no message components because the message can be represented in a message object. In the case of an SMS there can be a single message component holding the text of the message. In the case of an MMS there can be any number of message components each representing either text or a supported media type including but not limited to a picture audio file or the like. The recipient can be the user sending or receiving a call SMS or MMS. The recipient s information can be linked with the recipient s contact data if an entry for the recipient exists in the contacts information on the communication device or is accessible by the communication device.

The messaging screen can provide a display area . The display area can display messaging content to or from an individual or group indicia identifying the individual or group a button for displaying one or more conversations a button for indicating whether a contacts or social media screen or conversation screen when the UI is a triptych UI as described in U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 12 645 726 filed Dec. 21 2009 titled SYSTEMS APPARATUS METHODS AND COMPUTER READABLE STORAGE MEDIA FOR FACILITATING INTEGRATED MESSAGING CONTACTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A SELECTED ENTITY which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The messaging content can compose the conversation history displayed in the display area . The conversation history can be a chronological history of sent and received messaging content. The sent and received messaging content can include sent and or received telephone or video calls and text or other non telephone call messages. The most recent event or messaging content can appear at the bottom of the list. If more than a predetermined number of events or messaging content is displayed only the most recent number is displayed. In some embodiments the predetermined number of events or messaging content is 25 events or messaging content displays.

In some embodiments if the conversation includes more than one unread event e.g. unread messaging content the list can be position at the top of the oldest unread object. However in some embodiments wherein the UI is a triptych UI if the triptych UI is navigated from the messaging screen to the social media or contacts screen and then back to the messaging screen the position of the conversation list is displayed to be the same position of the conversation list prior to navigating to the social media or contacts screen. In other embodiments the list position is preserved after a call detail or message detail overlay is displayed on the UI. The call detail or message detail can be information about a telephone call or other messaging content in the conversation list. The call detail and message detail can include such as the author of the messaging content the duration of a call the time of a call or other messaging content received by the recipient and or any error notifications re the call or other messaging content. In some embodiments the communication device can display the call detail or other messaging content detail when the communication device detects that the call or other messaging content has been selected e.g. depressed activated for a predetermined amount of time.

In some embodiments the list position is not preserved for messaging content taller than the height of the area in which the conversation history is displayed. In these cases the position of the list defaults to the top of the messaging content.

In some embodiments the indicia identifying the individual or group can be a contact name stored in the contacts of the communication device .

In various embodiments the messaging content can be provided in bubbles or other visual indicia of the individual or groups that transmitted the messaging content . The messaging content can be organized in chronological order by the time at which the content was received at the communication device . When messaging content is sent from the communication device such as messaging content the messaging content can be ordered according to the time that it was sent from the communication device. Thus the ordering and display of messaging content can be user centric by being based on the perspective of the user viewing the messaging content.

Similarly as shown in the display of the messaging content at the communication device that sent the messaging content is ordered according to the perspective of the communication device that sent the messaging content . As such the messaging content appears earlier than the messaging content because the messaging content is ordered according to the perspective of the communication device . The ordering can be as shown in .

As shown in because the messaging content was sent from the communication device prior to sending messaging content the messaging content is displayed above the displayed content . Similarly the messaging content was received by the communication device after receiving the messaging content so the messaging content is displayed after the messaging content . In general the system can be configured to display for each communication device a user centric ordering of heterogeneous or homogeneous messaging content such that messaging content sent from a communication device is displayed on a communication device in an order according the time that the messaging content was sent from the communication device and such that messaging content received at the communication device is displayed on the communication device in an order according to the time that the messaging content was received at the communication device.

As such referring back to because messaging content was not received by the communication device until after the messaging content had been received by the communication device the messaging content on communication device is shown below the messaging content . Similarly referring to because messaging content was sent from communication device before messaging content was sent from communication device the messaging content on communication device is shown above the messaging content .

Referring back to in some embodiments the display area can also include time information in the form of a timestamp or any other manner for indicating a time that messaging content was received. The time information can be displayed when a predetermined amount of time has passed since the last event or messaging content. When such occurs the next event or messaging content can be displayed in association with time information for the call or other messaging content.

Time information can also be displayed and or associated with a message based on a 12 hour clock in the format HH MM am or pm e.g. 1 00 pm or based on a 24 hour clock in the format HH MM e.g. 13 00 .

In various embodiments the time information can be displayed and or associated with a message in a short format or a long format and for each format based on the time or date associated with the messaging content. For example for short format or long format time information for messaging content associated with the current day can include 12 hour or 24 hour format time information.

In long format time information for messaging content associated with a day prior to the current day can include the 12 hour or 24 hour format time and other indicia such as but not limited to the day month and or year of the messaging content.

By way of example but not limitation for long format time information can be as follows. Time information for messaging content associated with the previous day can be any indicia indicating that the messaging content is associated with a previous day along with the 12 hour or 24 hour format of the time associated with the messaging content e.g. Yesterday 2 42 pm . Time information for messaging content more than one day prior to the current day and less than one week prior to the current day can be indicated as the day of the week along with the 12 hour or 24 hour format of the time associated with the messaging content e.g. Sunday 2 42 pm . Time information for messaging content more than one week prior to the current day and in the same year as the current day can be indicated as the day month and date associated with the messaging content along with the 12 hour or 24 hour format of the time associated with the messaging content e.g. Fri Jun. 11 2 42 pm . In some embodiments the date can be indicated using alpha characters along with the 12 hour or 24 hour format of the time associated with the messaging content e.g. Fri June Eleventh 2 42 pm . Time information for messaging content more than one week prior to the current day and in another year as the current day can be indicated as the month date and year associated with the messaging content along with the 12 hour or 24 hour format of the time associated with the messaging content e.g. Jun. 11 08 2 42 pm . In some embodiments one or more of the month and or year can be truncated. In some embodiments one or more of the day and month can be truncated. In some embodiments the date and or year can be indicated using alpha characters. For example the date can be indicated as Eleventh instead of 11 .

By contrast in short format time information for messaging content associated with a day prior to the current day can include indicia such as but not limited to the day month and or year of the messaging content in lieu of also including the 12 hour or 24 hour format.

By way of example but not limitation for short format time information can be as follows. Time information for messaging content associated with the previous day can be any other indicia indicating that the messaging content is associated with a previous day e.g. Yesterday . Time information for messaging content more than one day prior to the current day and less than one week prior to the current day can be indicated as the day of the week e.g. Sunday . Time information for messaging content more than one week prior to the current day and in the same year as the current day can be indicated as the day month and date associated with the messaging content e.g. Fri Jun. 11 . In some embodiments one or more of the day and month can be truncated. In some embodiments the date can be indicated using alpha characters e.g. Fri Jun. Eleventh . Time information for messaging content more than one week prior to the current day and in another year as the current day can be indicated as the month date and year associated with the messaging content e.g. Jun. 11 2008 . In some embodiments one or more of the month and or year can be truncated. In some embodiments one or more of the day and month can be truncated. In some embodiments the date and or year can be indicated using alpha characters. For example the date can be indicated as Eleventh instead of 11 .

In some embodiments time information is displayed associated with the messaging content when a predetermined amount of time since the receipt or sending of an event or messaging content has elapsed. In some embodiments the predetermined amount of time is 20 minutes.

The messaging content can include but is not limited to textual graphical video and or pictorial information. The messaging content can be indicative of a telephone call such as that shown at a text message such as that shown at an email message a picture message or otherwise. Additionally the messaging content can include audio files and or links to websites or audio files. As shown in the type of messaging content is heterogeneously composed of different types of messages displayed in the display area . As such different types of messages including but not limited to indicia indicating incoming ongoing or missed telephone calls can be displayed with text messages email messages picture messages website links and the like.

As shown in while the sender can make a telephone call to the communication device at a selected time as described at message the messaging content is ordered in the display region based on the time that the communication device receives the messaging content as compared to the ordering and displaying the messaging content based on the time that the sender sends the message. As such the system can account for network delay between the sender and the recipient and display a received telephone call shown as messaging content for example based on the time that the call is received by the communication device .

As such the system can provide continuity of display of messaging content based on the perspective of the recipient as opposed to the sender to facilitate threading telephone calls into the conversation thread. Due to the real time nature of telephone calls because the system threads telephone call messaging content with other messaging content and telephone calls are presumed to be provided in real time and is typically handled as real time data ordering messaging content with a recipient based approach is uniquely tied to the type of data i.e. calls being included in the thread.

With systems that thread only non real time data e.g. text messages email messages ordering messages based on the time that the sender sent the message instead of ordering based on the time that the recipient received the message can be provided and easily used by the user. It would not be obvious to adapt sender based systems to recipient based systems because the nature of the data previously transmitted non real time data would reduce the need for a recipient receipt based approach because the received time is not critical.

The display region can also include a text box for entering text to send to another user and a button or region of the display region that can be depressed or otherwise activated to send the message after the message has been typed into text box .

In some embodiments the display region can display sent and received messages between the user of the communication device and a contact or entity representing a plurality of people such as an organization or the like . In some embodiments the sent messaging content can be displayed on one side of the display area and the received messaging content can be displayed on the other side of the display area . In one embodiment received messaging content is displayed on the left side of the display area and sent messaging content is displayed on the right side of the display area .

While the embodiments described herein are described with reference to a combination of two or more components in various embodiments one or more of the functions or structure or part thereof associated with the two or more components of the communication devices can be performed or provided in the heterogeneous messaging component respectively. Additionally steps associated with various methods described herein that can be described with reference to different components or applications can be performed by a single component or application. Finally multiple steps can be combined and performed in a single step single steps can be performed as multiple steps and steps described as being performed in sequence or parallel can be performed partly or completely in parallel or sequence respectively.

While threading has been described with regard to threading being displayed while the communication device is displaying conversations and or messaging generally in various embodiments threading can be performed and displayed while the communication device and or UI is locked. Communication devices and or UIs can be locked based on any number of different protocols including but not limited to the security protocols described in U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 12 902 979 filed Oct. 12 2010 titled LOCKING AND UNLOCKING OF AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE USING A SLOPED LOCK TRACK U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 12 643 726 filed Dec. 21 2009 titled SYSTEMS APPARATUS METHODS AND COMPUTER READABLE STORAGE MEDIA FOR FACILITATING INTEGRATED MESSAGING CONTACTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A SELECTED ENTITY the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In various embodiments while the communication device and or UI is locked threading of messaging content e.g. voice voicemail system messages text e.g. MMS messages SMS messages email messages instant messages pictorial video audio data traffic e.g. user opted notifications including but not limited to traffic reports news alerts weather information stock reports social networking chats social networking posts and or social networking status updates can be performed. One or more portions of the threaded content can be displayed.

For example as shown in a display region of a UI can be displayed outputting information indicative of threaded content. In some embodiments while the communication device is locked the display region can be provided as a pop up screen overlaying one or more portions of a screen of the communication device that is displayed prior to the display of the pop up screen.

As shown in messaging content can be threaded with messaging content which can be the next messaging content in the thread in some embodiments. As such the threading can be displayed in a horizontal fashion as shown. The most recent messaging content can be displayed in display region while the next messaging content in the thread can be partially displayed in the display region in some embodiments. In some embodiments swiping left and right can display the threaded messaging content in chronological order of receipt at the communication device.

By way of mere example but not limitation messaging content can include messaging details indicative of the sender of the message and the time that the message was received at the recipient. The messaging content can also include a message or portion thereof and or media associated with the messaging content . The icon can change in appearance based on the type of media attached to the messaging content .

The display region can also display buttons or icons that can be activated by a user of the communication device to close the notification of the messaging content and or to close the pop up screen or to view the entirety of the messaging content. While the messaging content is displayed with only a portion of the message showing in some embodiments as shown in the sender s name and or any other information included in the messaging content can be abbreviated. Thus the button or icon can be activated to display the entirety of such abbreviated information.

As also shown in the display region can display icons indicative of the type of information displayed in the notification. For example in the embodiment shown a threaded messaging icon can appear in an enlarged fashion relative to the other icons to indicate that the notification displays information about threaded messaging.

In various embodiments the UI component can control the display region and or the pop up screen displaying the display region to disappear after a pre defined amount of time of no receipt of inputs from the user to the display region . By way of example but not limitation the pre defined amount of time can be 10 seconds.

While displays a portion of a message that is included in the threaded messaging content at the communication device as shown at C D and E any number of other types of threaded messaging content can also be displayed while the communication device and or UI is locked. By way of example but not limitation the threaded content displayed can be indicative of a new voicemail as shown in numerous voicemails threaded within a thread as shown in a missed call as shown in and or a group text message including media as shown in .

Generally program modules include routines programs components data structures etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the inventive methods can be practiced with other computer system configurations including single processor or multiprocessor computer systems minicomputers mainframe computers as well as personal computers hand held computing devices microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics and the like each of which can be operatively coupled to one or more associated devices.

The illustrated aspects of the disclosed subject matter can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where certain tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment program modules can be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

Computing devices can include a variety of media which can include computer readable storage media and or communications media which two terms are used herein differently from one another as follows. Computer readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a computing device and includes both volatile and non volatile media removable and non removable media. By way of example and not limitation computer readable storage media can be implemented in connection with any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions program modules structured data or unstructured data. Computer readable storage media can include but are not limited to read only memory ROM random access memory RAM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM flash memory or other memory technology compact disc read only memory CD ROM digital versatile disk DVD or other optical disk storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or other tangible and or non transitory media which can be used to store desired information. Computer readable storage media can be accessed by one or more local or remote computing devices e.g. via access requests queries or other data retrieval protocols for a variety of operations with respect to the information stored by the medium.

Communication media can embody computer readable instructions data structures program modules and or other structured or unstructured data in a data signal such as a modulated data signal e.g. a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery or transport media. The term modulated data signal or modulated data signals refers to a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in one or more signals. By way of example and not limitation communication media include wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection and wireless media such as acoustic radio frequency RF infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above can also be included within the scope of communication media. In some embodiments communication media are capable of subsequently propagating through electrically conductive media e.g. such as a system bus microprocessor data port and the like and or non electrically conductive media e.g. in the form of radio frequency microwave frequency optical frequency and similar electromagnetic frequency modulated data signals .

In accordance with various aspects the computing environment for implementing various aspects includes a computer the computer including a processing unit a system memory and a system bus . The system bus couples system components including but not limited to the system memory to the processing unit . The processing unit can be any of various commercially available processors such a single core processor a multi core processor or any other suitable arrangement of processors. The system bus can be any of several types of bus structure that can further interconnect to a memory bus with or without a memory controller a peripheral bus and a local bus using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures. The system memory can include ROM random access memory RAM high speed RAM such as static RAM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM EEPROM flash memory and or the like. Additionally or alternatively the computer can include a hard disk drive upon which program instructions data and the like can be retained. Moreover removable data storage can be associated with the computer . Hard disk drives removable media computer readable storage media etc. can be communicatively coupled to the processing unit by way of the system bus .

The system memory can retain a number of program modules such as an operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data. All or portions of an operating system applications modules and or data can be for instance cached in RAM retained upon a hard disk drive or any other suitable location. A user can enter commands and information into the computer through one or more wired wireless input devices such as a keyboard pointing and clicking mechanism pressure sensitive screen microphone joystick stylus pen etc. A monitor or other type of interface can also be connected to the system bus .

The computer can operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and or wireless communications to one or more remote computers phones or other computing devices such as workstations server computers routers personal computers portable computers microprocessor based entertainment appliances peer devices or other common network nodes etc. The computer can connect to other devices networks by way of antenna port network interface adaptor wireless access point modem and or the like.

The computer is operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operatively disposed in wireless communication e.g. a printer scanner desktop and or portable computer portable data assistant communications satellite any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag e.g. a kiosk news stand restroom and telephone. This includes at least WiFi and BLUETOOTH wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

WiFi allows connection to the Internet from a desired location e.g. couch at home a bed in a hotel room or a conference room at work etc. without wires. WiFi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. mobile phones computers etc. to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a base station. WiFi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 a b g etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A WiFi network can be used to connect communication devices e.g. mobile phones computers etc. to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet . WiFi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands at an 11 Mbps 802.11a or 54 Mbps 802.11b data rate for example or with products that contain both bands dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.

The embedded client communicates with an application APP that provides services and or information to an end user. One example of the application can be navigation software that provides near real time traffic information that is received via the embedded client to the end user. The navigation software can provide road conditions suggest alternate routes etc. based at least in part on the location of the MS . Those of ordinary skill in the art understand that there are many different methods and systems of locating an MS .

Alternatively the MS and a device can be enabled to communicate via a short range wireless communication link such as BLUETOOTH technologies. For example a BLUETOOTH SIM Access Profile can be provided in an automobile e.g. device that communicates with the SIM in the MS to enable the automobile s communications system to pull information from the MS . The BLUETOOTH communication system in the vehicle becomes an embedded phone that employs an antenna associated with the automobile. The result is improved reception of calls made in the vehicle. As one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize an automobile is one example of the device . There can be an endless number of devices that use the SIM within the MS to provide services information data audio video etc. to end users.

The BTS is physical equipment such as a radio tower that enables a radio interface to communicate with the MS. Each BTS can serve more than one MS. The BSC manages radio resources including the BTS. The BSC can be connected to several BTSs. The BSC and BTS components in combination are generally referred to as a base station BSS or radio access network RAN .

The GSM core network also includes a Mobile Switching Center MSC a Gateway Mobile Switching Center GMSC a Home Location Register HLR Visitor Location Register VLR an Authentication Center AuC and an Equipment Identity Register EIR . The MSC performs a switching function for the network. The MSC also performs other functions such as registration authentication location updating handovers and call routing. The GMSC provides a gateway between the GSM network and other networks such as an Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN or Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTNs . In other words the GMSC provides interworking functionality with external networks.

The HLR is a data store component or component s that comprises administrative information regarding each subscriber registered in a corresponding GSM network. The HLR also includes the current location of each MS. The VLR is a data store component or component s that contains selected administrative information from the HLR . The VLR contains information necessary for call control and provision of subscribed services for each MS currently located in a geographical area controlled by the VLR. The HLR and the VLR together with the MSC provide the call routing and roaming capabilities of GSM. The AuC provides the parameters needed for authentication and encryption functions. Such parameters allow verification of a subscriber s identity. The EIR stores security sensitive information about the mobile equipment.

A Short Message Service Center SMSC allows one to one Short Message Service SMS messages to be sent to from the MS . A Push Proxy Gateway PPG is used to push e.g. send without a synchronous request content to the MS . The PPG acts as a proxy between wired and wireless networks to facilitate pushing of data to the MS . A Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP protocol router is provided to convert SMS based SMPP messages to cell broadcast messages. SMPP is a protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as short message service centers. It is often used to allow third parties e.g. content suppliers such as news organizations to submit bulk messages.

To gain access to GSM services such as speech data and short message service SMS the MS first registers with the network to indicate its current location by performing a location update and IMSI attach procedure. The MS sends a location update including its current location information to the MSC VLR via the BTS and the BSC . The location information is then sent to the MS s HLR. The HLR is updated with the location information received from the MSC VLR. The location update also is performed when the MS moves to a new location area. Typically the location update is periodically performed to update the data store component as location updating events occur.

The GPRS network is logically implemented on the GSM core network architecture by introducing two packet switching network nodes a serving GPRS support node SGSN a cell broadcast and a Gateway GPRS support node GGSN . The SGSN is at the same hierarchical level as the MSC in the GSM network. The SGSN controls the connection between the GPRS network and the MS . The SGSN also keeps track of individual MS s locations and security functions and access controls.

A Cell Broadcast Center CBC communicates cell broadcast messages that are typically delivered to multiple users in a specified area. Cell Broadcast is one to many geographically focused service. It enables messages to be communicated to multiple mobile phone customers who are located within a given part of its network coverage area at the time the message is broadcast.

The GGSN provides a gateway between the GPRS network and a public packet network PDN or other IP networks . In embodiments the GGSN provides interworking functionality with external networks and sets up a logical link to the MS through the SGSN. When packet switched data leaves the GPRS network it is transferred to an external Transmission Control Protocol TCP IP network such as an X.25 network or the Internet. In order to access GPRS services the MS first attaches itself to the GPRS network by performing an attach procedure. The MS then activates a packet data protocol PDP context thus activating a packet communication session between the MS the SGSN and the GGSN.

In a GSM GPRS network GPRS services and GSM services can be used in parallel. The MS can operate in one three classes class A class B and class C. A class A MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services simultaneously. A class A MS also supports simultaneous operation of GPRS services and GSM services. For example class A mobiles can receive GSM voice data SMS calls and GPRS data calls at the same time. A class B MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services simultaneously. However a class B MS does not support simultaneous operation of the GPRS services and GSM services. That is a class B MS can only use one of the two services at a given time. A class C MS can attach for only one of the GPRS services and GSM services at a time. Simultaneous attachment and operation of GPRS services and GSM services is not possible with a class C MS.

A GPRS network can be designed to operate in three network operation modes NOM NOM and NOM . A network operation mode of a GPRS network is indicated by a parameter in system information messages transmitted within a cell. The system information messages dictates a MS where to listen for paging messages and how signal towards the network. The network operation mode represents the capabilities of the GPRS network. In a NOM network a MS can receive pages from a circuit switched domain e.g. call when engaged in a data call. The MS can suspend the data call or take both simultaneously depending on the ability of the MS. In a NOM network a MS cannot receive pages from a circuit switched domain when engaged in a data call since the MS is receiving data and is not listening to a paging channel. In a NOM network a MS can monitor pages for a circuit switched network while received data and vice versa.

The IP multimedia network was introduced with 3GPP Release 5 and includes an IP multimedia subsystem IMS to provide rich multimedia services to end users. A representative set of the network entities within the IMS are a call session control function CSCF a media gateway control function MGCF a media gateway MGW and a master subscriber data store component called a home subscriber server HSS . The HSS can be common to the GSM network the GPRS network as well as the IP multimedia network .

The IP multimedia system is built around the call session control function CSCF of which there are three types an interrogating CSCF I CSCF a proxy CSCF P CSCF and a serving CSCF S CSCF . The P CSCF is the MS s first point of contact with the IMS . The P CSCF forwards session initiation protocol SIP messages received from the MS to an SIP server in a home network and vice versa of the MS. The P CSCF can also modify an outgoing request according to a set of rules defined by the network operator e.g. address analysis and potential modification .

The I CSCF forms an entrance to a home network and hides the inner topology of the home network from other networks and provides flexibility for selecting an S CSCF. The I CSCF can contact a subscriber location function SLF to determine which HSS to use for the particular subscriber if multiple HSS are present. The S CSCF performs the session control services for the MS . This includes routing originating sessions to external networks and routing terminating sessions to visited networks. The S CSCF also decides whether an application server AS is required to receive information on an incoming SIP session request to ensure appropriate service handling. This decision is based on information received from the HSS or other sources such as an application server . The AS also communicates to a location server e.g. a Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC that provides a position e.g. latitude longitude coordinates of the MS .

The HSS contains a subscriber profile and keeps track of which core network node is currently handling the subscriber. It also supports subscriber authentication and authorization functions AAA . In networks with more than one HSS a subscriber location function provides information on the HSS that contains the profile of a given subscriber.

The MGCF provides interworking functionality between SIP session control signaling from the IMS and ISDN User Part ISUP Bearer Independent Call Control BICC call control signaling from the external GSTN networks not shown . It also controls the media gateway MGW that provides user plane interworking functionality e.g. converting between Adaptive Multi Rate AMR and Pulse code modulation PCM coded voice . The MGW also communicates with other IP multimedia networks .
