The present invention relates to a miniature circuit breaker linkage group and more particularly to a miniature circuit breaker with short circuit self locking function and a miniature circuit breaker with position state detection function.

For the power department the switch disconnecting device is essential to ensure electrical safety and circuit switching. With the launch of the national smart grid plan it is important for the miniature circuit breaker to stride forward towards intellectualization wherein it is an important utilization direction that the on off of the power line is controlled by the miniature circuit breaker group and how to achieve the automatic switch on off of the miniature circuit breaker group is a very important function. Currently the automatic switch on off of a single miniature circuit breaker can be generally achieved by the electrically operated mechanism. However the current electrically operated mechanism can only control the action of one miniature circuit breaker and can not control the actions of multiple miniature circuit breakers. Furthermore most electrically operated mechanisms achieve the switch on off function aiming at the big switch so that they have single function and low intelligent degree thus they can not meet the actual demands. More importantly the action and the position of the current electrically operated mechanism are mainly controlled by the linkage mechanism which often requires the motor to achieve the positive inversion function for controlling the switch on off thus resulting in the drawbacks of the relative large volume of the electrically operated mechanism and more complex linkage mechanism.

A docking chute is provided on the casing for adjusting the binding tightness. The connector can obtain the power and can also obtain a control signal. The obtained power signal can be a signal after antihypertensive treatment in the miniature circuit breaker and can also be an original phase line voltage which is correspondingly treated by the internal circuit of the miniature circuit breaker operation output device. An inspection switch is located on the casing and used in the need for maintenance.

When the closing operation or the breaking operation of the miniature circuit breaker reaches the specified position the control unit is triggered by the position state detection unit to stop the rotation of the motor. Due to the motor used as the transmission mode the motor makes a 360 degree rotation in the same direction at work. When the disc is driven by the motor to rotate the handle portion must be driven by the hand setting portion to rotate so that the linkage portion is driven to drive the handle of the miniature circuit breaker to swing thereby finally achieve the closing operation and the breaking operation of the miniature circuit breaker. When the closing operation and the breaking operation of the miniature circuit breaker reaches the specified position the motor must be controlled to stop the rotation.
