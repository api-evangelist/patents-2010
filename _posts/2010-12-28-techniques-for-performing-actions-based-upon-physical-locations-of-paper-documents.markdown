The number of paper documents used in commercial and non commercial environments has increased substantially with the proliferation of copiers printers facsimile machines and other paper document producing devices. As a result the ability to track physical locations of paper documents is of great importance especially in an office environment. In addition to tracking the locations of paper documents users also frequently need to perform one or more actions based on the physical locations of the paper documents. Conventionally available systems do not provide the ability to track or perform actions based on physical locations of paper documents.

In light of the above there is a need for techniques that facilitate the tracking of paper documents and the performance of actions based upon physical locations of the paper documents.

Further due to the widespread use of computers and other data processing systems an increasing amount of information is now being stored in digital or electronic form. For example electronic information is stored in the form of electronic documents such as files etc. Examples of electronic documents include documents created using application programs such as word processors email programs image editors etc. scanned images of paper documents documents stored in various formats such as PDF Postscript etc. and other types of documents stored in electronic form.

The vast number of electronic documents coupled with the proliferation of paper document output devices such as copiers printers and facsimile machines has also greatly increased the number of paper documents that are generated using the electronic documents.

Due to the large number of electronic documents and paper documents it becomes very difficult to identify an electronic document corresponding to a particular paper document. The problem is particularly acute in office environments. Most office users have had the experience of spending a great amount of time trying to locate an electronic document corresponding to a particular paper document.

As a result the ability to locate electronic documents corresponding to paper documents is of great importance especially in an office environment.

Further containers are widely used to store objects. Examples of containers include boxes cabinets cupboards shelves storage racks etc. used in office environments to store a variety of objects including documents books stationery and several other objects a briefcase or bag used by a person a toolbox used by a handyman to store tools etc. storage containers used for transportation purposes and other types of containers.

A common problem shared by all containers is that there is no easy way of automatically determining the contents of a container. In order to determine the contents of a container a user has to manually peruse through the objects stored in the container. This process of manually determining the contents of a container can be extremely time consuming and frustrating especially when a container stores several items. For example it may take a user a lot of time to determine the contents of a box of documents.

Several techniques have been developed to ease the task of determining objects stored in a container. However most of these techniques still require significant manual effort and lack the automation and convenience desired by users. There is therefore a need for techniques that automate and simplify the task of determining the contents of a container.

Further in any project involving a group of people cooperative and coordinated interaction typically is key to the success or failure of the undertaking The project begins with a series of meetings to identify the desired goals and to begin understanding the tasks needed to achieve the goal. In a marketing situation for example product managers and sales persons convene frequently to define the product line or services to identify potential markets and target customers to develop advertising strategies and product roll out scenarios and so on. In an engineering setting basic design goals and basic implementation strategies are discussed and identified.

An important though somewhat tedious outcome of this effort is the production of many documents. Most documents are freely distributed among individuals. Invariably however a number of documents will be produce that contain sensitive information. Engineering plans and designs might have to be documented but kept secret or otherwise secured. Marketing plans and forecasts and customer lists are typically sensitive subject matter that require controlled access.

These sensitive documents nonetheless need to be copied distributed and otherwise disseminated among many individuals in the organization in order for progress to occur. A need therefore exists for a method and system to provide document security support.

Further during the course of running a business there are many steps and people involved in each endeavor. Accompanying this activity might be the flow of large numbers of documentation. For example documents generated by a person or by people in a workgroup often require distribution to other people in the company or among different groups of people. Workflow systems provide a way for managing the flow of numerous documents during the course of a project.

Any substantial project is likely to produce volumes of paperwork. Effective management of a large scale project requires up to date information. In the case of documents it is important to know who has what document how far along a document is in the review process and so on. This can facilitate identifying critical paths and bottlenecks. It is therefore desirable to be able to enhance a workflow system to improve its utility.

The foregoing together with other features embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent when referring to the following specification claims and accompanying drawings.

Certain embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for performing one or more actions based upon physical locations of one or more paper documents. For purposes of this invention the term paper document is intended to refer to a document comprising one or more pages of any tangible medium on which information can be printed written drawn imprinted embossed etc. For example a paper document may refer to a document printed by a printer a document output by a copier or scanner a document output by a facsimile machine a photograph a book a single page of paper a document comprising a plurality of papers and the like. In alternative embodiments the teachings of the present invention may also be applied to other types of objects.

For purposes of this invention the term electronic document is intended to refer to information stored in an electronic or digital form. Examples of electronic documents include files documents created using application programs such as word processors email programs image editors etc. scanned images of paper documents documents stored in various formats such as PDF Postscript etc. and other types of documents stored in electronic form.

According to the teachings of the present invention actions are performed based upon physical locations of paper documents that have identification tags physically associated with them. Each identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is configured to store information that facilitates identification of the physical location of the paper document. The information stored in the identification tag is also used to perform actions based upon the physical location of the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention each identification tag stores information that can be used to uniquely identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. For example an identification tag may store an identification code that may be used to uniquely identify a paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. It should be understood that other types of information that can be used to identify documents might also be stored in an identification tag in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

Depending upon the type of identification tag used the identification code information may be stored in the memory of the identification tag when the tag is manufactured when the tag is activated or at some later time using software or hardware techniques. For example a paper document output device may be configured to store a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag that physically associated with a paper document or is selected to be physically associated with a paper document generated by the paper document processing device.

In addition to identification code information other types of information related to a paper document may also be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. For example the information stored in an identification tag may include an electronic representation of the contents of the paper document e.g. a scanned image of the paper document a Postscript format file or Portable Document Format PDF or image format or other file format etc. information identifying the author of the paper document the date when the paper document was created the number of pages in the paper document and other like information. Other information that can be stored in an identification tag is described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10 235 035 10 235 042 10 235 032 10 235 030 10 234 414 the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Various devices known to those skilled in the art may be used as identification tags. A device that can be used as an identification tag generally includes an on device memory that is capable of storing information that can be read by a tag reader. As previously indicated depending on the type of identification tag used the information e.g. identification code information stored in the identification tag may be stored in the memory of the identification tag when the tag is manufactured when the tag is activated or at some later time using software or hardware programming applications.

Various different types of tag readers may be used to read information stored by identification tags. The type of tag reader used and the technique used by the tag reader for reading the information stored on an identification tag depends on the type of the identification tag. According to an embodiment of the present invention a tag reader may read information from an identification tag by scanning the identification tag. In other embodiments a tag reader may read the information by receiving the information from the identification tag. A tag reader may receive the information from an identification tag in response to an external stimulus e.g. electromagnetic energy or signal provided to the identification tag. The external stimulus or signal may be provided by the tag reader or by some other device or application. If the identification tag is self powered the identification tag may be configured to communicate the information stored by the identification tag to the tag reader. A tag reader may read the information stored by a tag reader in various forms including electromagnetic waves electronic signals acoustic signals etc.

According to an embodiment of the present invention radio frequency identification devices RFIDs may be used as identification tags. For example the Mu chip manufactured by Hitachi Ltd. may be used as an identification tag. The Mu chip is a radio recognition IC chip that measures 0.4 mm square and is 60 microns thick in its present embodiment. Due to its reduced size the Mu chip can be embedded in paper. The Mu chip comprises an on chip memory presently a 128 bit ROM that can be programmed to store information such as the identification code for a paper document.

In its present embodiment information stored by a Hitachi Mu chip can be read by exposing the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves. The Mu chip uses the microwave energy as a power source and communicates the information stored in the on chip memory in the form of radio waves that can be detected and read by a tag reader. In alternative embodiments the Mu chip may also include an on chip antenna to increase the communication distance range. In yet other embodiments a power source may be provided on the Mu chip and the Mu chip may be programmed to communicate the information stored by the Mu chip to a tag reader.

As indicated above according to the teachings of the present invention an identification tag is physically associated with a paper document. Various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document. The identification tag may be permanently or temporarily attached to a paper document or a page of the paper document. The tag may be attached to the paper document using clips staples adhesives ties strings rubber bands labels with identification tags and the like. The identification tag may be embedded in a page of the paper document. An identification tag may also be incorporated into an object such as a label a staple etc. that is attached to the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention an identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document at the time the paper document is generated or produced. In this embodiment the tag may be physically associated with the paper document by the device referred to as a paper document output device that produces or generates the paper document. Examples of paper document output devices include printers scanners copiers facsimile machines and the like. For example a copier may be configured to physically associate an identification tag to a photocopy generated by the copier. Likewise a printer may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document printout generated by the printer. A facsimile machine may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document facsimile output. Likewise other paper document output devices may be configured to physically associate identification tags with paper documents generated by the devices.

As described above various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document. According to one technique depending on the size of the identification tag the identification tag is embedded in a page of the paper document. For example the Mu chip due to its reduced size can be embedded in a paper page. A paper page that has an identification tag embedded in it may be referred to as tagged paper . Accordingly in an embodiment using Hitachi Mu chips as identification tags a paper document output device may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document by using at least one tagged paper to generate the paper document. Accordingly if a paper document output device has access to tagged paper the paper document output device may use one or more of the tagged papers to generate the paper document.

An identification tag may also be physically associated with a paper document by physically applying or attaching the identification tag to the paper document. An identification tag may also be physically associated with a paper document generated by a paper document output device using an adhesive a clip a staple a rubber band a tie or other like mechanism. The identification tag may also be incorporated into an object e.g. a staple a clip etc. that is attached to the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention an identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document by mixing the identification tag in the ink that is printed on one or more pages of the paper document.

In alternative embodiments a paper document output device may dispense a sticker or label comprising an identification tag. The identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document generated by a paper document output device by applying the sticker or label to the paper document. For example a copier may dispense a label comprising an identification tag and a user may be requested to apply the dispensed label to a photocopy generated by the copier. Various other techniques may also be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention if the size of the identification tag permits the identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of the paper document. For example the identification tag may be embedded in a page of the paper document the identification tag may be embedded or mounted on a staple that is attached to the paper document.

According to the teachings of the present invention in addition to physically associating an identification tag with a paper document a paper document output device is also configured to read information including identification code information from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by the paper document output device. For example a copier is configured to read identification code information stored in the memory of an identification tag that is physically associated with a photocopy generated by the copier.

The information read from an identification tag may then be stored. According to an embodiment of the present invention the identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is stored along with other information related to the paper document referred to as paper document related information . The information for a paper document is stored such that the paper document related information for the paper document is associated with the identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with paper document. The information is stored such that the paper document related information can be retrieved given the identification code for the paper document.

The paper document related information that is associated with a particular identification code identifying a particular paper document may include various types of information related to the particular paper document. The paper document related information may include information read from identification tags and other information. For a particular identification code paper document related information associated with the identification code may include an electronic representation of the paper document e.g. scanned images of the paper document electronic document corresponding to the paper document etc. identified by the identification code information identifying the paper document e.g. title of the paper document etc. information identifying an electronic representation of the paper document e.g. a filename directory location etc. electronic document information described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10 235 042 information identifying the physical location of the paper document described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10 235 035 and other information. The paper document related information may also include information identifying another document related to the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the identification code information and the paper document related information is stored in a database referred to as the paper document tracking database . The information in the paper document tracking database may be indexed by the identification code information. In one embodiment paper document tracking database may be implemented as a table wherein each row of the table stores information related to a particular identification code. Each row or record of paper document tracking database may store paper document related information corresponding to the identification code. The paper document tracking database thus stores information identifying one or more identification codes and corresponding paper document related information for each identification code. Information stored in the paper document tracking database is used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents.

It should be understood that various other techniques may be used for storing identification code information and the corresponding paper document related information. For example the information may be stored in a file in one or more data structures and the like. The information may be stored in a memory location accessible to the paper document output device. The memory used for storing the information may be part of the paper document output device or may be part of another system or device coupled to the paper document output device.

As described above a paper document output device such as a copier may be configured to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document and read and store information that is used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents. is a simplified block diagram of a network environment comprising a copier that is configured to physically associate identification tags with paper documents according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in copier is coupled to network via communication links . A data processing system may be also be coupled to network via communication links . Network environment depicted in is merely illustrative of an environment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.

As shown in copier includes a processor that communicates with a number of peripheral subsystems via a bus subsystem . These peripheral subsystems may include a storage subsystem a user interface subsystem a network interface subsystem a scanner subsystem a print subsystem and a tag subsystem .

Bus subsystem provides a mechanism for letting the various components and subsystems of copier communicate with each other as intended. Although bus subsystem is shown schematically as a single bus alternative embodiments of the bus subsystem may utilize multiple buses.

User interface subsystem allows user interaction with copier . A user may be a human user a device a process another computer and the like. User interface subsystem may be implemented using a touch pad a touch screen mechanical buttons application programming interfaces APIs and the like. Interface allows the user to select options for generating a photocopy from an original document . For example interface may allow the user to select the paper size to be used for generating the photocopy the copy darkness the copy contrast number of copies to be produced magnification reduction ratio and other like options known to those skilled in the art. A Copy Start key that allows the user to initiate the copying function may also be provided by interface . Copier accepts a document also referred to as the original document and prints a copy or photocopy upon selection of the Start Copy key.

According to an embodiment of the present invention interface may also allow the user to select if an identification tag is to be physically associated with photocopy paper document . For example before photocopying a original document interface may prompt the user to select whether an identification tag is to be physically associated with the photocopy. An identification tag is then physically associated with the photocopy paper document if selected by the user.

In an alternative embodiment of the present invention an identification tag may be physically associated with the photocopy without prompting the user. In this embodiment of the present invention activation of the Copy Start key by the user is sufficient to initiate the photocopying function cause physical association of an identification tag with the photocopy paper document and cause reading and archival of the identification code and potentially other information stored by the identification tag read from the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. Depressing the Copy Start key represents a single user command that is interpreted by copier to request both copying physically associating the identification tag and reading and archival of information stored by the identification tag. In this embodiment the user may not be aware that an identification tag has been physically associated with the photocopy produced by copier and that the identification code read from the identification tag and information related to the photocopy has been automatically archived by copier .

User interface subsystem also serves as an interface for outputting information to the user. For example information related to the status of copier or information related to the functions performed by copier may be output to the user via interface .

Network interface subsystem provides an interface to other computer systems e.g. data processing system networks and devices. Embodiments of network interface subsystem include an Ethernet card a modem telephone satellite cable ISDN etc. asynchronous digital subscriber line DSL units and the like. Network interface system facilitates transfer of information to and from copier in an appropriate format.

Processor performs or controls the functions performed by the various subsystems of copier . These functions include physically associating identification tags with photocopies reading information from identification tags and archiving the read information. According to an embodiment of the present invention processor executes a control program that controls operation of copier .

Storage subsystem may be configured to store the basic programming and data constructs that provide the functionality of copier . For example according to an embodiment of the present invention software modules and control programs implementing the functionality of copier may be stored in storage subsystem . Processor may execute these software modules. Storage subsystem may also provide a repository or database for storing information according to the teachings of the present invention. For example the identification code information and corresponding paper document related information may be stored in storage subsystem . It should be understood that the actual archival of identification codes information and photocopy documents related information may occur either locally i.e. in storage subsystem or remotely on some other system. For example according to an embodiment of the present invention copier may communicate the information to data processing system that may then store the information.

Scanner subsystem includes a scanner and an image processing unit . Scanner is configured to capture an image of original document and transmit the image to image processing unit . Image processing unit operates to remove distortion inherent in the scanning process. The output of the image processing unit is a scanned image of original document with the distortion removed. The scanned image is then forwarded to print subsystem for further processing via video bus .

According to an embodiment of the present invention an image data tap provides processor with access to scanned image data transferred over video bus . In alternative embodiments of the present invention the image scanned by scanner may be provided to processor by scanner subsystem .

Print subsystem operates in accordance with well known laser xerography principles and is configured to receive scanned information from scanner subsystem and produce a paper document photocopy of original document . Print engine operates in synchrony with tag subsystem to ensure that an identification tag is appropriately physically associated with photocopy and information from the identification tag is read and stored.

Tag subsystem is configured to physically associate identification tags with photocopies generated by copier . As described above various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a photocopy paper document. For example at least one tagged paper e.g. paper with an identification tag such as the Hitachi Mu chip embedded in it may be used to generate photocopy . According to an embodiment of the present invention tag subsystem ensures that at least one tagged page is used to generate photocopy . If the photocopy consists of multiple pages then normal paper pages i.e. paper pages without the embedded identification tag may be used for other pages of the photocopy paper document.

An identification tag may also be physically applied or attached to paper document . If the size of the identification tag permits the identification tag may be attached to the paper document photocopy such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of paper document . For example tag subsystem may attach a staple with an identification tag embedded in it or mounted on it to photocopy document . The identification tag may also be attached to the photocopy paper document by mixing it in the ink that is printed on the photocopy when the photocopy is generated by print subsystem . The identification tag may also be applied to the photocopy paper document using an adhesive e.g. a sticker comprising the identification tag may be applied to a page of the photocopy . Various other techniques may also be used to physically associate an identification tag with the paper document.

As previously described each identification tag may store a unique identification code that is used to identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. The identification code may be programmed into the identification tag when the identification tag is manufactured or activated. According to an embodiment of the present invention tag subsystem is configured to store a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag that is selected to be physically associated with photocopy or has already been physically associated with photocopy . Hardware or software modules configured to program the identification tag may be incorporated in tag subsystem .

If the identification code is already stored in identification tags used by copier tag subsystem is configured to read the identification code from an identification tag that has been physically associated with photocopy paper document generated by copier or that is selected to be physically associated with photocopy document . One or more tag readers may be incorporated in tag subsystem to facilitate reading of the identification code information and other information from identification tags.

The type of tag readers used and the techniques used for reading information from identification tags depends on the type of identification tags. For example if a Hitachi Mu chip is used as an identification tag tag readers included in tag subsystem may be constructed to expose each identification tag to 2.45 GHz band of microwaves and to detect and read radio waves emanating from the identification tag. Various other types of tag readers that are capable of detecting electromagnetic optical acoustical or other signals may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention using other forms of identification tags.

It should be understood that in addition to identification code information other information stored in identification tags used by copier may also be read by tag readers . The information read from the identification tags is then stored in a paper document tracking database. The information may be locally stored by copier e.g. in storage subsystem . Alternatively the information may be forwarded to data processing system for storage or may be stored on some other computer system or storage device accessible to copier .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the scanned image output of scanner subsystem is stored along with the identification code information. The scanned image of an original paper document is stored as part of the paper document related information that is associated with an identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with a photocopy generated from the original paper document.

The various subsystems of copier function in synchrony to ensure proper functioning of copier according to the teachings of the present invention. Various synchronization signals known to those skilled in the art may be used to achieve this synchronization. Many other configurations of copier are possible having more or fewer components than the system depicted in .

As indicated above according to the teachings of the present invention the information stored in the paper document tracking database is used to determine physical locations of paper documents that have an identification tag physically associated with them and to perform actions based upon the physical locations. is a simplified block diagram of a distributed system that may be used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents according to an embodiment of the present invention. The configuration depicted in is merely illustrative of an environment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in system comprises a plurality of tag readers TRs devices and a user system coupled to a data processing system via communication links . Communication links depicted in may be of various types including hardwire links optical links satellite or other wireless communication links wave propagation links or any other mechanisms for communication of information. Various communication protocols may be used to facilitate communication of information via the communication links. These communication protocols may include TCP IP HTTP protocols extensible markup language XML wireless application protocol WAP protocols under development by industry standard organizations vendor specific protocols customized protocols and others.

Tag readers are configured to read information including identification code information stored by identification tags that are physically associated with one or more paper documents and to facilitate determination of physical locations of the one or more paper documents. Whether or not a tag reader can read identification code from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document depends on the proximity of the paper document to the tag reader. If an identification tag has an on board power supply e.g. an on board battery and is capable of communicating information including identification code information stored in the memory of the identification tag a tag reader can detect and read the identification code from the identification tag if the reception range of the tag reader overlaps with the communication range of the identification tag.

If an identification tag does not have its own power supply and depends on power supplied by an external entity such as a tag reader then a tag reader is able to read information including identification code information from the identification tag if the tag reader can expose the identification tag to the requisite energy and can read the information transmitted or radiated by the identification tag in response to the energy. For example if a Hitachi Mu chip is used as an identification tag a tag reader can read information stored by the Mu chip if the tag reader is able to expose the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves and is able to read the radio waves that emanate from the irradiated Mu chip identification tag.

The manner in which a tag reader reads the identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag used. Likewise a tag reader s ability to detect and read identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag and the proximity of the identification tag to the tag reader.

A tag reader is thus able to read information stored by an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document if the paper document is physically located proximal or near to the tag reader i.e. the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document is at a distance from the tag reader where the tag reader can read information stored by the identification tag . It should be understood that multiple tag readers may be able to read information stored by a particular identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document that is located proximal to the tag readers i.e. at a distance from where the tag readers can read information from the identification tag physically associated with the paper document .

For example in the embodiment depicted in tag reader is able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with paper document PD . Tag readers and can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag reader is also able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag readers and can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document .

Since a tag reader is thus able to read information stored by an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document if the paper document is physically located proximal or near to the tag reader the physical location of a particular paper document can be approximated to be the same as the physical location of a tag reader. Accordingly the physical location of the paper document can be determined based on the physical location of the tag reader. If multiple tag readers are able to read information from an identification tag associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located in a location or zone proximal to the multiple tag readers. As described below data processing system is configured to receive information read by the individual tag readers from the identification tags and to determine the physical locations of the paper documents corresponding to the identification tags.

According to an embodiment of the present invention tag readers may be configured to send out signals at periodic time intervals to interrogate and read information including identification code information from identification tags that the tag readers can detect and read. In alternative embodiments a tag reader may be configured to interrogate identification tags that are proximal to the tag reader in response to a signal received from an external system device or application or in response to external stimuli. For example a tag reader may be configured to interrogate identification tags that are proximal to the tag reader upon receiving a signal from data processing system .

In addition to the identification code information a tag reader may also be configured to read other information stored in an identification tag interrogated by the tag reader. According to an embodiment of the present invention tag reader may timestamp the read information to indicate when e.g. date and time the information was read. The read information may then be stored. The information may be stored by the tag reader or may be forwarded by the tag reader to a central database or computer system e.g. data processing system that may store and or process the information.

Data processing system is configured to process requests received from user system to perform one or more actions based upon physical locations of paper documents in distributed system . Data processing system uses information received from tag readers to process the requests.

According to an embodiment of the present invention upon receiving a request to perform an action data processing system causes tag readers to interrogate identification tags physically associated with paper documents that are located proximal to the tag readers and can be detected and read by the tag readers. The tag readers are configured to interrogate identification tags and communicate information read from the identification tags which includes identification code information to data processing system . Data processing system then analyzes the information and determines physical locations of paper documents identified by the identification codes received from the tag readers.

As described above if a particular tag reader is able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with a particular paper document that implies indicates that the particular paper document is physically located proximal to the particular tag reader. The physical location of the paper document can be then determined based on the physical location of the tag reader. Accordingly in order to determine physical locations of the paper documents for each tag reader from whom identification code information is received data processing system first determines the physical location of the tag reader.

According to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system stores or has access to information referred to as tag reader location information identifying physical locations of one or more tag readers in distributed system . For example the tag reader location information may indicate that tag reader is located in John s office tag reader is located in John s briefcase tag readers and are located in the conference room tag reader is located on Mr. Smith s office desk tag reader is located in Mr. Smith s in box container in his office and so on.

Data processing system uses the tag reader location information to determine physical locations of tag readers that are able to read one or more identification codes from identification tags. The physical location of a paper document identified by an identification code read by tag reader is then determined based upon the physical location of a tag reader. For example if tag reader is able to read information from an identification tag that is physically associated with paper document then the physical location of paper document is determined to be the same as the physical location of tag reader .

One or more actions requested by the action request received from user system may then be performed based upon the physical locations of the paper documents. According to an embodiment of the present invention the actions may be performed using the paper document related information stored in the paper document tracking database. As described earlier the paper document tracking database stores information identifying identification codes and paper document related information corresponding to the identification codes.

Data processing system may determine paper document related information corresponding to each identification code read by the tag readers and perform an action using the paper document related information.

The action specified in a request may be performed by data processing system by some device upon receiving a signal from data processing system to perform the action or by data processing system in combination with some other device. As described below various different kinds of actions may be performed. Examples of actions include emailing faxing copying printing and other types of actions.

A user may configure a request to perform an action using user system . A user interface may be displayed on user system that allows the user to configure the request. User system may be a personal computer a portable computer a workstation a computer terminal a network computer a kiosk a personal digital assistant PDA a communication device such as a cell phone or any other data processing system. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments of the present invention a user might also use input devices coupled to data processing system to configure a request.

The information contained in a request may specify the one or more actions to be performed and the criteria involving physical locations of paper documents for performing the actions. Various different types of requests may be received.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a request received by data processing system specifies that one or more actions be performed using paper document related information corresponding to one or more paper documents that are physically located at a specified particular physical location. A physical location may correspond to a zone or area in which a paper document may be located.

As depicted in processing is initiated when data processing system receives a request comprising information specifying a particular physical location and requesting that one or more actions be performed on information related to paper documents that are located at the particular physical location step . The request may be received from various sources. According to an embodiment of the present invention the request is received from user system . The request may also be configured by a user interacting with data processing system . It should be understood that one or more physical locations might be specified in the request.

There are various ways in which a user may specify the physical location. According to an embodiment of the present invention the physical location may correspond to a zone or area e.g. John s office a particular conference room Mr. Smith s office desk Mr. Smith s in box container in his office Mr. Smith s briefcase and so on. Other types of coordinates may also be used for specifying a physical location. According to an embodiment of the present invention a user may specify a physical location by identifying one or more tag readers located at the physical location. In this embodiment a user interface may be displayed to the user displaying the various tag readers deployed in the system and physical locations of the tag readers. A user via the user interface can then specify a physical location by selecting one or more tag readers located at the physical location.

In addition to specifying a physical location a request received in step also specifies one or more actions to be performed. If multiple physical locations are specified in the request then one or more actions may be specified for each physical location. Examples of requests include a fax contents of all paper documents located in Mr. Smith s in box to John b make copies of paper documents in the conference room c print one copy of every document in John s office d compose and send an email to John Doe comprising electronic versions of paper documents located in Mary s briefcase and on Mary s desk e and the like.

Data processing system then determines one or more tag readers corresponding to the physical location specified in the request received in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system uses the tag reader location information to determine one or more tag readers corresponding to the user specified physical location. For example if the user has specified Mr. Smith s office desk then tag reader from the previous example is identified in step . If multiple physical locations are specified in the request then in step tag readers for each of the specified physical locations are determined. It should be understood that step may not be needed if the user has specified the physical location by selecting one or more tag readers.

Data processing system then sends a signal to each tag reader identified in step to read identification code information and other information from identification tags physically associated with one or more paper documents that the tag reader can detect and read step . As described above if a particular tag reader identified in step is able to read an identification code from an identification tag physically associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located proximal to the tag reader.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention the tag readers may be configured to forward information read from the identification tags to data processing system at periodic time intervals. In these embodiments step may not be needed.

Data processing system then receives identification code information and other information read by the tag readers identified in step step .

Data processing system then determines paper document related information corresponding to each identification code received from the tag readers in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention information stored in the paper document tracking database is used to determine paper document related information for the identification codes received from the tag readers. The paper document tracking database is searched to identify records whose identification codes match the identification codes read by the tag readers. Paper document related information for the identification codes is then determined from the matching records.

In alternative embodiments the paper document related information for a paper document may be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document and may be read by the tag readers along with the identification code information. For such a paper document data processing system may receive the paper document related information along with the identification code information for the document in step . In this scenario data processing system need not query the paper document tracking database to determine paper document related information for the paper document since the paper document related information is read directly from an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document.

As previously described the paper document related information corresponding to an identification code may comprise or store a pointer to a representation of the contents of the particular paper document e.g. scanned images of the paper document electronic document corresponding to the paper document information identifying the paper document e.g. title of the paper document etc. information identifying an electronic representation of the paper document e.g. a filename directory location etc. and the like. The paper document related information may also include information identifying another document related to the paper document.

One or more actions specified in the request received in step are then performed using the paper document related information determined for the one or more identification codes received from the tag readers in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention an action is performed using paper document related information determined for at least one paper document located in the physical location specified in the request.

As indicated above the paper document related information corresponding to an identification code may be determined from the paper document tracking database. The paper document related information may also be read from the identification tags along with the identification code and received from the tag readers. The actions may be performed by data processing system by devices coupled to data processing system or by data processing system in collaboration with one or more devices or by other systems or devices.

Various different kinds of actions may be performed including emailing faxing copying printing or any other action using the paper document related information or a portion thereof. For example if the paper document related information corresponding to an identification code includes an electronic representation of a paper document the electronic representation may be emailed to an addressee specified in the request received in step . Likewise if the paper document related information corresponding to an identification code includes a scanned image of the paper document the scanned image may be printed on a printer specified in the request. Various other types of actions may also be performed using the paper document related information corresponding to identification codes read by the tag readers.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the present invention stores information identifying actions that have been performed for a paper document identified by a particular identification code. The actions related information may be stored in paper document tracking database and associated with the particular identification code. For example if the paper document related information corresponding to the particular identification code was faxed the following action related information may be stored in the paper document tracking database and associated with the particular identification code 

As shown above the action related information identifies an action that was performed the date when the action was performed and the time when the action was performed. It should be understood that the action related information may comprise other types of information in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

By storing action related information for each action performed for an identification code information identifying a history of actions performed for the paper document identified by the identification code may be stored.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the actions related information may also be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document. In this embodiment the identification tag can be scanned to determine actions that have been performed on paper document related information corresponding to the paper document to which the identification tag is attached. In this embodiment the paper document represents an autonomous document that stores information identifying actions that have been performed on the document.

As described above depicts a method for processing a request received by data processing system that identifies one or more physical locations and actions to be performed using paper document related information corresponding to paper documents physically located at the specified one or more locations. Various other types of requests may be received by data processing system . According to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system receives a request that specifies selection criteria and one or more actions to be performed if the selection criteria is satisfied.

As depicted in processing is initiated when data processing system receives a request that specifies a selection criterion and one or more actions to be performed if the selection criterion is satisfied step . The request may be received from various sources. For example the request may be received from user system or may be configured by a user interacting with data processing system .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the selection criterion includes information identifying one or more physical locations and one or more conditions associated with each physical location. The one or more actions specified in the request are performed based upon the extent to which the conditions associated with the specified physical locations are satisfied. Various different notations and techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used to specify the selection criteria and actions.

Data processing system analyzes the request received in step to identify one or more physical locations specified in the selection criterion of the request step . Various different processing techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used to analyze the request to identify one or more physical locations specified in the request.

Data processing system then analyzes the request received in step to identify one or more conditions associated with each physical location determined in step step . Various different processing techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used to analyze the request to identify one or more conditions associated with each physical location specified in the request.

Data processing system then determines one or more tag readers corresponding to each physical location determined in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system uses the tag reader location information to determine one or more tag readers corresponding to the user specified physical locations. For example if the user specified physical location is John s in box then data processing system uses the tag reader location information to identify one or more tag readers corresponding to or located proximal to John s in box.

As previously described a user may also specify a physical location by selecting one or more tag readers. In this scenario step may not be performed.

Data processing system then sends a signal to each tag reader identified in step to read identification code information and other information from identification tags physically associated with paper documents that the tag reader can detect and read step . As described above if a particular tag reader identified in step is able to read an identification code from an identification tag associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located proximal to the tag reader.

Data processing system then receives identification code information and other information read by the tag readers identified in step and to whom the signal was sent in step step . In alternative embodiments of the present invention the tag readers may be configured to forward information read from the identification tags to data processing system at periodic time intervals. In these embodiments step may be omitted.

Data processing system then determines based upon information in the paper document tracking database paper document related information corresponding to each identification code received from the tag readers in step step . As previously described the paper document related information corresponding to an identification code may comprise or store a pointer to a representation of the contents of the particular paper document e.g. scanned images of the paper document electronic document corresponding to the paper document information identifying the paper document e.g. title of the paper document etc. information identifying an electronic representation of the paper document e.g. a filename directory location etc. and the like. The paper document related information may also include information identifying another document related to the paper document.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention if the paper document related information is stored in identification tags the paper document related information for an identification code may be read by one or more tag readers identified in step and may be received along with the identification code information in step . In this scenario there is no need to access the paper document tracking database to determine paper document related information.

Based upon the information determined in step or information received in step data processing system determines if the selection criterion specified in the request received in step is satisfied step . According to an embodiment of the present invention in step data processing system determines if the one or more conditions identified in step associated with each physical location determined in step are satisfied. Various types of processing may be used to determine if the conditions associated with the physical locations are satisfied. For example if a condition involves determining a characteristic e.g. title of a document e.g. If John s office contains a document titled Project Plans for 2002 and the paper document related information determined in step includes a scanned image of the paper document then image processing techniques may be applied to the scanned image to determine the characteristic e.g. title of the paper document. Data processing system may then determine if the condition is satisfied. Various other types of processing may also be performed.

Conditions involving the physical presence of a paper document in a particular physical location e.g. if paper document doc1 is located in John s in box may be evaluated by determining if a tag reader corresponding to the physical location was able to read identification code corresponding to the particular paper document. In addition to the identification code information the paper document related information related to the identification code may be used to determine the identity of the paper document. If none of the tag readers corresponding to the physical location were able to read identification code corresponding to the particular paper document then the condition is deemed not to be satisfied i.e. the specified document could not be located at the specified physical location .

Whether or not the one or more actions specified in the request received in step are performed depends upon the extent to which the selection criterion is deemed satisfied. If the selection criterion comprises Boolean connectors that used to connect the various conditions associated with one or more physical locations then Boolean logic may be used to determine if the action specified by the request is to be performed.

If it is determined in step that the selection criteria is not satisfied then a message may be output to the user indicating that the one or more actions specified in the request were not performed step . Information identifying one or more reasons for not performing the actions may also be output to the user in step .

If it is determined in step that the selection criterion has been satisfied then the one or more actions specified in the request are performed step . The actions may be performed using information determined in step or using other information. For example for the example request If Paper document doc1 is located in John s in box container fax document doc1 to Mary doc1 is faxed to Mary if paper document doc1 is located in John s in box container. The actions may be performed by data processing system by devices coupled to data processing system by data processing system in collaboration with one or more devices or by other data processing systems or devices.

As described above information identifying the actions performed may be stored in paper document tracking database or in identification tags that are physically associated with paper documents identified by identification code information received in step .

Each identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is configured to store information that can be used to uniquely identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. For a particular paper document the identification tag physically associated with the particular paper document along with information stored in the identification tag facilitates tracking of the physical location of the particular paper document.

As described above each identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document stored information can be used to uniquely identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. The information stored in the identification tag may be of various types. According to an embodiment of the present invention a unique identification code is stored in an identification tag. In this embodiment the unique identification code is used to identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. It should be understood that other types of information that can be used to identity documents might also be stored in an identification tag in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

In addition to information that is used to identify a paper document other information related to the paper document may also be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. For example according to an embodiment of the present invention an electronic representation of the contents of the paper document e.g. a scanned image of the paper document a Postscript format file or Portable Document Format PDF or image format or other format file used for generating the paper document electronic contents of the paper document or portions thereof etc. may be stored in an identification tag physically associated with the paper document. Other types of information such as information identifying the author of the paper document the date when the paper document was created the number of pages in the paper document and other like information may also be stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. Other types of information that can be stored in an identification tag is described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10 235 042 10 235 032 10 235 028 10 235 030 10 234 414 the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Various devices known to those skilled in the art may be used as identification tags. According to an embodiment of the present invention an identification tag device includes an on device memory that is capable of storing information related to the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated.

Various tag readers may be configured to read the information stored by the identification tag.

According to an embodiment of the present invention in order to track the physical location of a paper document a tag reader is configured to read the information stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. A tag reader may use various different techniques to read information from an identification tag. According to an embodiment of the present invention a tag reader may read information from an identification tag by scanning the identification tag. In other embodiments a tag reader may read the information by receiving the information from the identification tag. A tag reader may receive the information from an identification tag in response to an external stimulus e.g. electromagnetic energy or signal provided to the identification tag. The external stimulus or signal may be provided by the tag reader or by some other device or application. If the identification tag is self powered the identification tag may be configured to communicate the information stored by the identification tag to the tag reader. A tag reader may read the information stored by a tag reader in various forms including electromagnetic waves electronic signals acoustic signals etc.

According to an embodiment of the present invention radio frequency identification devices RFIDs are used as identification tags. For example the Mu chip manufactured by Hitachi Ltd. may be used as an identification tag. The Mu chip is a radio recognition IC chip that measures 0.4 mm square and is 60 microns thick in its present embodiment. Due to its reduced size the Mu chip can be embedded into paper. The Mu chip comprises an on chip memory presently a 128 bit ROM that can be programmed to store information e.g. an identification code that can be used to identify a paper document. In its present embodiment a tag reader can read information stored by a Mu chip by exposing the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves. The Mu chip uses the microwave energy as a power source and communicates the information stored in the on chip memory in the form of radio waves that can be detected and read by a tag reader. In alternative embodiments the Mu chip may also include an on chip antenna to increase the communication distance range. In yet other embodiments a power source may be provided on the Mu chip and the Mu chip may be programmed to communicate the information stored by the Mu chip to a tag reader.

Various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document. According to one technique depending on the size of the identification tag the identification tag is embedded in a page of the paper document. For example a Mu chip due to its reduced size can be embedded in a page of the paper document. A paper page that has an identification tag embedded in it may be referred to as tagged paper . In this embodiment a paper document may include at least one page that has an identification tag embedded in it. According to an embodiment of the present invention if the paper document output device has access to tagged paper the paper document output device may use one or more of the tagged papers to generate the paper document.

The identification tag may also be permanently or temporarily attached to a paper document. The tag may be attached to the paper document using clips staples adhesives ties strings rubber bands labels with identification tags and the like. An identification tag may also be incorporated into an object such as a label a staple etc. that is attached to the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention an identification tag is physically associated with a paper document at the time the paper document is generated or produced. A device that generates or produces a paper document may be referred to as a paper document output device . Accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention the identification tag is physically associated with a paper document by the paper document output device that is used to produce or generate the paper document. Examples of paper document output devices include printers scanners copiers facsimile machines cameras that are capable of printing photos and the like.

For example according to an embodiment of the present invention a copier may be configured to physically associate an identification tag with a photocopy paper document produced by the copier. Likewise a printer may be configured to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document printed by the printer. A facsimile machine may be configured to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document facsimile output. Likewise other paper document output devices may be configured to physically associate identification tags with paper documents when the paper document output devices generate the paper documents.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a paper document output device is configured to automatically physically associate an identification tag with a paper document generated by the paper document output device when the paper document output device produces the paper document. For example if the paper document output device has access to tagged paper the paper document output device may automatically use one or more of the tagged papers to generate the paper document. In other embodiments the paper document output device may be configured to dispense an identification tag that can be attached to a paper document produced by the paper document output device. The paper document output device may dispense the identification tag when the paper document output device generates the paper document. For example the paper document output device may output a label with an identification tag affixed on it and request a user of the paper document output device to attach the dispensed label to the paper document generated by the paper document output device.

In addition to physically associating an identification tag with a paper document for each identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by a paper document output device the paper document output device may also be configured to read information stored on the identification tag. For example the paper document output device may be configured to read the identification code information from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by the paper document output device. The paper document output device may then store the identification code information read from the paper document.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the identification code information read from an identification tag physically associated with a paper document is used to uniquely identify the paper document and may be stored by paper document output device. For example the identification code information may be stored in a database paper document tracking database accessible to the paper document output device.

According to an embodiment of the present invention along with the identification codes information identifying physical locations of paper documents corresponding to the identification codes is also stored. For example for each identification code stored information identifying the physical location of the paper document identified by the identification code is also stored. The physical location information for a document identified by an identification code is associated with the identification code information for the document. The information is stored in a manner such that the physical location information for a particular document can be determined based upon the identification code for the particular document. According to an embodiment of the present invention the identification code and the physical locations information are stored in the paper document tracking database.

When a paper document output device generates a paper document the physical location of the paper document is the same as the physical location of the paper document output device itself. For example when a copier generates a photocopy the photocopy is generally located on an output tray of the copier. As a result when a paper document is generated by a paper document output device the identification code read from the identification tag physically associated with the paper document is stored and the physical location information associated with the stored identification code is initialized to the physical location of the paper document output device. As indicated above according to an embodiment of the present invention the paper document output device may store the identification code information and the physical location information in the paper document tracking database.

For each identification code stored in the paper document tracking database other information related to the paper document identified by the identification code may also be stored in the paper document tracking database. According to an embodiment of the present invention electronic information representative of the paper document may also be stored in the paper document tracking database and associated with the identification code identifying the paper document. For example a scanned image of the paper document an electronic format e.g. Postscript format PDF format image format etc. that is received by the paper document output device and used to generate the paper document etc. may be stored in the paper document tracking database.

For example for a paper document generated by a printer the printer may be configured to store the following information in the paper document tracking database the identification code information read from an identification tag physically associated with the paper document printed by the printer information identifying the physical location of the printer and electronic format e.g. Postscript file PDF file image format etc. received and used by the printer to generate the printout.

According to the teachings of the present invention the physical location information corresponding to an identification code and stored in the paper document tracking database is updated as the physical location of the paper document identified by the identification code changes. As described below a network of tag readers is used to determine the physical location of the paper document and to appropriately update the physical location information associated with the identification code identifying the document.

As indicated above the identification code information and the physical location information for paper documents may be stored in a paper document tracking database. The paper document output device or some other data processing system may store the paper document tracking database. If the information is stored by a system other than the paper document output device the paper document output device may be configured to forward the information to the other system.

Other information related to the photocopy may also be stored in the paper document tracking database.

According to an embodiment of the present invention selection of the Copy Start key represents a single user command that is interpreted by copier to request both copying physically associating an identification tag with the generated photocopy and storing information in the paper document tracking database. In this embodiment the user may not be aware that an identification tag has been applied to the photocopy produced by copier and that the identification code read from the identification tag and corresponding physical location information of the generated photocopy has been automatically archived by copier in the paper document tracking database.

User interface subsystem also serves as an interface for outputting information to the user. For example information related to the status of copier or information related to the copying function initiated by a user might be output to the user via interface .

Network interface subsystem provides an interface to other computer systems e.g. data processing system networks and devices. Embodiments of network interface subsystem include an Ethernet card a modem telephone satellite cable ISDN etc. asynchronous digital subscriber line DSL units and the like. Network interface system facilitates transfer of information to and from copier in an appropriate format.

For example according to an embodiment of the present invention software modules and control programs implementing the functionality of copier may be stored in storage subsystem . Processor may execute these software modules. Storage subsystem may also provide a repository or database for storing information according to the teachings of the present invention. For example the paper document tracking database may be stored in storage subsystem . It should be understood that the paper document tracking database may be stored locally i.e. by copier or by some other storage system. For example according to an embodiment of the present invention the paper document tracking database may be stored by data processing system . In this embodiment copier may be configured to communicate the identification code information and physical location information to data processing system .

Scanner subsystem includes a scanner and an image processing unit . Scanner is configured to capture an image of user provided document and transmit the image to image processing unit . Image processing unit operates to remove distortion inherent in the scanning process. The output of the image processing unit is a scanned image of document with the distortion removed. The scanned image is then forwarded to print subsystem for further processing via video bus . The scanned image is used to generate a photocopy of user provided document . According to an embodiment of the present invention the scanned image is also stored in the paper document tracking database and associated with identification code read from the identification tag physically associated with document .

According to an embodiment of the present invention an image data tap provides processor with access to scanned image data transferred over video bus . In alternative embodiments of the present invention the image scanned by scanner may be provided to processor by scanner subsystem .

Print subsystem operates in accordance with well known laser xerography principles and is configured to receive scanned information from scanner subsystem and produce a paper document photocopy of user provided document . Print engine operates in synchrony with tag subsystem to ensure that an identification tag is appropriately physically associated with photocopy and that identification code information from the identification tag is read and stored in the paper document tracking database along with physical location information for the photocopy.

Tag subsystem is configured to physically associate identification tags with photocopies generated by copier . As described above various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a photocopy paper document. For example the paper document photocopy may be generated using at least one tagged paper. An identification tag may also be attached to photocopy or embodied in an object attached to photocopy .

According to an embodiment of the present invention Hitachi Mu chips are used as an identification tag. Due to its reduced size various different ways may be used for physically associating a Mu chip with photocopy . If the chip is embedded in paper i.e. if tagged paper is used tag subsystem may select at least one tagged paper sheet and provide the tagged paper to print subsystem to generate photocopy paper document . According to an embodiment of the present invention tag subsystem in conjunction with print subsystem ensures that at least one tagged page is used to generate photocopy . If the photocopy consists of multiple pages then normal paper pages i.e. paper pages without the embedded identification tag may be used for other pages of the photocopy paper document. The selection of one or more tagged papers for generating photocopy may be performed by tag subsystem by print subsystem or by the two in conjunction.

An identification tag may also be physically associated with a paper document by physically applying or attaching the identification tag to the paper document. If the size of the identification tag permits the identification tag may be attached to paper document photocopy such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of paper document . For example the identification tag may be embedded or mounted on a staple and copier may attach the staple to photocopy document . The identification tag may also be attached to photocopy paper document by mixing it in the ink that is printed on one or more pages of the photocopy when the photocopy is generated by print subsystem . The identification tag may also be physically associated with the photocopy paper document generated by copier using an adhesive a clip or other like mechanism.

For example copier may dispense a label comprising an identification tag and a user may be requested to apply the dispensed label to photocopy generated by copier . Various other techniques may also be used to physically associate an identification tag with paper document .

As previously described each identification tag stores information such as a unique identification code that can be used to uniquely identify a paper document. The identification code may be programmed into the identification tag when the identification tag is manufactured or activated. In alternative embodiments of the present invention copier may be configured to write a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag during the generation of photocopy .

According to an embodiment of the present invention tag subsystem is also configured to read the identification code from an identification tag that is physically associated with a photocopy paper document generated by copier . In order to facilitate reading of the identification code from the identification tag one or more tag readers may be incorporated into tag subsystem . The tag readers are configured to read information from each identification tag physically associated with paper documents generated by copier . The type of tag reader used generally depends on the type of identification tags used by copier . For example if a Hitachi Mu chip is used as an identification tag tag reader included in tag subsystem may be constructed to expose the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band of microwaves and to detect and read radio waves emanating from the Mu chip. Various other types of tag readers that are capable of detecting electromagnetic optical acoustical or other signals may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention using other forms of identification tags.

Upon reading identification code information from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by copier the identification code information and the corresponding physical location information of the paper document is stored. Since the physical location of copy when it is generated is the same as the physical location of copier the physical location information is initialized to the physical location of copier . As indicated above the identification code read from the identification tag physically associated with the generated photocopy and the physical location information for the corresponding paper document may be stored in a paper document tracking database.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention other information related to the paper document might also be stored in the paper document tracking database along with the identification code information and the physical location information. For example according to an embodiment of the present invention the scanned image of document scanned by scanner subsystem is also stored in the paper document tracking database and associated with the identification code information read from the identification tag that is physically associated with photocopy generated by copier for user provided document . Other types of information related to the photocopy document might also be stored in the paper document tracking database.

Careful synchronization between the various subsystems of copier is needed to ensure proper functioning of copier according to the teachings of the present invention. Various synchronization signals known to those skilled in the art may be used to achieve this synchronization. Many other configurations of copier are possible having more or fewer components than the system depicted in .

As described above for each photocopy document generated by copier an identification tag storing a unique identification code is physically associated with the photocopy document. Identification code information that is read from the identification tag physically associated with the photocopy and information identifying the physical location of the generated photocopy is stored in the paper document tracking database. In the manner described above other paper document output devices may also be configured to generate paper documents according to the teachings of the present invention.

As depicted in a paper document output device generates a paper document and an identification tag is physically associated with the generated paper document step . As described above according to an embodiment of the present invention the identification tag may be automatically e.g. by using tagged paper a staple with the identification tag embedded in it ink containing the identification tag etc. physically associated with the paper document. In alternative embodiments the paper document output device may dispense an identification tag e.g. a label comprising an identification tag and request a user to physically associate the dispensed identification tag with the paper document generated by the paper document output device.

The identification code stored by the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document generated in step is read by the paper document output device step . As previously described various different techniques may be used to read identification code information stored by the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document generated in step . The type of technique used for reading information stored by the identification tag generally depends on the type of identification tag used by the paper document output device. The identification code read in step is used to uniquely identify the paper document generated in step .

It should be understood that in alternative embodiments of the present invention the identification code may be read from the identification tag before the identification tag is physically associated with the paper document. In these embodiments the paper document output device may identify an identification tag to be physically associated with the paper document read the identification code from the identified identification tag and then physically associate the identification tag with the paper document.

The identification code read from the identification tag in step is then stored in a paper document tracking database step . The physical location information for the paper document generated in step is also stored in the paper document tracking database step . The physical location information is stored such that it is associated with the identification code information stored in the paper document tracking database in step . At the time when the paper document is generated by the paper document output device the physical location of the paper document is the same as the physical location of the paper document output device. Accordingly in step the physical location information is initialized to the physical location of the paper document output device.

In specific embodiments of the present invention other information related to the paper document may also be stored in the paper document tracking database step . For example electronic information representative of a paper document e.g. electronic information that is used to generate the paper document may also be stored in the paper document tracking database along with the identification code identifying the paper document. For example a scanned image of the paper document an electronic format e.g. Postscript format PDF format that is received by the paper document output device and used to generate the paper document etc. may be stored in the paper document tracking database.

According to the teachings of the present invention the identification tags associated with the paper documents along with the information stored by the identification tags is used to determine physical locations of paper documents. is a simplified block diagram of a distributed system that may be used to track physical locations of paper documents according to an embodiment of the present invention. The configuration depicted in is merely illustrative of an environment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in system comprises a plurality of tag readers TRs and a user system coupled to a data processing system via communication links . Communication links depicted in may be of various types including hardwire links optical links satellite or other wireless communication links wave propagation links or any other mechanisms for communication of information. Various communication protocols may be used to facilitate communication of information via the communication links. These communication protocols may include TCP IP HTTP protocols extensible markup language XML wireless application protocol WAP protocols under development by industry standard organizations vendor specific protocols customized protocols and others.

Tag readers are configured to facilitate determination of physical locations of one or more paper documents that have identification tags physically associated either embedded or attached with them by reading identification code information stored by the identification tags. Whether or not a particular tag reader can read identification code from an identification tag physically associated with a paper document depends on the proximity of the particular tag reader to the identification tag. Since the identification tag is physically associated with a paper document whether or not a tag reader can read identification code from an identification tag depends on the proximity of the tag reader to the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated.

If an identification tag has an on board power supply e.g. an on board battery and is capable of communicating information including identification code information stored in the memory of the identification tag then a tag reader can detect and read the identification code from the identification tag if the tag reader can detect the information which could be in various formats communicated by the identification tag i.e. the distance from the identification tag to the tag reader is within the communication range of the identification tag and reception range of the tag reader .

If an identification tag does not have its own power supply and depends on a stimulus supplied by an external entity such as a tag reader then a tag reader is able to read identification code information from the identification tag if the tag reader can expose the identification tag to the requisite stimulus and can read the information transmitted or radiated by the identification tag in response to the stimulus. For example if a Hitachi Mu chip is used as an identification tag a tag reader can read the identification code from the Mu chip if the tag reader is able to expose the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves and is able to read the radio waves that emanate from the irradiated Mu chip identification tag.

The manner in which a tag reader reads the identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag used. Likewise a tag reader s ability to detect and read identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag and the proximity of the identification tag to the tag reader. It should be understood that the identification code from a particular identification tag physically associated with a paper document may be detected and read by multiple tag readers that are proximal to the paper document.

For example in the embodiment depicted in tag reader is able to read the identification code and other information from an identification tag physically associated with paper document PD . Tag readers and can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag reader is also able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag readers and can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document .

If a particular tag reader is able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located proximal to the particular tag reader. Accordingly the physical location of the paper document can be determined from the physical location of the tag reader that is able to read the identification code. If multiple tag readers are able to read an identification code from an identification tag associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located in a location or zone proximal to the multiple tag readers.

Various different techniques may be used to read information from identification tags using tag readers . According to an embodiment of the present invention a tag reader may be configured to periodically send out a signal to interrogate and read identification code from identification tags that the tag reader can detect and read. In other embodiments a tag reader may be configured to interrogate identification tags in response to a signal received from an external system device or application or in response to external stimuli. For example a tag reader may interrogate identification tags upon receiving a signal from data processing system .

For each identification code information read by a tag reader the tag reader may associate a timestamp with the identification code information indicating when e.g. date and time the tag reader read the identification code information. In addition to the identification code information a tag reader may also be configured to read other information stored in an identification tag interrogated by the tag reader. The information read by a tag reader from an identification tag may be stored by the tag reader or may be forwarded by the tag reader to a central database or computer system e.g. data processing system that may store and or process the information.

According to an embodiment of the present invention information read by tag readers is communicated to data processing system . Based upon the identification codes received from the individual tag readers and based upon the physical locations of the tag readers data processing system is able to determine the physical locations of paper documents corresponding to the identification codes received from the tag readers.

As described above if a particular tag reader is able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with a particular paper document it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located proximal to the particular tag reader. The physical location of the paper document can be then determined based on the physical location of the tag reader. is a simplified high level flowchart depicting a method of determining the physical location of a paper document corresponding to an identification code read by a tag reader according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method may be performed by data processing system . For example the method may be performed by software modules executed by processor s of data processing system or by hardware modules of data processing system or combinations thereof Flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the processing depicted in is performed for every identification code read by tag readers . The method is initiated when data processing system receives an identification code from one or more tag readers step . As described above data processing system may periodically receive information regarding identification codes read by tag readers . In alternative embodiments data processing system may receive the information in response to a signal communicated by data processing system to tag readers .

Data processing system then determines the one or more tag readers that were able to read the identification code received in step step . As previously described the identification code may be read by one or more tag readers. For example as depicted in an identification code read from an identification tag physically associated with document is read by tag readers and whereas an identification code read from an identification tag physically associated with document is only read by tag reader .

Data processing system then determines the physical location of each tag reader identified in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system stores or has access to information that identifies the various tag readers in distributed system and the physical locations of the tag readers. For example the information may indicate that tag reader is located in John s office tag reader is located in John s briefcase tag readers and are located in the conference room tag reader is located on Mr. Smith s office desk tag reader is located in Mr. Smith s in box container in his office and so on. According to an embodiment of the present invention information identifying the physical locations of the tag readers is stored in a memory location e.g. a file accessible to data processing system .

In alternative embodiments each tag reader may be configured to provide information to data processing system identifying the tag reader s physical location. A tag reader may communicate its physical location information to data processing system along with information related to identification codes read by the tag reader.

Data processing system then determines if the physical location information stored in the paper document tracking database and associated with the identification code received in step is different from the physical location information determined in step step . If the physical location information associated with the identification code and stored in the paper document tracking database is different from the information determined in step it indicates that the physical location of the paper document corresponding to the identification code has changed since the last time that information related to the identification code was stored in the paper document tracking database. In this case data processing system updates the physical location information associated with the identification code in the paper document tracking database to reflect the information determined in step step . A timestamp value corresponding to when the one or more tag readers read the identification code determined in step might also be stored in the paper document tracking database.

If the physical location information for the identification code in the paper document tracking database is the same as the information determined in step it indicates that the physical location of the paper document corresponding to the identification code has not changed since the last time that information related to the identification code was stored in the paper document tracking database. In this case the physical location stored in the paper document tracking database corresponding to the identification code need not be changed. A timestamp value corresponding to when the one or more tag readers read the identification code determined in step might be stored in the paper document tracking database.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention if it is determined in step that the physical location of the document has changed instead of overwriting the previous physical location information associated with the identification code identifying the document per step information identifying the new physical location of the document determined in step may be appended to the physical location information associated with the identification code information. In this embodiment for each identification code the physical location information associated with an identification code comprises information identifying the various physical locations of the paper document over time. The physical tracking information associated with the identification code thus represents a log of the various physical locations where the paper document was detected. Each physical location entry in the log may be time stamped indicating when the document was detected to be in that location.

In the manner described above the information stored in the paper document tracking database is continuously updated to reflect the latest physical location of a paper document that has an identification tag physically associated with it. A user may then query the paper document tracking database to determine the physical location of any specific paper document identified by an identification code. A user may also query the paper document tracking database to determine a log of the various physical locations where the paper document has been located.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a user may use user system depicted in to query information stored in the paper document tracking database. A user interface may be provided on user system that enables the user to configure a query to determine physical locations of one or more user specified documents and to output results of the query. The documents may be specified using identification codes associated with the documents or using other techniques. User system may be a personal computer a portable computer a workstation a computer terminal a network computer a kiosk a personal digital assistant PDA a communication device such as a cell phone or any other data processing system.

As described above according to an embodiment of the present invention data processing system determines electronic document information for a paper document based upon information received from paper document processing device . is a simplified high level flowchart depicting a method performed by data processing system for determining electronic document information according to an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart depicted in assumes that a paper document processing device is coupled to a data processing system similar to the embodiment shown in . However it should be understood that the general processing depicted in may also be applied to other embodiments of the present invention. For example for the embodiment of the present invention depicted in the processing depicted in is performed by paper document processing device . Accordingly flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives. The processing depicted in may be performed by software modules executed by a processor of data processing system by hardware modules of data processing system or a combination thereof

As depicted in processing is initiated when data processing system receives a signal from a paper document processing device step . The signal may comprise information identifying an identification code corresponding to an identification tag and electronic representation of a paper document. Other types of information such as the physical location of a paper document may also be included in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

Data processing system then extracts a feature descriptor from the electronic representation received in step step . A feature descriptor extracted from an electronic representation of a paper document represents information extracted from the electronic representation e.g. a scanned image . The feature descriptor can be used to uniquely identify the document. The extracted feature descriptor can be matched to other feature descriptors if the feature descriptors are consistently extracted from a similarly located section of the electronic representation. For example a small rectangular patch from the upper left hand corner of the first page of a document may be selected for extracting a feature descriptor. One technique used by data processing system for extracting a feature descriptor from an electronic representation is described below. Various other feature extraction techniques known to those skilled in the art may also be used by data processing system . For example the various feature extraction techniques described in U.S. Pat.

Data processing system then searches the one or more document information databases to identify one or more feature descriptors that match the feature descriptor extracted in step step . If the feature descriptor extracted in step and the feature descriptors stored in document information databases are extracted from a consistent location of an electronic representation e.g. a scanned image of a paper document then if two feature descriptors match it implies that there is a high likelihood that the scanned images from which the feature descriptors were extracted also match.

For each feature descriptor electronic document information corresponding to the feature descriptor is also stored. The electronic document information may comprise information identifying an electronic document information specifying a storage location for the electronic document represented by the feature descriptor or a pointer or reference to the electronic document. For example electronic document information for a particular feature descriptor may identify a file corresponding to the particular feature descriptor and a directory location where the file is stored a uniform resource identifier or locator URI or URL pointing to an electronic document represented by the particular feature descriptor and other like information. The information in a document information database may be indexed by the feature descriptors information.

Data processing system then determines from document information databases electronic document information corresponding to each matching feature descriptor determined in step step . Data processing system may then store the electronic document information determined in step along with the identification code received in step in paper document tracking database step . The electronic document information is associated with the identification code and stored in a manner such that the electronic document information for a particular identification code can be determined given the identification code.

Other information received by data processing system from paper document processing device in step for the particular identification code may also be stored such that the other information can be retrieved given the identification code information. For example as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 235 035 information identifying physical location of a paper document corresponding to the identification code may also be stored in paper document tracking database . The information stored in paper document tracking database may be indexed by the identification code information. As depicted in paper document tracking database may be implemented as a table wherein each row of the table stores information related to a particular identification code. As shown in each row stores information identifying an identification code electronic document information determined by data processing system for a paper document corresponding to the identification code physical location information for the paper document identified by the identification code and other information related to the paper document corresponding to the identification code.

The electronic document information determined in step or a portion thereof may then be communicated to the paper document processing device that was the source of the signal received in step step . As described above paper document processing device may then store the information in an identification tag.

As depicted in a portion of the electronic representation is selected step . The selected portion may represent for example a section of the electronic representation corresponding to a particular page of a document.

Zones of text pictures graphics photographs etc. are then located on the portion selected in step step . The coordinates e.g. X coordinates and Y coordinates and extent of each zone may be calculated in step .

A feature extraction technique is then applied to at least one zone or a subset of a zone determined in step to determine a feature descriptor for the electronic representation step . To enable matching of the feature descriptor extracted for the electronic representation and feature descriptors stored in document information databases the location of the one or more zones used for feature extraction are the same as those selected for extracting feature descriptors stored in document information databases .

Several different feature extraction techniques known to those skilled in the art may be applied. According to one technique optical character recognition OCR may be applied to one or more zones and the results of the OCR analysis represent the feature descriptor for the electronic representation of the paper document. Various other techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

The feature descriptor extracted in step may then be used to search one or more document information databases as indicated in step of flowchart in . According to an embodiment of the present invention a search query may be constructed using the extracted feature descriptor. The search query may then be used to search the document information databases to locate matching feature descriptors per step of flowchart depicted in .

As described above according to an embodiment of the present invention electronic document information for a paper document is located and stored along with the identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. For example the information may be stored in a paper document tracking database . According to an embodiment of the present invention the electronic document information may also be stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. The information stored in paper document tracking database and or the information stored in the identification tag may be used in various applications for various purposes.

According to one application the stored information for a paper document may be used to generate a perfect copy of the paper document. A well known inherent problem with photocopying a document is that the quality of the photocopy degrades as successive copies are made. For example if the original paper document is referred to as the 0th generation all copies are first generation at best. Degradation of copy quality is inevitable as copies are made from successive i.e. first second third etc. generation copies wherein the cumulative degradation can ultimately result in an unrecognizable document. The present invention resolves this problem and can be used to generate photocopies that are as good as the original paper document i.e. a perfect photocopy.

Various techniques may be used to generate a perfect photocopy of a paper document that has an identification tag physically associated with it. As described above according to an embodiment of the present invention the identification tag stores electronic document information for the paper document which specifies an electronic document corresponding to the paper document and the storage location of the electronic document. When a photocopy of the paper document is to be generated the copier may be configured to read the electronic document information for the paper document from the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document access the electronic document corresponding to the paper document and use the electronic document to generate the photocopy. In this manner the copier is able to generate a 0th generation photocopy on a continuous basis.

If the electronic document information is not stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document the copier may be configured to read the identification code from the identification tag use the identification code to locate a record e.g. a row in a table in paper document tracking database find electronic document information for the paper document corresponding to the identification code from the paper document tracking database and then use the electronic document information to generate the photocopy. In this manner the copier is able to generate a 0th generation photocopy for the paper document.

Various other operations besides photocopying may also be performed on an electronic document corresponding to a paper document using the paper document. For example a facsimile machine may be configured to read information stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document use the information to locate an electronic document corresponding to the paper document and use the electronic document to communicate information via facsimile. A printer may be configured to read information stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document use the information to locate an electronic document corresponding to the paper document and generate a printout based upon the electronic document. Various other operations that can be performed on electronic documents are also envisioned within the scope of the present invention.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the physical location of a paper document that has an identification tag physically associated with it can be tracked. Please refer to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 235 035 for further details.

Certain embodiments of the present invention provide a container that is capable of outputting information related to objects stored in the container. The container is able to output information for objects that are stored by the container and that have identification tags physically associated with them.

For purposes of this application the term container is intended to refer to any area receptacle or holder capable of containing holding or storing one or more objects. Examples of a container include a box a briefcase a bag a case a basket a cabinet a cupboard portable containers a shelf a desk and the like. Examples of objects that can be stored in a container include paper documents books magazines pens cups and other physical objects.

As indicated above for objects that are stored or contained in a container and have identification tags physically associated with them the container is capable of outputting information related to the objects. According to an embodiment of the present invention each identification tag that is physically associated with an object stores information related to the object. The information may include information that can be used to uniquely identify the object with which the identification tag is physically associated. For example an identification tag may store an identification code that may be used to uniquely identify the object with which the identification tag is physically associated. It should be understood that other types of information that can be used to identify objects may also be stored in an identification tag in alternative embodiments of the present invention.

In addition to identification code information other types of information related to an object may also be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with the object. For example if the object is a paper document information that may be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document may include an electronic representation of the contents of the paper document e.g. a scanned image of the paper document a Postscript format file or Portable Document Format PDF or image format or other file format etc. information identifying the author of the paper document the date when the paper document was created the number of pages in the paper document and other like information. Other information that can be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10 235 035 10 235 042 10 235 028 10 235 030 and 10 234 414 the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

According to the teachings of the present invention a container may output information read from identification tags that are physically associated with one or more objects stored by the container. For example the container may output identification code information read from the identification tags. For example if the object is a paper document and the information read from an identification tag physically associated with the paper document includes an electronic representation e.g. a scanned image of the paper document then the container may be configured to output the electronic representation.

Alternatively the container may use the information read from the identification tags to determine additional information related to the objects stored by the container and output the additional information. For example a container may use the identification code information read from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document to determine information identifying a storage location e.g. a directory and filename for an electronic representation of the paper document. The container may then output the storage location information.

In certain embodiments a container may be configured to communicate the information read from identification tags physically associated with objects in the container to a data processing system. The data processing system may then output the information received from the container. The data processing system may also determine additional information based on the information received from a container and output the additional information. Depending upon the type of identification tag used the information may be stored in the memory of the identification tag when the tag is manufactured when the tag is activated or at some later time using software or hardware techniques. For example a paper document output device e.g. a printer copier scanner facsimile machine etc. may be configured to store a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by paper document output device. Other information related to the paper document may also be stored in the identification tag by the paper document output device.

Various devices known to those skilled in the art may be used as identification tags. According to an embodiment of the present invention each identification tag device includes an on device memory that is capable of storing information. According to an embodiment of the present invention radio frequency identification devices RFIDs are used as identification tags. For example the Mu chip manufactured by Hitachi Ltd. may be used as an identification tag. The Mu chip is a radio recognition IC chip that measures 0.4 mm square and is 60 microns thick in its present embodiment. The Mu chip comprises an on chip memory presently a 128 bit ROM that can be programmed to store information.

Various different techniques including manual and automated techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with an object. The identification tag may be permanently or temporarily attached to an object. Depending on the size of the identification tag the identification tag may be embedded in the object. For example due to its reduced size a Mu chip can be embedded in an object. For example for a paper document object a Mu chip identification tag may be embedded in a paper page of the paper document. A paper page that has an identification tag embedded in it may be referred to as tagged paper . Similarly an identification tag may be embedded in other objects.

An identification tag may also be physically associated with an object by physically applying or attaching the identification tag to the object. For example the tag may be attached to the object using clips staples adhesives ties strings rubber bands etc. The identification tag may also be incorporated into another object such as a staple a clip a label etc. that is then attached to the object.

An identification tag may be physically associated with an object such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of the object. For example as described above an identification tag may be embedded in the object e.g. a paper document comprising a tagged paper . If the object is a paper document an identification tag may be mixed in the ink that is printed on the paper document.

Bus subsystem provides a mechanism for letting the various components and subsystems of container communicate with each other as intended. Although bus subsystem is shown schematically as a single bus alternative embodiments of the bus subsystem may utilize multiple buses.

The tag readers are appropriately positioned in container such that they can detect and read or obtain information stored by identification tags physically associated with objects contained in container .

The type of tag readers used and the technique used by the tag readers to read the information stored on an identification tag depends on the type of identification tag used. According to an embodiment of the present invention a tag reader may read information from an identification tag by scanning the identification tag. In other embodiments a tag reader may read the information by receiving the information from the identification tag. A tag reader may receive the information from an identification tag in response to an external stimulus e.g. electromagnetic energy or signal provided to the identification tag. The external stimulus or signal may be provided by the tag reader or by some other device or application. If the identification tag is self powered the identification tag may be configured to communicate the information stored by the identification tag to the tag reader. A tag reader may read the information stored by a tag reader in various forms including electromagnetic waves electronic signals acoustic signals etc.

For example in its present embodiment information stored by a Hitachi Mu chip can be read by exposing the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves. The Mu chip uses the microwave energy as a power source and communicates the information stored in the on chip memory in the form of radio waves that can be detected and read by a tag reader. In alternative embodiments the Mu chip may also include an on chip antenna to increase the communication distance range. In yet other embodiments a power source may be provided on the Mu chip and the Mu chip may be programmed to communicate the information stored by the Mu chip to a tag reader. Accordingly if a Hitachi Mu chip is used as an identification tag tag readers included in tag subsystem may be constructed to expose the Mu chip to 2.45 GHz band of microwaves and to detect and read radio waves emanating from the Mu chip. Various other types of tag readers that are capable of detecting electromagnetic optical acoustical or other signals may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention using other forms of identification tags.

Processor is configured to execute software modules that control and coordinate functioning of the various subsystems of container . Processor is also configured to execute software code modules and control programs that control operation of container in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.

According to the teachings of the present invention container is configured to output information related to objects stored or contained in container . is a simplified high level flowchart depicting a method of outputting information related to objects stored or contained in container according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method depicted in may be performed by software modules executed by processor s of container by hardware modules coupled to container or combinations thereof. Flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in the method is initiated when container receives a signal to output information related to objects stored by container step . The signal may be received from a variety of different sources. According to an embodiment of the present invention the signal may be received from input interface of the container. For example input interface may provide an input device e.g. a button that a user may select e.g. user may activate or press a button to generate a signal causing container to output information related to objects stored by container . The signal may also be received from devices computer systems or other containers remotely situated from container and that may be coupled to container via communication link . Container may receive the signal from these remote devices via communication link .

The signal in step may also be received from applications or programs executed by container . For example container may execute a timer application that is configured to generate the signal at periodic time intervals. The signal received in step may also be generated when a software program executing on container detects the occurrence of a particular event. For example container may be configured to execute a calendar program or a scheduling software program. These programs may be configured to generate the signal upon the occurrence of a particular date at a particular time upon the occurrence of a user configurable event etc.

Information from identification tags physically associated with objects stored in container is then read using the tag readers included in tag reader subsystem step . The information read from each identification tag physically associated with an object may include identification code information and other information related to the object. The other information related to the object may include information descriptive of the object. For example the other information may include information identifying the object information describing characteristics of the object such as the color of the object the manufacturer of the object the user of the object and other like information.

For example if the object is a paper document the information stored in an identification tag physically associated with the paper document may comprise a representation of the contents of the particular paper document e.g. scanned images of the paper document electronic document corresponding to the paper document information identifying the paper document e.g. title of the paper document etc. information identifying an electronic representation of the paper document e.g. a filename directory location etc. information identifying another document related to the paper document and the like. It should be understood that based upon the type of an object various different kinds of information may be stored in the identification tag physically associated with the object and read by tag subsystem in step .

Container then determines the information related to the one or more objects contained in container that is to be output step . According to an embodiment of the present invention for an object contained in container the object related information to be output includes information read from an identification tag physically associated with the object in step or a portion thereof. For example if the information read from the identification tag includes an identification code the identification code may be selected to be output.

In alternative embodiments the information read in step from an identification tag physically associated with an object contained in container may be used to find additional information related to the object. For example according to an embodiment of the present invention if the information read in step from an identification tag physically associated with an object contained in container includes a unique identification code associated with object the identification code may be used to determine additional information related to the object.

The additional information may be determined from a plurality of sources including databases tables data structures etc. As described in the applications that have been incorporated by reference for paper document objects information identifying a plurality of identification codes identifying paper documents and information associated with the plurality of identification codes may be stored in a paper document tracking database. The information associated with each identification code in the paper document tracking database may include information indicating a storage location of an electronic representation of the paper document information identifying a physical location of the paper document information identifying actions that have been performed on the paper document electronic representation of the paper document information identifying attributes e.g. author number of pages etc title etc. of the paper document and other information. Likewise other databases may store information associated with identification codes identifying other types of objects.

Container may use information stored in databases such as the paper document tracking database to determine additional information related to the objects. Based upon the identification code read from an identification tag physically associated with an object in step container may determine the information corresponding to the identification code from the databases. The additional information determined by container or a portion thereof may be included in the object related information that is selected in step to be output by container .

The databases e.g. paper document tracking database storing additional information related to the objects may be stored by container e.g. in storage subsystem . Alternatively container may access information stored in these databases via communication link .

Container then outputs the information determined in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention the information is output via output interface . For example the information may be output via a flat screen on the container.

In alternative embodiments container may communicate the information determined in step to an external device system or to another container via communication link . The external device system or the other container may then output the information.

In alternative embodiments after reading the information from identification tags in step container may be configured to communicate the information to a data processing system using communication subsystem . The data processing system may then determine the information to be output to the user i.e. step may be performed by the data processing system . The data processing system may then output the information per step . In these embodiments the data processing system may determine additional information related to the objects based upon the information received from a container. The additional information or portions thereof may be output to the user.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the information output by container may enable a user of container to find out information related to objects stored in container in a convenient and simple manner. The information enables a user of the present invention to determine identity of objects stored in the container. For example as described above according to an embodiment of the present invention a user may press a button provided by input interface of container and in response descriptive information related to objects stored by the container is output to the user via output interface .

A user located at a remote location may also receive information related to the contents of container .

Flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in processing is initiated when container receives a search query that includes information specifying search criteria step . The search query may be received from various different sources. According to an embodiment of the present invention a user of container may configure the search query using input interface . The search query may also be received from devices computer systems or other containers remotely situated from container and coupled to container via communication link . The search query may also be received from applications or programs executed by container .

Search criteria of different types may be specified in a search query. According to an embodiment of the present invention the search criteria identifies an object and the search query requests container to determine if the specified object is stored in container . For example the search query may request container to determine if container contains a calculator . The search criteria may also specify one or more characteristics of an object and the search query may request container to determine if container contains one or more objects satisfying the specified characteristics. For example the search query may request container to determine if container contains a paper document entitled Company Re organization Plan .

Information from identification tags physically associated with objects stored in container is then read using tag reader subsystem step . As described above the information read from each identification tag physically associated with an object contained in container may include identification code information and other information related to the object.

Based upon the information read in step container then determines if one or more objects stored in container satisfy the search criteria specified in the search query received in step step . According to an embodiment of the present invention the information read in step is used to determine if the search criteria is satisfied by one or more objects stored by the container. In alternative embodiments the information read in step is used to determine additional information related to the objects. The additional information may be used to determine if one or more objects stored in container satisfy the search criteria specified in the search query received in step .

Container may employ various types of processing in step to determine if an object stored in container satisfies the search criteria. For example if the search query requests if a calculator is contained in container container may determine if the information read from the identification tags physically associated with objects in container or the additional information determined based on the identification codes information indicates that an object in the container is a calculator.

If the search query identifies a characteristic of an object e.g. the title of a paper document container may determine if the information read from the identification tags physically associated with objects in container or the additional information indicates if an object in container possesses the specified characteristic. For example if the search query specifies a title of a paper document and the information read from the identification tags physically associated with objects in container or the additional information determined by container includes one or more scanned images of paper documents then image processing techniques may be applied to the scanned images to determine if any of the scanned images has the specified title.

Results of the processing performed in step are then output to the user step . The information that is output may indicate whether or not the search criteria were satisfied. The information that is output may also identify the one or more objects that satisfied the search criteria. For example if the search query specifies a title of a paper document the information output in step may indicate if a paper document with the specified title is contained in container . Information related to the document with the specified title may also be output.

The information in step may be output via output interface of container . Alternatively container may communicate the information to a data processing system that was the origination point of the search query via communication link .

According to an embodiment of the present invention container may also be configured to track objects that are inserted or removed from container relative to a baseline list of objects. A user may provide information specifying the baseline list of objects to container . For example a user may provide information related to the baseline list of objects using input interface of container . The baseline list information may also be communicated to container via communication link .

Objects in the baseline list may be identified using various techniques. According to an embodiment of the present invention the objects may be identified using identification codes stored in identification tags that are physically associated with the objects. For example a list of identification codes identifying the baseline list of objects may be provided to container .

In alternative embodiments of the present invention container may be configured to automatically generate the baseline list of objects based upon objects stored by the container. is a simplified high level flowchart depicting a method of automatically generating a baseline list of objects stored by container according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method may be performed by software modules executed by processor of container by hardware modules coupled to container or combinations thereof. Flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in processing is initiated when container receives a signal to generate a baseline list of objects step . The signal may be received from a variety of different sources. According to an embodiment of the present invention the signal may be received from a user using input interface . For example input interface may provide an input device e.g. a button that a user may select e.g. user may activate or press a button instructing container to generate a baseline list of objects based upon objects contained in container . The signal in step may also be received from devices computer systems or other containers remotely situated from container and coupled to container via communication link . The signal may also be received from applications or programs executed by container .

In response to the signal tag readers included in tag reader subsystem of container are used to read or obtain identification code information from identification tags physically associated with objects contained in container step . According to an embodiment of the present invention each identification code read from an identification tag uniquely identifies the object with which the identification tag is physically associated. The list of one or more identification codes read in step thus represents a list of objects stored by container .

The list of identification codes is then stored as the baseline list of objects step . The baseline list information may be stored by container e.g. stored in storage subsystem of container or may be communicated by container to a remote system coupled to container via communication link . The remote system may then store the baseline list information.

The baseline list of objects is then used by container to determine if one or more objects have been added or have been removed or are missing from container . is a simplified high level flowchart depicting a method of determining if one or more objects have been added removed or are missing from container according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method may be performed by software modules executed by processor of container by hardware modules coupled to container or combinations thereof. Flowchart depicted in is merely illustrative of an embodiment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations modifications and alternatives.

As depicted in processing is initiated when container receives a signal to determine if one or more objects have been added or have been removed or are missing from container step . The signal may be received from a variety of different sources. According to an embodiment of the present invention the signal may be received from a user using input interface . For example input interface may provide an input device e.g. a button that a user may select e.g. user may activate or press a button to generate a signal instructing container to determine if one or more objects have been added or have been removed or are missing from container relative to the baseline list of objects. The signal in step may also be received from devices computer systems or other container remotely situated from container and coupled to container via communication link . The signal may also be received from applications or programs executed by container . For example an application executed by processor may generate the signal at periodic time intervals.

In response to the signal the tag readers that are included in tag reader subsystem are used to read identification code information from identification tags physically associated with objects contained in container step . The list of one or more identification codes read in step represents a list of objects presently stored by container .

The list of objects obtained in step is then compared with the baseline list of objects to determine if one or more objects have been added to container or are missing from container relative to the baseline list of objects step . If a particular identification code is included in the baseline list but is not included in the list of identification codes obtained in step it indicates that an object corresponding to the particular identification code has been removed or is missing from container relative to the baseline list of objects. If a particular identification code is not included in the baseline list but is included in the list obtained in step it indicates that an object corresponding to the particular identification code has been added to container relative to the baseline list of objects. If the identification codes read in step and the identification codes listed in the baseline list of objects are the same it indicates that no object has been added or removed from container .

The results of the comparison performed in step are then either stored or output to the user step . According to an embodiment of the present invention if it is determined in step that one or more objects have been added or removed or are missing from container relative to the baseline list of objects then identification codes corresponding to the added or removed objects may be output to the user. Other information related to or descriptive of the added or removed objects may also be output along with the identification codes information. The other object related information may be read from the identification tags or may be determined from object databases accessible to container .

As described above container can be configured to output information indicating whether one or more objects have been added and or are missing from a container relative to a baseline list of objects. For example if container is embodied as a briefcase the user of the briefcase may before leaving for work push a button on the briefcase that causes the briefcase to generate a baseline list of objects e.g. pens pencils paper documents PDAs etc. contained in the briefcase. Later before coming back home from work the user may push another button on the briefcase that causes the briefcase to automatically output information about objects that have been added or removed from the briefcase relative to the baseline list of objects. An alert may be output if an object is missing. In this manner the user can easily and conveniently determine if any objects are missing or have been added to the user s briefcase.

As another example if container is embodied as a toolbox a user of the toolbox may push a button on the toolbox that causes generation of a baseline list of objects e.g. tools etc. contained in the toolbox. The user may then push another button on the toolbox at some later time to automatically receive information about objects that have been added or removed from the toolbox relative to the baseline list of objects. In this manner the user can easily and conveniently determine if any objects are missing from the toolbox.

According to an embodiment of the present invention container maintains a running history log of object additions and or removals from container . In this embodiment container periodically reads identification code information from identification tags physically associated with objects contained in container and uses the information read at periodic time intervals to determine when objects were added or removed from container .

As depicted in tag readers included in tag reader subsystem are used to read identification code information from identification tags physically associated with objects contained in container at a present time step . A list of identification codes is then generated based upon the information read in step step . The list referred to as the present list of one or more identification codes represents a list of objects stored by container at the present time. A time stamp corresponding to the present time may be associated with the list generated in step .

The list of identification codes generated in step is then compared with a previously generated list of identification codes to determine if there are any differences between the present list and the previous list step . The previously generated list is a list generated at a previous time when the identification tags were scanned referred to as the previous list where previous time present time t for some user configurable t . If there is no difference between the identification codes listed in the previous list and identification codes listed in the present list it indicates that no object has been added and or removed from container in the time interval between when the previous list was generated the previous time and the time when the present list was generated the present time i.e. during the time interval from previous time to present time . In such a scenario processing continues with step .

If there is a difference between the identification codes listed in the previous list and identification codes listed in the present list it indicates that one or more objects have been added and or removed from container in the time interval between the present time and the previous time. The differences between the previous list and the present list are identified step . Accordingly in step container identifies identification codes that are included in the previous list but not in the present list and identification codes that are included in the present list but are not included in the previous list. If a particular identification code is included in the previous list but is not included in the present list it indicates that an object corresponding to the particular identification code has been removed from container in the time interval between when the previous list was generated and the time when the present list was generated. If a particular identification code is not included in the previous list but is included in the present list it indicates that an object corresponding to the particular identification code has been added to container in the time interval between when the previous list was generated and the time when the present list was generated.

Information related to the identification codes identified in step is then appended to a history log maintained by container step . For each identification code information indicating whether an object corresponding to the identification code was removed or added to container and the time interval i.e. the time interval between the present time and previous time when the addition or removal occurred is also stored in the history log.

After updating the history log according to step and after waiting for a pre configured time period step processing continues with step wherein the next periodic scan of the identification tags contained in container is performed. The method depicted in is then repeated. The time period t between successive reads of the identification tags may be user configurable.

In the manner described above container maintains a running history log of additions and removals of objects from container . Information from the history log or portions thereof can be output to the user. For example a user of container may specify a particular time period e.g. an hour a day a week etc. and information from the history log indicating additions and removals of objects from container for the user specified time period may be output to the user.

Information from the history log may also be used to augment the information output to the user in step of flowchart depicted in . For example for each object that has been added or removed from container relative to the baseline list of objects information indicating when the object was added or removed from container may also be output to the user based upon information stored in the history log.

In other embodiments container may be configured to output an alarm signal to the user whenever container senses than an object has been removed from container . The alarm signal may be output to the user via output interface . The alarm signal may comprise information identifying the object that is missing from container . In alternative embodiments container may be configured to output the alarm signal only when container senses that certain user specified objects have been removed from container .

According to an embodiment of the present invention information regarding additions and removals of objects from container may be written to the identification tags that are physically associated with the objects. For example every time that a scan of the objects in container is performed information may be stored in the identification tags of the objects in container indicating the time the scan was performed and information indicating that the object was sensed to be contained in container . In this manner a history of when the object was in container is stored on the object s identification tag. A user can then determine when an object was added or removed from container from information stored in the object s identification tag no network connection or retrieval from a central database is required.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention container may comprise an object motion sensing subsystem that can sense when an object is added or removed from container . By detecting motion of an object the object motion sensing subsystem can determine when an object is removed from container or added to container . When removal or addition of an object to container is sensed information may be stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with the object indicating the time and date when the addition or removal takes place and indicating whether the object was added or removed. For example an information such as the following may be stored in the identification tag that is physically associated with an object.

The addition removal information for an object detected by the object motion sensing subsystem may also be stored by container . In this manner a history of additions and removals of objects from container is maintained. This history information may be accessed and or queried by a user of container .

Container may also be equipped with a camera that is capable of capturing an image of a user who removes or adds an object to container . The camera may be configured to capture a photo of a user every time an object is added or removed from container . In this embodiment each entry in the addition removal history log may be augmented with information identifying a user responsible for removing or adding an object to container . The camera may be included in sensors of container .

Various other types of information related to objects contained in container may also be stored by container and or written to identification tags physically associated with the objects. For example security information as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10 235 030 may be stored.

The document monitoring device further includes an arrangement of sensors disposed about an area of the structure . As can be seen in the figure the sensors are arrayed in a regular pattern. It will be appreciated that the sensors can be arranged in any regular pattern other than the rectangular pattern shown. Moreover it will be appreciated that the sensors can be arranged in an irregular or otherwise random pattern.

A detection module receives an output signal that represents a collection of the signals produced by the sensors . The detection module produces a detection signal based on the output signal. The detection module can be an appropriately configured computer processor or an analog device depending on the nature of the output signal . As will be seen below in a particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention the output signal is digital and so the detection module can be a digital processing device.

A control signal A is coupled to the sensors to control their action. In one embodiment of the invention the control signal is produced by the detection module . This configuration might be appropriate for providing synchronous operation between the sensors and the detection module. Alternatively as can be seen in a control signal B can be provided from a source other than the detection module.

The components of a radio frequency identification system RFID are used in a particular implementation of this embodiment of the invention. RFID is a versatile wireless solution for identification. It has a wide range of applications from tracking books in a library to monitoring the movement of cattle on a ranch. show that a basic RFID system comprises three components an antenna component coil a transceiver component and a transponder commonly called an RFID tag .

The antenna component emits radio signals to activate the tag . Antennas are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Thus it can be appreciated that antennas can constitute the sensors shown in FIGS. and A C in this particular implementation of the invention.

Often the antenna component is packaged with a transceiver component which typically includes a decoder module. This combination is referred to variously as a reader an interrogator and so on. In operation the reader can emit radio waves interrogation signal in ranges of anywhere from one inch to several feet or more depending upon its power output and the radio frequency used. The transceiver component produces the interrogation signal which is then propagated by the antenna component.

When an RFID tag passes through the electromagnetic zone of the interrogation signal it responds to that signal and produces a response signal which is picked up by the antenna component and fed to the transceiver component . The decoder module in the transceiver decodes the response signal to extract the data encoded in the tag and the data is passed to a host computer for subsequent processing.

RFID tags come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some tags can only be read while other tags can be read and written. For example a product called the MU chip by Hitachi Ltd. is a 0.4 mmchip that is thin enough about 60 m to be embedded in paper and contains a read only memory ROM of 128 bits.

RFID tags are categorized as either active or passive. Active RFID tags are powered by an internal battery and are typically read write i.e. tag data can be rewritten and or modified. The battery supplied power of an active tag generally gives it a longer read range. The trade off of course is greater size greater cost and a limited operational life due to the limited life of the battery. Nonetheless it can be appreciated that active tags can be useful in the present invention under appropriate operational requirements.

Passive RFID tags operate without a separate external power source and obtain operating power generated from the interrogation signal transmitted from the reader. Passive tags are consequently much lighter than active tags less expensive and offer a virtually unlimited operational lifetime. The trade off is that they have shorter read ranges than active tags and require a higher powered reader. Read only tags are typically passive and are programmed with a unique set of data usually 32 to 128 bits that cannot be modified. For example the Hitachi MU chip comes preprogrammed with a 128 bit data word.

In accordance with the present invention physical documents have one or more RFID tags physically associated with them. A plethora of attachment processes are possible. An RFID tag can be attached by the use of adhesives. A clip which gathers together a multi page document can be provided with an RFID tag. For example a paper clip may incorporate a tag or a staple can be incorporated with a tag.

The attachment can be manual or by automation. For example a copying machine can be outfitted with RFID tagged staples or a dispenser of adhesive tags so that stapled copies can be tagged by way of the staple or single page copies can be tagged with an adhesive tag. RFID tags e.g. Hitachi MU chip can be embedded in the paper medium itself tagged paper .

In accordance with this particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention each RFID tag is associated with a unique identification referred to herein as a tag identifier. Furthermore when a tag is physically associated with a physical document there is an association between the tag identifier and document information relating to the physical document. The document information might comprise an electronic copy of the physical document an image of the document a reference which identifies the physical or an electronic form of document a reference identifying where an electronic copy of the physical document can be found references to other documents and so on. The document information might include information indicative of permissions for example whether a document can be copied or not. The document information might include ownership information document modification history information. In general one can appreciate that any kind of information may constitute document information. 

The document information can be collected at the time of creation of the document e.g. when the document is printed copied faxed or otherwise processed. The document information can be an accumulation of information collected during the lifetime of the document such as when modifications are made or when copies are made for example. A database system not shown can be provided to store such information or other suitable information management system. The database or information management system can be used to provide the mapping between tag identifier and document information.

In the particular embodiment shown in the sensors are interrogation circuits comprising a transceiver circuit to produce an interrogation signal . The response signal picked up by the antenna component of each sensor is detected by the transceiver circuit. However not all of the sensors will detect the response signal. Since the response signal is typically weak especially in the case of a passive RFID tag only those sensors within the transmission range of the response signal generated by the tag will be able to detect the signal.

The limited transmission range of an RFID tag is illustrated in . In all of the interrogators transmit an interrogation signal though for clarity only the signals and for two interrogators and respectively are shown . A document having an associated RFID tag is exposed to the electromagnetic radiation. shows the response signal produced by the tag . However since the signal strength of the response signal is low its range is limited and is therefore not detected by all of the interrogators. Rather in this case the response signal is detected only by the interrogator

Now consider a time t t when the document has been moved. This is indicated by the document in phantom shown in position . At a time t t a second interrogation signal is transmitted by the transceiver circuits of the sensors step another set of sensors will detect the response signal produced by the tag step . A second set of sensor output signals is produced as output signal and stored in the detection module step as second information indicative of the second position of the document. Movement of the document can then be determined step based on the first sensor output signals and the second sensor output signals.

In one particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention the detection module can process the sensor output signals by associating each signal with information indicating the location of the sensor. For example the sensor output signal received from the sensor might be associated with a location identified by the coordinate A 1 . Thus movement of the document is determined from the point of view of comparing the locations of those sensors which detected the tag s response signal at time twith the location of those sensors which detected the response signal at time t.

Alternatively the detection module can process the sensor output signals by associating the sensor output signals with the sensors themselves. For example the sensor output signal can contain information indicative of a tag identifier thus identifying the tag. Document movement can be detected by comparing the tag identifiers obtained from the first set of sensor output signals against the tag identifiers obtained from the second set of sensor output signals.

The receiver component comprises an antenna component e.g. in for sensing the a response signal from the tag . The receiver component further includes circuitry not shown for detecting a response signal picked up by the antenna. The receiver component constitutes a portion of the conventional interrogator device such as the one shown in . In this particular embodiment of the invention the transceiver component of a conventional interrogator is separated into a transmitter circuit component and plural receiver circuit components . The plural receiver components are disposed about the structure .

The input component is coupled to a document production component to produce copies or printout. A paper source feeds paper stock to the document production component. In this embodiment of the invention the RFID tags can be physically associated with the produced document by the document production component. For example a feeder mechanism for adhesive tags can be incorporated into the document production component that attaches tags to the paper stock as it passes during a copying operation or a printing operation. As another example a stapling mechanism having a magazine of staples comprising RFID tags can bind and tag multi page documents. Alternatively the paper stock itself may be tagged paper having RFID tags incorporated directly in the paper.

In the case of a facsimile transmission device the document production component might comprise data communication circuitry for connecting to a remote facsimile transmission device and communicating an electronic copy FAX of the document to the remote device.

The document processing device includes a suitable output tray provided for receiving the copy e.g. copied document printed document or the originals.

A detection module includes a signal connection to either or both the input component and the output tray . As will be discussed below the signal connection provides information about the document s present in the input component and or the output tray. The detection module feeds a signal to a recording component and to an appropriate server system .

A recording component is provided to record information that identifies an individual. The recording component can include an input device for users to key in or otherwise provide information indicating their identity which can then be use to activate the document processing device . The recording component can include a video recording device which produce an image of the individual. The image can then be fed to the server which can perform appropriate image analysis to determine the individual s identity.

In one embodiment the input component may include an RFID interrogation device for sensing source documents which contain RFID tags. A control signal is coupled to the input component to control the interrogation device e.g. to produce the interrogation signal. In the case of a copier the recording component can obtain information indicating of the user. The information can be an identification code or an image of the user. When source documents are fed to the copier the input component can sense tags in the source documents and send appropriate signals to the detection module . The signals fed to the detection module might include tag identifiers. The identification information supplied by the recording component and the tag information supplied by the detection module can be processed by the server . The server can then enable by way of suitable control signals for example the copying function based on the information received.

For example the tag information can be mapped to some information that identifies the document. As discussed above this information can be anything such as a document identifier an image of the document and so on. The tag information also can be mapped to corresponding permission information dictating what actions copy fax to a specific destination etc. are permitted for the particular user for the particular document. In general a requested action of the document processing device can be enabled or disabled based on information collected by the recording component and on the information received by an RFID interrogation device contained in the input component .

In yet another embodiment according to the present invention is the incorporation of a hash code in a re writable RFID chip tag . The hash code see for example the web site at http userpages.umbc.edu mabzug1 cs md5 md5.html for a discussion of the md5 hash algorithm can be applied to a digital representation of the document e.g. post script ps or scanned image before it is printed. The md5 hash is supposed to produce a unique 128 bit output for every unique document. The hash code can be stored in the RFID chip. Later a user needing to verify that two physical documents have exactly the same content can merely scan the RFID chip and compare the hash codes. Note that a visual side by side comparison of two document can be difficult especially if there are only small differences between the two versions of the document e.g. just a few words are different . However the comparison is extremely easy if the hash codes are used. Also note that the two documents being compared might have been printed at different times by different people in different locations according to different formatting rules e.g. single column format or double column format . The use of hash codes to compare two such documents would be extremely accurate. Also note that the comparison could be made at different locations by different people but sharing a common communication channel. This could be part of a contract signing process in which the same contract is printed at different locations by different people. The md5 hash code could be read from the chip and printed i.e. handwritten on the contract near the signature line. Images of the signed contract could be exchanged between the signatories. Each would be guaranteed that the content of the contract was exactly the same.

In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention the output tray may be provided with one or more interrogation devices disposed as illustrated for example in . In this embodiment any documents having physically associated RFID tags can be monitored for movement in the output tray. This can include monitoring for a change in position of the document or its removal. When sensitive material is left in the output tray it might be desirable to detect a change in position which can indicate that someone moved some documents to have a look at the sensitive information.

When movement is detected an appropriate signal from the interrogation device s is produced as discussed above. The interrogation output signals can be sent to the detection module . The detection module can then signal the recording device to capture audio and or visual information of the vicinity to record the event and the individual who caused the event. This information can then be sent to the server along with information obtained by the detection module from the output tray to record what document was moved or removed when the event occurred and the individual who caused the event.

The server can act as a central database to store the document history mentioned above. Document history can be accumulated in numerous ways. For example unconscious capture of documents is a technique whereby automatic document capture occurs without being initiated by the user. Such techniques are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5 978 477 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 347 953 filed Jul. 6 1999 the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. Other document capture schemes of course can be used to create the document history database. The history that is accumulated can then be searched based on content to retrieve documents and to view their security histories.

A desirable characteristic of the document security system of the present invention would be for the documents to carry their security histories in the RFID chips. This can be accomplished by using re writable RFID chips. Thus in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention a re writable RFID tag can be used to store portions of the document history. Referring back to the RFID interrogation devices and or can be configured to produce signals suitable to effect storage of information on re writable RFID tags disposed in the documents.

Re writable RFIDs allow users to easily determine information like when the document was printed when it was removed from the output tray who removed it when it was moved on a desktop etc. Storing the security history on the chip simplifies later access to that information since a network connection or retrieval from a central database are not required. It is can be appreciated that similar history information could be computed for documents that do not have re writable chips i.e. simple read only chips . Such information would be stored in a central database e.g. component in for storage and retrieval of that information.

In an implementation of this embodiment of the invention the security history of a document includes information representative of the locations where a document was present when it was present at those locations when it was moved while at those locations and when it was removed from those locations. An example of an entry in such a history might be 

This identifies the document generically as a 15 page document and associates that with a unique identification number that can be used to retrieve the contents of the document from a central database. It also identifies the device it was printed on Printer8780 and the date and time when it was printed. Of course this information could be compressed with generally well known techniques such as zip to reduce the storage space required on the chip.

The next entry in the history list would show the date and time when the document was removed from the output tray of the printer 

This could be performed by the interrogation devices and or that monitor the motion of the RFID chip attached to this document. The device s could include circuitry that writes the memory of the chip at the instant when the document is removed from the output tray.

However it is possible that the speed of the physical removal from the tray may exceed the speed of operation of that circuitry. In an alternative embodiment the device s could include rewriting circuitry that constantly rewrites the last history entry the removed record in a chip. This can be done while the document is present in the output tray but before it is moved. In this way no matter how fast the document is removed the time of that removal can be recorded.

A modified version of this algorithm shown in could also store an image in the removed record captured by a camera attached to the security system step . Even though many irrelevant images might be captured the algorithm would guarantee that the image finally stored in the removed record would be of the person who removed the document from the device.

Referring to for a moment a portion of a typical workflow is illustrated. This representation is an exemplar of a graphical representation of a workflow used to illustrate aspects of embodiments of the present invention. It can be appreciated that actual workflow systems will include additional tools for the user.

A workflow comprises a plurality of stages nodes of the graph and for example at which an action is performed on the document s . Each stage represents a location in the operation where the document can be routed e.g. someone s office or some other appropriate location for a particular given operation. The action may be a simple acknowledgment of having received the document or the action may be something more interactive such as a review and or editing or other annotation made to the document. The action may be a copy operation a fax operation or the like. There can be different kinds of stages. For example stages are examples of simple store and forward stages where a document is received an action might be performed on the document and the document is then passed on. Stages for example are branching stages where the document flow can proceed along alternate paths. The workflow is further defined by edges for example which connect the stages together to complete the flow graph.

In the particular example shown in a graphical representation of a workflow is illustrated. It can be appreciated however that other representational forms are possible. For example it may be more appropriate under certain situations to represent a workflow in a textual format. A machine interface may use a representational form more suitable for communication among computing equipment.

Returning to the workflow processor may be provided with appropriate user interfaces . As noted above the user interface can be a graphical user interface GUI presented on a suitable display device and having appropriate input devices e.g. keyboard voice input mouse and other commonly used input devices to facilitate creating and editing workflows. While a GUI is an appropriate interface a textual interface can also be used. Each user interface is in communication with the workflow processor via an appropriate communication channel such as a network type of connection a direct connection to the processor a modem connection and so on.

The workflow system shown in further includes a sensor processing component . This component can comprise a single computer device or other appropriate configuration. Sensors are disposed about the plurality of locations which can be included in a workflow. In one particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention the location of each sensor is known to the sensor processing component. In another particular implementation each sensor can provide information about its location to the sensor processing component. Each sensor can communicate information to the sensor processing component over a channel .

It can be appreciated that in a large enterprise the sensors might very well be distributed over a large geographic area. In such a case the sensor processing component might comprise a network of local computers where each local computer handles sensors local to that computer. For example a set of sensors in an office in Paris might be linked to a local computer in that office while a second local computer might be used to link together the sensors in an office in Tokyo. In such cases it is understood that an element e.g. sensor shown in can be viewed as a logical recursively defined representation of a local sensor group comprising a plurality of local sensors and a local computer communicating. The local computer communicates sensor data from its local sensors to the sensor processor .

In accordance with this embodiment of the invention each sensor is sensitive to proximity of one or more documents being routed in a workflow. In a particular implementation of this embodiment of the invention a radio frequency identification RFID system constitutes the sensor subsystem. RFID is a versatile wireless solution for identification. It has a wide range of applications from tracking books in a library to monitoring the movement of cattle on a ranch.

Referring for a moment to a basic RFID system comprises three components an antenna component coil a transceiver component and a transponder commonly called an RFID tag . The antenna component emits radio signals to activate the tag . Antennas are available in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Often the antenna component is packaged with a transceiver component which typically includes a decoder module. This combination is referred to variously as a reader an interrogator and so on. In operation the reader can emit radio waves interrogation signal in ranges of anywhere from one inch to several feet or more depending upon its power output and the radio frequency used. The transceiver component produces the interrogation signal which is then propagated by the antenna component.

When an RFID tag passes through the electromagnetic zone of the interrogation signal it responds to that signal and produces a response signal which is picked up by the antenna component and fed to the transceiver component . The decoder module in the transceiver decodes the response signal to extract the data encoded in the tag and the data is passed to a host computer for subsequent processing.

RFID tags come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some tags can only be read while other tags can be read and written. For example a product called the MU chip by Hitachi Ltd. is a 0.4 mmchip that is thin enough about 60 m to be embedded in paper and contains a read only memory ROM of 128 bits.

RFID tags are categorized as either active or passive. Active RFID tags are powered by an internal battery and are typically read write i.e. tag data can be rewritten and or modified. The battery supplied power of an active tag generally gives it a longer read range. The trade off of course is greater size greater cost and a limited operational life due to the limited life of the battery. Nonetheless it can be appreciated that active tags can be useful in the present invention under appropriate operational requirements.

Passive RFID tags operate without a separate external power source and obtain operating power generated from the interrogation signal transmitted from the reader. Passive tags are consequently much lighter than active tags less expensive and offer a virtually unlimited operational lifetime. The trade off is that they have shorter read ranges than active tags and require a higher powered reader. Read only tags are typically passive and are programmed with a unique set of data usually A to 128 bits that cannot be modified. For example the Hitachi MU chip comes preprogrammed with a 128 bit data word.

In accordance with the present invention physical documents have one or more RFID tags physically associated with them. Such documents can be referred to as tagged documents. A plethora of attachment processes are possible. An RFID tag can be attached by the use of adhesives. A clip which gathers together a multi page document can be provided with an RFID tag. For example a paper clip may incorporate a tag or a staple can be incorporated with a tag.

The attachment can be manual or by automation. For example a copying machine can be outfitted with RFID tagged staples or a dispenser of adhesive tags so that stapled copies can be tagged by way of the staple or single page copies can be tagged with an adhesive tag. RFID tags e.g. Hitachi MU chip can be embedded in the paper medium itself tagged paper .

In accordance with this particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention each RFID tag is associated with a unique identification referred to herein as a tag identifier. Furthermore when a tag is physically associated with a physical document there is an association between the tag identifier and document information relating to the physical document. The document information might comprise an electronic copy of the physical document an image of the document a reference which identifies the physical or an electronic form of document a reference identifying where an electronic copy of the physical document can be found references to other documents and so on. The document information might include information indicative of permissions for example whether a document can be copied or not. The document information might include ownership information document modification history information. In general one can appreciate that any kind of information may constitute document information. 

The document information can be collected at the time of creation of the document e.g. when the document is printed copied faxed or otherwise processed. The document information can be an accumulation of information collected during the lifetime of the document such as when modifications are made or when copies are made for example. A database system not shown can be provided to store such information or other suitable information management system. The database or information management system can be used to provide the mapping between tag identifier and document information.

Returning to it can be appreciated from that the plurality of sensors can comprise the transceiver and antenna component of an RFID system. Each sensor includes a transceiver circuit and an antenna for transmitting an interrogation signal and for receiving a response signal from a document . Each sensor further includes a communication component for communicating information received from the tag embedded in a sensed document i.e. the tag identifier to the sensor processing component . The sensor processor then associates the tag identifier with the particular sensor that transmitted the information. In an implementation of an embodiment of the invention the location of each sensor is known a priori. Consequently the sensor processor can make the further association of tag identifier with location of the tag and its associated physical document. Finally the database system can provide to the sensor processor a mapping of the tag identifier with an identity of the sensed document. Thus it can be seen that the location of a document is known insofar as the sensors can detect the document.

The workflow processing component is in data communication with the sensor processing component via communication channel . Communication between the workflow processor and the sensor processor can be provided by any of a number of known communication techniques. In one embodiment of the invention the two processing components could be subsystems in the same computer system. On the other hand in a large enterprise where a distributed architecture may be more appropriate the sensor processing component may comprise a plurality of local computer systems each receiving tag information from its associated RFID tags.

The sensor processing component transmits to the workflow processor information indicative of the sensed detected document s and information representative of the location where the document s were sensed. Alternatively the sensor processing component might transmit to the workflow processor the tag identifier along with information indicative of the sensor that received the information. The workflow processor can then make the necessary mappings to obtain a document identifier and its physical location. In a distributed environment comprising plural sensor processing computers some of the sensor processors may provide the mapped information to the workflow processor while other sensor processors might transmit the raw data to the workflow processor.

Assuming the workflow processor is in possession of information relating to a document and information indicative of its location the information can be used to enhance the workflow graph. Referring to the workflow segment illustrated in is shown as it might appear in a GUI. The figure illustrates a tracking feature of document flow wherein the physical location of a document can be tracked without information provided by a user sometimes referred to as unconscious tracking automated tracking and so on. Upon receiving an appropriate display command from the user the workflow graph presented to the user on a display for example as shown in can be enhanced with information from the sensors received from the sensor processing component .

As an example in the current location of a document is indicated by highlighting or some otherwise visually indicating the node stage in the workflow which corresponds to that current location. It can be appreciated of course that other indicating techniques can be used. Additional information can be presented as well. For example information indicating an action taken on the document might be displayed if available. The additional information can be another document s that has become associated with the document for example a reviewer of the document might attach or otherwise associate a related document to the document in the workflow.

At a step the tag identifier is associated with the document. This can be accomplished using information contained in a database for example containing a mapping between tag identifiers and document identifiers.

Certain actions can be taken on the document at steps and . For example the recipient may simply acknowledge receipt of the document. The user may annotate or otherwise modify the document e.g. by associating other documents with it and so on. The user interface can provide the necessary access and functionality to effect such actions. These actions can then be associated with the tag identifier by the workflow processing component .

The user can enter a display command at a step to display all or a portion of the workflow. The user might submit a command to display the current location of a particular document or documents. At a step the association among the information made in the foregoing steps can be used to identify the location s of the document s . The workflow can then be displayed where those stage s corresponding to the identified location s are highlighted in an appropriate manner to show their current locations. If tracking history is desired then in a step the workflow graph can be displayed in a manner to highlight the flow of the document in the workflow graph.

Similarly a printer having a sensor can detect printing of material. Stock paper having physically associated with it one or more tags can be detected by the sensor when processing a print job sent by a PC . A communication link from the printer and the PC can provide to the sensor processing component information indicating the tag identifier and the document being printed. This establishes the existence of the printed document and subsequent tracking of the document in the workflow. In addition the action of the printing of the document can be associated with the document and subsequently displayed to a user in the manner discussed above see e.g. .

The element can also represent a scanner device having a sensor . When a tagged document is scanned the sensor can detect the tag of the scanned document and communicate the tag identifier to the sensor processing component . The scanned data is stored in the PC as a document. A document identifier can be communicated to the sensor processing component to be associated with the tag identifier. In this way a tagged document in the workflow can be converted to electronic form. This action of scanning can be captured and associated with the document.

Users would scan a re writable RFID chip contained in the document using a suitable device more abstractly referred to as a workflow appliance . The workflow appliance can include a CPU central processing unit or other similar data processing component a memory component a display and a device for reading and writing the RFID chip and to provide user services such as logging in and so on. The workflow description can be downloaded from the RFID chip to the workflow appliance which displays the workflow diagram. The display can indicate where the document is in that diagram and what actions the user could take on that document. After the user takes one of those actions it is recorded on the chip and the diagram is updated and rewritten on the chip. That data can optionally be encrypted with the next receiver s public key. When that user opens the document he can decrypt it with his private key.

If the workflow description language is in a standard format users of an autonomous workflow system can easily process documents produced by different service providers. For example Blue Cross might use an Oracle Workflow system for their medical claim forms and Cigna might use an IBM system. However the workflow appliance in a Doctor s office does not need to know that. The information added to the form such as the name address and diagnosis code for the patient can be recorded on the chip using the standard format.

A further aspect of the various embodiments of the present invention include information recorded on the re writable RFID tag to direct the user to take certain actions. This provides a certain level of autonomous behavior in the document where the document can require the recipient of the document to take actions in a context directed manner. Information can be written to the RFID tag along the way in the workflow at its various stops by a backend workflow server. The information in the RFID can be updated at each stop or only at certain stops depending on the situation. In an extreme case the RFID can contain the entire workflow in which case the document is in essence a fully autonomous document instructing it s recipients via an appropriately configured workflow appliance where the next stop is or what the next action is.

For example the fragment of a workflow diagram depicted in shows an action being requested of a user Jan Brady. She has been asked to enter the identification information for the patient the diagnosis code and to send the form to the employer s account manager. The routing information for the possible receivers the account managers is provided so Jan knows where to send the paper form after it has been filled out. This diagram fragment can be represented in a text based format e.g. XML as shown in . Before the form is filled out the status is awaiting completion. After the form has been filled out the status is changed to in transit as it is being sent to the intended receiver. Since the hypothetical patient works for the Ricoh company the paper form was sent to Ronda Rice at 223 Villa Boulevard West Caldwell N.J. since she s the benefits manager for that company. It can be appreciated that this aspect of the invention allows for disparate workflow systems to co operate despite the differences in workflow procedure and policy that are likely to exist among the different systems. The amount of information contained in the RFID tag of course will depend on the storage capacity of the device. Additional devices may be incorporated. It can be appreciated that system requirements functional requirements performance requirements and other such factors will determine specific implementation details.

An external workflow system can be informed of this updated workflow diagram either online or asynchronously e.g. via an email message or not at all. Since the updated diagram is carried in the chip a network connection is not required when the document s information is updated. This can be a significant advantage since the physical location where the update occurs does not need to be equipped with a network connection. In fact a simple workflow status updating appliance is sufficient.

The workflow appliance reads the standard workflow description from the chip determines the actions that are possible displays those actions to the user provides a means for the user to enter the result of such an action and rewrites the memory of the chip to indicate the action that was performed. For example the workflow appliance shown in can be suitably configured with appropriate software to process documents in a financial institution s workflow. The user is being asked to verify the validity of the signature on the form by comparing it to information in the account record. The result of this action as well as the time date and place where it was performed are recorded on the chip. By reading and writing a standard workflow description language the appliance can process documents that are represented in a workflow system provided by any vendor that supports such a standard interface language. Standard workflow interface descriptions that provide interoperability between workflow systems are under development by industry groups such as the Workflow Management Coalition see for example the web site at http www.wfmc.org .
