The present invention relates to a substance useful as a therapeutic and or preventive agent for abnormal bone metabolism and a method of treating and or preventing abnormal bone metabolism.

Bone is known to be a dynamic organ which is continuously remodeled by repeated formation and resorption so as to change its own morphology and maintain blood calcium levels. Healthy bone maintains an equilibrium between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone mass is maintained constant. In contrast when the equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption is lost abnormal bone metabolism such as osteoporosis occurs WO 07 093 042 and Endocrinological Review 1992 13 pp. 66 80 .

As factors which regulate bone metabolism many systemic hormones and local cytokines have been reported and these factors collaborate with one another to form and maintain bone WO 07 093 042 and Endocrinological Review 1996 17 pp. 308 332 . As a change in bone tissue due to aging the occurrence of osteoporosis is widely known but the mechanism of its occurrence encompasses various factors such as a decrease in secretion of sex hormones and an abnormality in the receptors for the hormones variation in cytokine expression locally in bone expression of aging genes and osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation failure or dysfunction and thus it is difficult to consider it as a simple age related physiological phenomenon. Primary osteoporosis is largely divided into postmenopausal osteoporosis due to a decrease in secretion of estrogen and senile osteoporosis due to aging but advancement of basic research on the mechanisms of regulation of bone formation and bone resorption is essential to elucidate the mechanism of its occurrence and to develop a therapeutic agent therefor.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells and by releasing chloride ions and hydrogen ions on a bone surface to which osteoclasts adhere osteoclasts acidify a gap between the bone surface and the osteoclasts and also secrete cathepsin K which is an acid protease or the like American Journal of Physiology 1991 260 C1315 C1324 . This causes degradation of calcium phosphate activation of acid proteases and degradation of bone matrix proteins resulting in bone resorption.

Osteoclast precursor cells have been found to be differentiated into osteoclasts by stimulation with RANKL receptor activator of NF B ligand expressed on the cell membrane of osteoblasts stromal cells present on the surface of bone Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America 1998 95 pp. 3597 3602 and Cell 1998 93 pp. 165 176 . It has been revealed that RANKL is a membrane protein produced by osteoblasts stromal cells its expression is regulated by a bone resorption factor RANKL induces differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells into mature multinucleated osteoclasts and the like Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America 1998 95 pp. 3597 3602 and Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 1998 23 S222 . Further knockout mice devoid of RANKL have been found to develop an osteopetrosis like disease and therefore RANKL has been proved to be a physiological osteoclast differentiation inducing factor Nature 1999 397 pp. 315 323 .

As pharmaceutical preparations for treating bone metabolism diseases or shortening the duration of treatment bisphosphonates active vitamin D calcitonin and derivatives thereof hormones such as estradiol SERMs selective estrogen receptor modulators ipriflavone vitamin K menatetrenone PTH calcium preparations and the like are used. However these medicinal agents are not always satisfactory in terms of therapeutic outcome and the development of a medicinal agent with a more potent therapeutic effect has been demanded.

The cell membranes of immune cells are covered with a dense coating of various glycans such as sialylated glycans which are recognized by various glycan binding proteins. Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectins hereinafter referred to as siglecs are a family of type I membrane proteins which recognize sialylated glycans and bind thereto. Many siglecs are expressed on the cell membranes of immune cells and recognize sialic acid similarly present on the cell membranes of immune cells and regulate cell interaction or cell function and are considered to be involved in immune responses Nature Reviews Immunology 2007 7 pp. 255 266 . However there are also a lot of siglec molecules whose physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Siglec 15 Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin 15 is a molecule which has been newly reported to belong to the Siglecs see for example Non patent document 10 and is identical to a molecule called CD33L3 CD33 molecule like 3 . This molecule is highly evolutionarily conserved from fish to humans and has been found to be strongly expressed in dendritic cells and or macrophages of human spleen and lymph nodes. Further as a result of a binding test using a sialic acid probe it has also been found that human Siglec 15 binds to Neu5Ac 2 6GalNAc and that mouse Siglec 15 binds further to Neu5Ac 2 3Gal 1 4Glc and the like see for example Glycobiology 2007 17 pp. 838 846 . Until recently the physiological role of Siglec 15 had not been revealed however it has been reported that the expression of Siglec 15 increases with the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts and the differentiation of osteoclasts is inhibited by decreasing the expression of Siglec 15 by RNA interference see for example WO 07 093 042 . Further the effect of an anti Siglec 15 antibody on osteoclast differentiation has been revealed for the first time in WO 09 48072 published on Apr. 16 2009 however an antibody sequence which can be administered to humans has not been elucidated yet.

An object of the invention is to provide a gene which is specifically expressed in various forms of abnormal bone metabolism which are seen in osteoporosis rheumatoid arthritis cancer metastasis to bone or the like a substance which inhibits the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts and the activity thereof and a therapeutic and or preventive agent for abnormal bone metabolism.

The present inventors studied to elucidate the mechanism of osteoclast differentiation maturation and activation in order to find a substance having a therapeutic and or preventive effect on abnormal bone metabolism. As a result the present inventors found that the expression of Siglec 15 gene increases with the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts and also found that the differentiation of osteoclasts is inhibited by an antibody which specifically binds to Siglec 15. Further the present inventors humanized an obtained rat anti mouse Siglec 15 antibody and thus completed the invention.

 70 A method of producing the antibody according to any one of 3 7 and 10 to 30 comprising culturing the host cell according to 68 or 69 and purifying an antibody from the resulting culture product.

According to the invention a therapeutic and or preventive agent for abnormal bone metabolism whose mechanism of action is to inhibit the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts and the bone resorption activity thereof can be obtained.

The term polynucleotide as used herein is used with the same meaning as a nucleic acid and also includes DNA RNA probes oligonucleotides and primers.

The term osteoclast formation as used herein is used with the same meaning as osteoclast differentiation or osteoclast maturation .

The term functional fragment of an antibody as used herein refers to a partial fragment of an antibody having an antigen binding activity and includes Fab F ab 2 Fv scFv diabodies linear antibodies polyspecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments and the like. The term also encompasses Fab which is a monovalent fragment in a variable region of an antibody obtained by treating F ab 2 under reducing conditions. However the term is not limited to these molecules as long as the fragment has a binding affinity for an antigen. Further these functional fragments include not only a fragment obtained by treating a full length molecule of an antibody protein with an appropriate enzyme but also a protein produced in an appropriate host cell using a genetically modified antibody gene.

The term epitope as used herein refers to a partial peptide or a partial tertiary structure of Siglec 15 to which a specific anti Siglec 15 antibody binds. The above mentioned epitope which is a partial peptide of Siglec 15 can be determined by a method well known to those skilled in the art such as an immunoassay. However the following method can be employed for example. Various partial structures of Siglec 15 are produced. In the production of the partial structures a known oligopeptide synthesis technique can be used. For example a series of polypeptides having appropriately reduced lengths obtained by sequentially shortening Siglec 15 from the C terminus or N terminus are produced using a genetic recombination technique known to those skilled in the art. Thereafter the reactivity of an antibody against these polypeptides is examined and a recognition site is roughly determined. Then peptides having shorter lengths are synthesized and the reactivity with these peptides is examined whereby the epitope can be determined. Further the epitope which is a partial tertiary structure of Siglec 15 which binds to a specific Siglec 15 antibody can be determined by specifying the amino acid residues of Siglec 15 adjacent to the antibody by an X ray structural analysis. If a second anti Siglec 15 antibody binds to a partial peptide or a partial tertiary structure to which a first anti Siglec 15 antibody binds it can be determined that the first antibody and the second antibody share the same epitope. Further by confirming that the second anti Siglec 15 antibody competes with the first anti Siglec 15 antibody for the binding to Siglec 15 that is the second antibody inhibits the binding between Siglec 15 and the first antibody it can be determined that the first antibody and the second antibody share the same epitope even if the sequence or structure of a specific epitope has not been determined. Further when the first antibody and the second antibody bind to the same epitope and also the first antibody has a special effect such as an antigen neutralizing activity the second antibody can be expected to have the same activity.

It is known that each heavy and light chain of an antibody molecule has three complementarity determining regions CDRs . The complementarity determining region is also called the hypervariable domain and is present in a variable region of each heavy and light chain of an antibody. It is a site which has unusually high variability in its primary structure and there are three separate CDRs in the primary structure of each heavy and light polypeptide chain. In this description as for the complementarity determining regions of an antibody the complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are represented by CDRH1 CDRH2 and CDRH3 from the amino terminal side of the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and the complementarity determining regions of the light chain are represented by CDRL1 CDRL2 and CDRL3 from the amino terminal side of the amino acid sequence of the light chain. These sites are proximate to one another in the tertiary structure and determine the specificity for an antigen to which the antibody binds.

The phrase hybridization is performed under stringent conditions as used herein refers to hybridization that is performed under conditions under which identification can be achieved by performing hybridization at 68 C. in a commercially available hybridization solution ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution manufactured by Clontech Inc. or performing hybridization at 68 C. in the presence of 0.7 to 1.0 M NaCl using a filter having DNA immobilized thereon followed by performing washing at 68 C. using 0.1 to 2 SSC solution 1 SSC solution is composed of 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate or under conditions equivalent thereto.

The present inventors have found that the Siglec 15 gene is specifically expressed in giant cell tumors and have also found that the expression level of the Siglec 15 gene increases when a monocyte derived cell line differentiates into osteoclasts.

As for the Siglec 15 to be used in the invention Siglec 15 is directly purified from monocytes or bone marrow cells of a human non human mammal such as guinea pig rat mouse rabbit pig sheep cattle or monkey or chicken and is used or a cell membrane fraction of the above mentioned cells is prepared and can be used. Further Siglec 15 can be obtained by in vitro synthesis thereof or production thereof in a host cell through genetic engineering. In the genetic engineering production specifically Siglec 15 cDNA is integrated into a vector capable of expressing Siglec 15 cDNA and Siglec 15 is synthesized in a solution containing an enzyme a substrate and an energy substance required for transcription and translation or another prokaryotic or eucaryotic host cell is transformed to express Siglec 15 whereby the protein can be obtained.

The nucleotide sequence of human Siglec 15 cDNA has been registered in GenBank with an accession number of NM213602 and is represented by SEQ ID NO 1 in the Sequence Listing and its amino acid sequence is represented by SEQ ID NO 2 in the Sequence Listing. The nucleotide sequence of mouse Siglec 15 cDNA has been registered in GenBank with an accession number of XM884636 and is represented by SEQ ID NO 3 in the Sequence Listing and its amino acid sequence is represented by SEQ ID NO 4 in the Sequence Listing. Mature human Siglec 15 from which the signal sequence has been removed corresponds to an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 328 of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 2. Further mouse Siglec 15 from which the signal sequence has been removed corresponds to an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 341 of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 4. Incidentally Siglec 15 is sometimes called CD33 antigen like 3 CD33 molecule like 3 CD33 like 3 or CD33L3 and all of these represent the same molecule.

Siglec 15 cDNA can be obtained by for example a so called PCR method in which a polymerase chain reaction hereinafter referred to as PCR is performed using a cDNA library expressing Siglec 15 cDNA as a template and primers which specifically amplify Siglec 15 cDNA Saiki R. K. et al. Science 1988 239 487 49 .

Further a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to at least one nucleotide sequence selected from the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 in the Sequence Listing under stringent conditions and encodes a protein having a biological activity comparable to that of Siglec 15 is also regarded as Siglec 15 cDNA. Further a polynucleotide which is a splicing variant transcribed from the human or mouse Siglec 15 locus or a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a sequence complementary thereto under stringent conditions and encodes a protein having a biological activity comparable to that of Siglec 15 is also regarded as Siglec 15 cDNA.

Further a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence including substitution deletion or addition of one or several amino acids in at least one amino acid sequence selected from the amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4 in the Sequence Listing or an amino acid sequence obtained by removing the signal sequence from any of these sequences and has a biological activity comparable to that of Siglec 15 is also regarded as Siglec 15. Further a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence encoded by a splicing variant transcribed from the human or mouse Siglec 15 locus or an amino acid sequence including a substitution deletion or addition of one or several amino acids therein and has a biological activity comparable to that of Siglec 15 is also regarded as Siglec 15.

An analysis of the expression level of the Siglec 15 gene in a group of test samples from various human bone tissues showed that the expression level of the gene significantly increases in giant cell tumor GCT which is a bone tumor with a large number of osteoclast like multinucleated giant cells arising and is characterized by clinical findings of osteolytic bone destruction Bullough et al. Atlas of Orthopedic Pathology 2nd edition pp. 17.6 17.8 Lippincott Williams Wilkins Publishers 1992 .

It was also found that the expression level of the Siglec 15 gene increases when a monocyte derived cell line is differentiated into osteoclasts.

Accordingly Siglec 15 is considered to be associated with human pathologies such as GCT in which bone resorption is increased. In other words measurement of the expression level of the Siglec 15 gene and or Siglec 15 in each cell and or each tissue enables determination of the state of abnormal bone metabolism accompanied by overexpression of Siglec 15. The abnormal bone metabolism as used herein refers to a disorder characterized by net bone loss and specific examples thereof include but are not limited to osteoporosis postmenopausal osteoporosis senile osteoporosis secondary osteoporosis due to the use of a therapeutic agent such as a steroid or an immunosuppressant or osteoporosis accompanying rheumatoid arthritis bone destruction accompanying rheumatoid arthritis cancerous hypercalcemia bone destruction accompanying multiple myeloma or cancer metastasis to bone giant cell tumor osteopenia tooth loss due to periodontitis osteolysis around a prosthetic joint bone destruction in chronic osteomyelitis Paget s disease of bone renal osteodystrophy and osteogenesis imperfecta.

In the invention the test sample to be used for examining the expression level of the Siglec 15 gene and or Siglec 15 refers to a sample from a tissue of bone marrow bone prostate testis penis bladder kidney oral cavity pharynx lip tongue gingiva nasopharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine colon liver gallbladder pancreas nose lung soft tissue skin breast uterus ovary brain thyroid lymph node muscle fat tissue or the like or blood a body fluid an excretion or the like obtained from a test subject a clinical specimen etc. however in the invention blood or bone marrow is more preferred.

As for RANKL which is known to be associated with osteoclast differentiation a knockout mouse has been produced and the phenotype when the function of RANKL has been lost has been analyzed Young Yun Kong et. al. Nature 1999 397 pp. 315 323 . By producing a knockout mouse devoid of Siglec 15 in the same manner as above the phenotype when the function of Siglec 15 has been lost can be analyzed.

The antibody of the invention which is against Siglec 15 can be obtained by immunizing an animal with Siglec 15 or an arbitrary polypeptide selected from the amino acid sequence of Siglec 15 and collecting and purifying the antibody produced in vivo according to a common procedure. The biological species of Siglec 15 to be used as an antigen is not limited to being human and an animal can be immunized with Siglec 15 derived from an animal other than humans such as a mouse or a rat. In this case by examining the cross reactivity between an antibody binding to the obtained heterologous Siglec 15 and human Siglec 15 an antibody applicable to a human disease can be selected.

Further a monoclonal antibody can be obtained by fusing antibody producing cells which produce an antibody against Siglec 15 with myeloma cells to establish a hybridoma according to a known method for example Kohler and Milstein Nature 1975 256 pp. 495 497 Kennet R. ed. Monoclonal Antibodies pp. 365 367 Plenum Press N.Y. 1980 .

Incidentally Siglec 15 to be used as an antigen can be obtained by genetic engineering to cause a host cell to produce the Siglec 15 gene.

Specifically a vector capable of expressing Siglec 15 gene is produced and the resulting vector is transfected into a host cell to express the gene and then the expressed Siglec 15 is purified. Hereinafter a method of obtaining an antibody against Siglec 15 will be specifically described.

Examples of the antigen to be used for producing the anti Siglec 15 antibody include Siglec 15 a polypeptide comprising a partial amino acid sequence containing at least 6 consecutive amino acids of Siglec 15 and a derivative obtained by adding a given amino acid sequence or carrier thereto.

Siglec 15 can be purified directly from human tumor tissues or tumor cells and used. Further Siglec 15 can be obtained by synthesizing it in vitro or by causing a host cell to produce it by genetic engineering.

With respect to the genetic engineering specifically Siglec 15 cDNA is integrated into a vector capable of expressing Siglec 15 cDNA and Siglec 15 is synthesized in a solution containing an enzyme a substrate and an energy substance required for transcription and translation or another prokaryotic or eucaryotic host cell is transformed to express Siglec 15 whereby the antigen can be obtained.

Further the antigen can also be obtained as a secretory protein by expressing a fusion protein obtained by ligating the extracellular domain of Siglec 15 which is a membrane protein to the constant region of an antibody in an appropriate host vector system.

Siglec 15 cDNA can be obtained by for example a so called PCR method in which a polymerase chain reaction hereinafter referred to as PCR is performed using a cDNA library expressing Siglec 15 cDNA as a template and primers which specifically amplify Siglec 15 cDNA see Saiki R. K. et al. Science 1988 239 pp. 487 489 .

As the in vitro synthesis of the polypeptide for example Rapid Translation System RTS manufactured by Roche Diagnostics Inc. can be exemplified but it is not limited thereto.

Examples of the prokaryotic host include and . In order to transform the host cell with a target gene the host cell is transformed using a plasmid vector containing a replicon i.e. a replication origin derived from a species compatible with the host and a regulatory sequence. Further the vector preferably has a sequence capable of imposing phenotypic selectivity on the transformed cell.

Examples of the eucaryotic host cell include vertebrate cells insect cells and yeast cells. As the vertebrate cells for example dihydrofolate reductase deficient strains Urlaub G. and Chasin L. A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1980 77 pp. 4126 4220 of simian COS cells Gluzman Y. Cell 1981 23 pp. 175 182 ATCC CRL 1650 murine fibroblasts NIH3T3 ATCC No. CRL 1658 and Chinese hamster ovarian cells CHO cells ATCC CCL 61 and the like are often used however they are not limited thereto.

The thus obtained transformant can be cultured according to a common procedure and by the culturing of the transformant a target polypeptide is produced intracellularly or extracellularly.

A suitable medium to be used for the culturing can be selected from various commonly used culture media depending on the employed host cell. If is employed for example an LB medium supplemented with an antibiotic such as ampicillin or IPMG as needed can be used.

A recombinant protein produced intracellularly or extracellularly by the transformant through such culturing can be separated and purified by any of various known separation methods utilizing the physical or chemical property of the protein.

Specific examples of the methods include treatment with a common protein precipitant ultrafiltration various types of liquid chromatography such as molecular sieve chromatography gel filtration adsorption chromatography ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography dialysis and a combination thereof.

Further by attaching a tag of six histidine residues to a recombinant protein to be expressed the protein can be efficiently purified with a nickel affinity column. Alternatively by attaching a IgG Fc region to a recombinant protein to be expressed the protein can be efficiently purified with a protein A column.

By combining the above mentioned methods a large amount of a target polypeptide can be easily produced in high yield and high purity.

Examples of the antibody specifically binding to Siglec 15 include a monoclonal antibody specifically binding to Siglec 15 and a method of obtaining the antibody are as described below.

preparing antibody producing cells by immunizing an animal by injection of the antigen collecting the blood assaying its antibody titer to determine when the spleen is to be excised 

optionally culturing the hybridoma or rearing an animal implanted with the hybridoma for producing a large amount of a monoclonal antibody 

examining the thus produced monoclonal antibody for biological activity and binding specificity or assaying the same for properties as a labeled reagent and the like.

Hereinafter the method of producing a monoclonal antibody will be described in detail following the above steps however the method is not limited thereto and for example antibody producing cells and myeloma can be used other than spleen cells.

As the antigen Siglec 15 prepared by the method as described above or a partial peptide thereof can be used.

Further a membrane fraction prepared from recombinant cells expressing Siglec 15 or the recombinant cells expressing Siglec 15 themselves and also a partial peptide of the protein of the invention chemically synthesized by a method known to those skilled in the art can also be used as the antigen.

The antigen obtained in step a is mixed with an adjuvant such as Freund s complete or incomplete adjuvant or aluminum potassium sulfate and the resulting mixture is used as an immunogen to immunize an experimental animal. As the experimental animal any animal used in a known hybridoma production method can be used without any trouble. Specifically for example a mouse a rat a goat sheep cattle a horse or the like can be used. However from the viewpoint of ease of availability of myeloma cells to be fused with the extracted antibody producing cells a mouse or a rat is preferably used as the animal to be immunized.

Further the strain of mouse or rat to be used is not particularly limited and in the case of a mouse for example various strains such as A AKR BALB c BDP BA CE C3H 57BL C57BL C57L DBA FL HTH HT1 LP NZB NZW RF R III SJL SWR WB and 129 can be used and in the case of a rat for example Wistar Low Lewis Sprague Dawley ACI BN Fischer and the like can be used.

These mice and rats are commercially available from breeders distributors of experimental animals for example CLEA Japan Inc. and Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.

Among these in consideration of compatibility of fusing with myeloma cells as described below in the case of a mouse BALB c strain and in the case of a rat Wistar and Low strains are particularly preferred as the animal to be immunized.

Further in consideration of antigenic homology between humans and mice it is also preferred to use a mouse having decreased biological function to remove autoantibodies that is a mouse with an autoimmune disease.

The age of the mouse or rat at the time of immunization is preferably 5 to 12 weeks of age more preferably 6 to 8 weeks of age.

In order to immunize an animal with Siglec 15 or a recombinant thereof for example a known method described in detail in for example Weir D. M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology Vol. I. II. III. Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford 1987 Kabat E. A. and Mayer M. M. Experimental Immunochemistry Charles C Thomas Publisher Springfield Ill. 1964 or the like can be used.

Among these immunization methods a preferred specific method in the invention is for example as follows.

That is first a membrane protein fraction serving as the antigen or cells caused to express the antigen is are intradermally or intraperitoneally administered to an animal.

However the combination of both routes of administration is preferred for increasing the immunization efficiency and when intradermal administration is performed in the first half and intraperitoneal administration is performed in the latter half or only at the last dosing the immunization efficiency can be particularly increased.

The administration schedule of the antigen varies depending on the type of animal to be immunized individual differences or the like. However in general an administration schedule in which the frequency of administration of the antigen is 3 to 6 times and the dosing interval is 2 to 6 weeks is preferred and an administration schedule in which the frequency of administration of the antigen is 3 to 4 times and the dosing interval is 2 to 4 weeks is more preferred.

Further the dose of the antigen varies depending on the type of animal to be immunized individual differences or the like however the dose is generally set to 0.05 to 5 mg preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 mg.

A booster immunization is performed 1 to 6 weeks preferably 2 to 4 weeks more preferably 2 to 3 weeks after the administration of the antigen as described above.

The dose of the antigen at the time of performing the booster immunization varies depending on the type or size of animal or the like however in the case of a mouse the dose is generally set to 0.05 to 5 mg preferably 0.1 to 0.5 mg more preferably about 0.1 to 0.2 mg.

Spleen cells or lymphocytes including antibody producing cells are aseptically removed from the immunized animal 1 to 10 days preferably 2 to 5 days more preferably 2 to 3 days after the booster immunization.

At this time the antibody titer is measured and if an animal having a sufficiently increased antibody titer is used as a supply source of the antibody producing cells the subsequent procedure can be carried out more efficiently.

Examples of the method of measuring the antibody titer to be used here include an RIA method and an ELISA method but the method is not limited thereto.

For example if an ELISA method is employed the measurement of the antibody titer in the invention can be carried out according to the procedures as described below.

First a purified or partially purified antigen is adsorbed onto the surface of a solid phase such as a 96 well plate for ELISA and the surface of the solid phase having no antigen adsorbed thereto is covered with a protein unrelated to the antigen such as bovine serum albumin hereinafter referred to as BSA . After washing the surface the surface is brought into contact with a serially diluted sample for example mouse serum as a primary antibody to allow the antibody in the sample to bind to the antigen.

Further as a secondary antibody an antibody labeled with an enzyme against a mouse antibody is added and is allowed to bind to the mouse antibody. After washing a substrate for the enzyme is added and a change in absorbance which occurs due to color development induced by degradation of the substrate or the like is measured and the antibody titer is calculated based on the measurement.

The separation of the antibody producing cells from the spleen cells or lymphocytes can be carried out according to a known method for example Kohler et al. Nature 1975 256 p. 495 Kohler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 1977 6 p. 511 Milstein et al. Nature 1977 266 p. 550 Walsh Nature 1977 266 p. 495 .

For example in the case of spleen cells a general method in which the antibody producing cells are separated by homogenizing the spleen to obtain cells through filtration with a stainless steel mesh and suspending the cells in Eagle s Minimum Essential Medium MEM can be employed.

The myeloma cells to be used for cell fusion are not particularly limited and suitable cells can be selected from known cell lines. However in consideration of convenience when a hybridoma is selected from fused cells it is preferred to use an HGPRT hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficient strain whose selection procedure has been established.

More specifically examples of the HGPRT deficient strain include X63 Ag8 X63 NS1 ANS 1 NS1 P3X63 Ag8.U1 P3U1 X63 Ag8.653 X63.653 SP2 0 Ag14 SP2 0 MPC11 45.6TG1.7 45.6TG F0 S149 5XXO and BU.1 derived from mice 210.RSY3.Ag.1.2.3 Y3 derived from rats and U266AR SKO 007 GM1500 GTG A12 GM1500 UC729 6 LICR LOW HMy2 HMy2 and 8226AR NIP4 1 NP41 derived from humans.

These HGPRT deficient strains are available from for example the American Type Culture Collection ATCC or the like.

These cell strains are subcultured in an appropriate medium such as an 8 azaguanine medium a medium obtained by adding 8 azaguanine to an RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine 2 mercaptoethanol gentamicin and fetal calf serum hereinafter referred to as FCS Iscove s Modified Dulbecco s Medium hereinafter referred to as IMDM or Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium hereinafter referred to as DMEM . In this case 3 to 4 days before performing cell fusion the cells are subcultured in a normal medium for example an ASF104 medium manufactured by Ajinomoto Co. Ltd. containing 10 FCS to obtain not less than 2 10cells on the day of cell fusion.

Fusion between the antibody producing cells and the myeloma cells can be appropriately performed according to a known method Weir D. M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology Vol. I. II. III. Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford 1987 Kabat E. A. and Mayer M. M. Experimental Immunochemistry Charles C Thomas Publisher Springfield Ill. 1964 etc. under conditions such that the survival rate of cells is not excessively reduced.

As such a method a chemical method in which the antibody producing cells and the myeloma cells are mixed in a solution containing a polymer such as polyethylene glycol at a high concentration a physical method using electric stimulation or the like can be used.

That is in the case where polyethylene glycol is used in the solution containing a polymer at a high concentration the antibody producing cells and the myeloma cells are mixed in a solution of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1500 to 6000 more preferably 2000 to 4000 at a temperature of from 30 to 40 C. preferably from 35 to 38 C. for 1 to 10 minutes preferably 5 to 8 minutes.

The method of selecting hybridomas obtained by the above mentioned cell fusion is not particularly limited. Usually an HAT hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine selection method Kohler et al. Nature 1975 256 p. 495 Milstein et al. Nature 1977 266 p. 550 is used.

This method is effective when hybridomas are obtained using the myeloma cells of an HGPRT deficient strain which cannot survive in the presence of aminopterin.

That is by culturing unfused cells and hybridomas in an HAT medium only hybridomas resistant to aminopterin are selectively allowed to survive and proliferate.

As a cloning method for hybridomas a known method such as a methylcellulose method a soft agarose method or a limiting dilution method can be used see for example Barbara B. M. and Stanley M. S. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology W.H. Freeman and Company San Francisco 1980 . Among these methods particularly a limiting dilution method is preferred.

In this method a fibroblast cell strain derived from a rat fetus or feeder cells such as normal mouse spleen cells thymus gland cells or ascites cells are seeded on a microplate.

Meanwhile hybridomas are diluted in a medium to give a cell density of 0.2 to 0.5 cells per 0.2 ml. A 0.1 ml aliquot of the diluted hybridoma suspension is added to each well and culturing is continued for about 2 weeks while replacing about of the culture solution with fresh medium at predetermined time intervals for example every 3 days whereby hybridoma clones can be proliferated.

The hybridomas in wells for which the antibody titer has been confirmed are subjected to for example cloning by the limiting dilution method repeatedly 2 to 4 times. A hybridoma which has been confirmed to have a stable antibody titer is selected as an anti Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma strain.

Examples of the hybridoma strain thus cloned include hybridoma 32A1 described in WO 09 48072. The hybridoma 32A1 was deposited at the International Patent Organism Depositary of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology located at Central 6 1 1 1 Higashi Tsukuba shi Ibaraki ken 305 8566 Japan on Aug. 28 2008 and has been given an accession number of FERM BP 10999 under the name of anti Siglec 15 Hybridoma 32A1. Incidentally in this description the antibody produced by the hybridoma 32A1 is referred to as 32A1 antibody or simply 32A1 . Further antibodies obtained in the Examples of this description other than the 32A1 antibody are also represented by the antibody names in the same manner. A partial fragment containing the heavy chain variable region of the 32A1 antibody has an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 167 of SEQ ID NO 28 in the Sequence Listing. Further a partial fragment containing the light chain variable region sequence of the 32A1 antibody has an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 139 of SEQ ID NO 30 in the Sequence Listing.

By culturing the thus selected hybridoma a monoclonal antibody can be efficiently obtained. However prior to culturing it is preferred to perform screening of a hybridoma which produces a target monoclonal antibody.

The measurement of the antibody titer in the invention can be carried out by for example an ELISA method explained in item b described above.

The hybridoma obtained by the method described above can be stored in a frozen state in liquid nitrogen or in a freezer at 80 C. or below.

After completion of cloning the medium is changed from an HT medium to a normal medium and the hybridoma is cultured.

Large scale culture is performed by rotation culture using a large culture bottle or by spinner culture.

From the supernatant obtained by the large scale culture a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the protein of the invention can be obtained by purification using a method known to those skilled in the art such as gel filtration.

Further the hybridoma is injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same strain as the hybridoma for example the above mentioned BALB c or a Nu Nu mouse to proliferate the hybridoma whereby the ascites containing a large amount of the monoclonal antibody of the invention can be obtained.

In the case where the hybridoma is administered in the abdominal cavity if a mineral oil such as 2 6 10 14 tetramethyl pentadecane pristane is administered 3 to 7 days prior thereto a larger amount of the ascites can be obtained.

For example an immunosuppressant is previously injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same strain as the hybridoma to inactivate T cells. 20 days thereafter 10to 10hybridoma clone cells are suspended in a serum free medium 0.5 ml and the suspension is injected into the abdominal cavity of the mouse. In general when the abdomen is expanded and filled with the ascites the ascites is collected from the mouse.

By this method the monoclonal antibody can be obtained at a concentration which is about 100 times or more higher than that in the culture solution.

The monoclonal antibody obtained by the above mentioned method can be purified by a method described in for example Weir D. M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology Vol. I II III Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford 1978 .

That is examples of the method include an ammonium sulfate precipitation method gel filtration ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography.

As a simple purification method a commercially available monoclonal antibody purification kit for example MAbTrap GII Kit manufactured by Pharmacia Inc. or the like can also be used.

First examples of the identification method include an Ouchterlony method an ELISA method and an RIA method.

An Ouchterlony method is simple but when the concentration of the monoclonal antibody is low a condensation operation is required.

On the other hand when an ELISA method or an RIA method is used by directly reacting the culture supernatant with an antigen adsorbed solid phase and using antibodies corresponding to various types of immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses as secondary antibodies the isotype and subclass of the monoclonal antibody can be identified.

In addition as a simpler method a commercially available identification kit for example Mouse Typer Kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. or the like can also be used.

Further the quantitative determination of a protein can be performed by the Folin Lowry method and a method of calculation based on the absorbance at 280 nm 1.4 OD 280 Immunoglobulin 1 mg ml .

The antibody of the invention includes not only the above mentioned monoclonal antibody against Siglec 15 but also a recombinant antibody obtained by artificial modification for the purpose of decreasing heterologous antigenicity to human such as a chimeric antibody a humanized antibody and a human antibody. These antibodies can be produced using a known method.

As the chimeric antibody an antibody in which antibody variable and constant regions are derived from different species for example a chimeric antibody in which a mouse or rat derived antibody variable region is connected to a human derived constant region can be exemplified see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 1984 . As one example of the chimeric antibody derived from a rat anti mouse antibody 32A1 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 41 in the Sequence Listing and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 237 of SEQ ID NO 43 in the Sequence Listing can be exemplified.

As the humanized antibody an antibody obtained by integrating only a complementarity determining region CDR into a human derived antibody see Nature 1986 321 pp. 522 525 and an antibody obtained by grafting a part of the amino acid residues of the framework as well as the CDR sequence to a human antibody by a CDR grafting method WO 90 07861 can be exemplified. As an example of the humanized antibody of a rat antibody 32A1 an arbitrary combination of a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 51 in the Sequence Listing amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 53 amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 55 amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 57 amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 59 amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 99 amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 101 or amino acid residues 1 to 121 of any one of amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS 72 to 77 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 61 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 63 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 65 amino acid residues 21 to 132 of SEQ ID NO 67 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 69 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 71 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 103 amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 105 or amino acid residues 1 to 113 of any one of amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS 78 to 96 can be exemplified.

As a preferred combination an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 51 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 61 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 53 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 63 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 55 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 65 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 55 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 132 of SEQ ID NO 67 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 57 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 59 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 71 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 101 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 103 or an antibody comprising a heavy chain containing a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 140 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain containing a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 133 of SEQ ID NO 105 can be exemplified.

As a more preferred combination an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 51 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 61 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 53 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 63 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 55 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 65 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 55 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 237 of SEQ ID NO 67 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 57 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 470 of SEQ ID NO 59 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 71 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 466 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 466 of SEQ ID NO 101 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 69 an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 466 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 103 or an antibody comprising a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 20 to 466 of SEQ ID NO 99 and a light chain having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acid residues 21 to 238 of SEQ ID NO 105 can be exemplified.

However the humanized antibody derived from the 32A1 antibody is not limited to the above mentioned humanized antibodies as long as the humanized antibody has all 6 types of CDR sequences of 32A1 and has an activity of inhibiting osteoclast formation. Incidentally the heavy chain variable region of the 32A1 antibody has CDRH1 DYFMN comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 44 either one of CDRH2 QIRNKIYTYATFYAESLEG comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 45 and CDRH2 QIRNKIYTYATFYA represented by SEQ ID NO 97 and CDRH3 SLTGGDYFDY comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 46. The CDRH2 represented by SEQ ID NO 45 is in accordance with the Kabat definition SEQUENCES OF PROTEINS OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST VOL. I FIFTH EDITION 1991 . The CDRH2 represented by SEQ ID NO 97 is made shorter by five residues at the C terminus than the Kabat definition. In the heavy chain sequence containing this CDRH2 the CDR sequence derived from a rat is made shorter and more of a human framework sequence is incorporated and therefore when it is administered to humans it is much less likely to be recognized as a heterologous antigen. Further the light chain variable region of the 32A1 antibody has CDRL1 RASQSVTISGYSFIH comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 47 CDRL2 RASNLAS comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 48 and CDRL3 QQSRKSPWT comprising an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 49.

Further the antibody of the invention includes a human antibody. A human anti Siglec 15 antibody refers to a human antibody having only a gene sequence of an antibody derived from a human chromosome. The human anti Siglec 15 antibody can be obtained by a method using a human antibody producing mouse having a human chromosome fragment containing heavy and light chain genes of a human antibody see Tomizuka K. et al. Nature Genetics 1997 16 pp. 133 143 Kuroiwa Y. et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 1998 26 pp. 3447 3448 Yoshida H. et al. Animal Cell Technology Basic and Applied Aspects vol. 10 pp. 69 73 Kitagawa Y. Matuda T. and Iijima S. eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers 1999 Tomizuka K. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000 97 pp. 722 727 etc. .

Such a human antibody producing mouse can be created specifically as follows. A genetically modified animal in which endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene loci have been disrupted and instead human immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene loci have been introduced via a yeast artificial chromosome YAC vector or the like is created by producing a knockout animal and a transgenic animal and mating these animals.

Further according to a genetic engineering technique by using cDNAs encoding such a heavy chain and a light chain of a human antibody respectively and preferably a vector containing the cDNAs eukaryotic cells are transformed and a transformant which produces a recombinant human monoclonal antibody is cultured whereby the antibody can also be obtained from the culture supernatant.

Here as the host for example eukaryotic cells preferably mammalian cells such as CHO cells lymphocytes or myeloma cells can be used.

Further a method of obtaining a phage display derived human antibody screened from a human antibody library see Wormstone I. M. et al. Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science. 2002 43 7 pp. 2301 2308 Carmen S. et al. Briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics 2002 1 2 pp. 189 203 Siriwardena D. et al. Opthalmology 2002 109 3 pp. 427 431 etc. is also known.

For example a phage display method in which a variable region of a human antibody is expressed on the surface of a phage as a single chain antibody scFv and a phage which binds to an antigen is selected Nature Biotechnology 2005 23 9 pp. 1105 1116 can be used.

By analyzing the gene of the phage selected based on the binding to an antigen a DNA sequence encoding the variable region of a human antibody which binds to an antigen can be determined.

If the DNA sequence of scFv which binds to an antigen is determined a human antibody can be obtained by preparing an expression vector having the sequence and introducing the vector into an appropriate host to express it WO 92 01047 WO 92 20791 WO 93 06213 WO 93 11236 WO 93 19172 WO 95 01438 WO 95 15388 Annu. Rev. Immunol 1994 12 pp. 433 455 Nature Biotechnology 2005 23 9 pp. 1105 1116 .

The antibodies obtained by the above method are evaluated for the property of binding to an antigen by the method described in Example 25 or the like and a preferred antibody can be selected. As one example of another index when the properties of antibodies are compared the stability of antibodies can be exemplified. The differential scanning calorimetry DSC shown in Example 33 is an instrument capable of rapidly and accurately measuring a thermal denaturation midpoint temperature Tm which is a favorable index of relative structural stability of proteins. By measuring Tm values using DSC and comparing the values a difference in thermal stability can be compared. It is known that the storage stability of antibodies shows some correlation with the thermal stability of antibodies Lori Burton et. al. Pharmaceutical Development and Technology 2007 12 pp. 265 273 and a preferred antibody can be selected by using thermal stability as an index. Examples of other indices for selecting antibodies include as follows the yield in an appropriate host cell is high and the aggregability in an aqueous solution is low. For example an antibody which shows the highest yield does not always show high thermal stability and therefore it is necessary to select an antibody most suitable for administering to humans by making comprehensive evaluation based on the above mentioned indices.

Further a method in which the full length heavy and light chain sequences of an antibody are ligated using an appropriate linker whereby a single chain immunoglobulin is obtained is also known Lee H S et. al. Molecular Immunology 1999 36 pp. 61 71 Shirrmann T. et. al. mAbs 2010 2 1 pp. 1 4 . By dimerizing such a single chain immunoglobulin the resulting dimer can have a structure and an activity similar to those of an antibody which is a tetramer itself. Further the antibody of the invention may be an antibody which has a single heavy chain variable region and does not have a light chain sequence. Such an antibody is called a single domain antibody sdAb or a nanobody and in fact it is observed in camels and llamas and has been reported to have an antigen binding affinity Muyldemans S. et. al. Protein Eng. 1994 7 9 1129 35 Hamers Casterman C. et. al. Nature 1993 363 6428 446 8 . It can be understood that the above mentioned antibodies are types of functional fragments of the antibody according to the invention.

Further by controlling glycosylation in which a glycan is bound to the antibody of the invention it is possible to enhance antibody dependent cellular cytotoxic activity. As regards techniques for controlling the glycosylation of antibodies WO 99 54342 WO 00 61739 WO 02 31140 etc. are known. However the techniques are not limited thereto.

In cases where an antibody is produced by first isolating an antibody gene and then introducing the gene into an appropriate host a combination of an appropriate host and an appropriate expression vector can be used. Specific examples of the antibody gene include a combination of a gene encoding a heavy chain sequence of an antibody described in this description and a gene encoding a light chain sequence thereof. When a host cell is transformed it is possible to insert the heavy chain sequence gene and the light chain sequence gene into the same expression vector and also into different expression vectors separately. In cases where eukaryotic cells are used as the host animal cells plant cells and eukaryotic microorganisms can be used. As the animal cells 1 mammalian cells for example dihydrofolate reductase deficient strains Urlaub G. and Chasin L. A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1980 77 pp. 4126 4220 of simian COS cells Gluzman Y. Cell 1981 23 pp. 175 182 ATCC CRL 1650 murine fibroblasts NIH3T3 ATCC No. CRL 1658 and Chinese hamster ovarian cells CHO cells ATCC CCL 61 can be exemplified. Further in cases where prokaryotic cells are used for example and can be exemplified. By introducing a target antibody gene into these cells through transformation and culturing the thus transformed cells in vitro the antibody can be obtained. In the above mentioned culture method the yield may sometimes vary depending on the sequence of the antibody and therefore it is possible to select one which is easily produced as a pharmaceutical by using the yield as an index among the antibodies having a comparable binding activity.

There is no limitation on isotype of the antibody of the invention and examples thereof include IgG IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgM IgA IgA 1 IgA2 IgD and IgE and preferred examples thereof include IgG and IgM and further more preferred examples thereof include IgG1 and IgG2.

Further the antibody of the invention may be a functional fragment of the antibody having an antigen binding site of the antibody or a modified fragment thereof. The fragment of the antibody can be obtained by treating the antibody with a protease such as papain or pepsin or modifying the antibody gene according to a genetic engineering technique and expressing the modified gene in suitable cultured cells. Among these antibody fragments a fragment having all or part of the functions of the full length molecule of the antibody can be called a functional fragment of the antibody. As the functions of the antibody generally an antigen binding activity an activity of neutralizing the activity of an antigen an activity of increasing the activity of an antigen an antibody dependent cytotoxic activity a complement dependent cytotoxic activity and a complement dependent cellular cytotoxic activity can be exemplified. The function of the functional fragment of the antibody according to the invention is a binding activity to Siglec 15 preferably an activity of inhibiting the formation of osteoclasts more preferably an activity of inhibiting the process of cell fusion of osteoclasts.

Examples of the fragment of the antibody include Fab F ab 2 Fv single chain Fv scFv in which Fv molecules of the heavy chain and the light chain are ligated via an appropriate linker a diabody diabodies a linear antibody and a polyspecific antibody composed of the antibody fragment. Further Fab which is a monovalent fragment in a variable region of an antibody obtained by treating F ab 2 under reducing conditions is also regarded as a fragment of the antibody.

Further the antibody of the invention may be a polyspecific antibody with specificity for at least two different antigens. In general such a molecule binds to two antigens that is a bispecific antibody however the polyspecific antibody as used herein includes an antibody having specificity for two or more for example three antigens.

The polyspecific antibody of the invention may be a full length antibody or a fragment of such an antibody for example a F ab 2 bispecific antibody . The bispecific antibody can be produced by ligating the heavy and light chains HL pairs of two types of antibodies or can also be produced by fusing hybridomas which produce different monoclonal antibodies to prepare bispecific antibody producing fused cells Millstein et al. Nature 1983 305 pp. 537 539 .

The antibody of the invention may be a single chain antibody also referred to as scFv . The single chain antibody can be obtained by ligating the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of an antibody via a polypeptide linker Pluckthun The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies 113 edited by Rosenburg and Moore Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 Nature Biotechnology 2005 23 pp. 1126 1136 . Further a BiscFv fragment produced by ligating two scFv molecules via a polypeptide linker can also be used as the bispecific antibody.

The method of producing a single chain antibody is known in this technical field see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 5 260 203 5 091 513 5 455 030 etc. . In this scFv the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region are ligated via a linker which does not form a conjugate preferably via a polypeptide linker Huston J. S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1988 85 pp. 5879 5883 . In the scFv the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region may be derived from the same antibody or different antibodies.

As the polypeptide linker to be used for ligating the variable regions for example a given single chain peptide composed of 12 to 19 residues is used.

DNA encoding scFv can be obtained by performing amplification using a DNA encoding the entire amino acid sequence or a desired partial amino acid sequence selected from the heavy chain or the heavy chain variable region of the above mentioned antibody and the light chain or the light chain variable region thereof as a template by a PCR method using a primer pair that defines both ends thereof and further performing amplification by combining a DNA encoding a polypeptide linker portion and a primer pair that defines both ends thereof so as to ligate both of the ends to the heavy chain and the light chain respectively.

Further once DNA encoding scFv is produced an expression vector containing the same and a host transformed by the expression vector can be obtained according to common procedures. Further by using the resulting host scFv can be obtained according to common procedures. An antibody fragment thereof can be produced in a host by obtaining a gene and expressing the gene in the same manner as described above.

The antibody of the invention may be multimerized to increase its affinity for an antigen. The antibody to be multimerized may be one type of antibody or a plurality of antibodies which recognize a plurality of epitopes of the same antigen. As a method of multimerization of the antibody binding of the IgG CH3 domain to two scFv molecules binding to streptavidin introduction of a helix turn helix motif and the like can be exemplified.

The antibody of the invention may be a polyclonal antibody which is a mixture of plural types of anti Siglec 15 antibodies having different amino acid sequences. As one example of the polyclonal antibody a mixture of plural types of antibodies having different CDR can be exemplified. As such a polyclonal antibody a mixture of cells which produce different antibodies is cultured and an antibody purified from the resulting culture can be used see WO 2004 061104 .

As a modified antibody an antibody bound to any of various types of molecules such as polyethylene glycol PEG can also be used.

Further the antibody of the invention may be in the form of a conjugate formed between any of these antibodies and another medicinal agent immunoconjugate . Examples of such an antibody include one in which the antibody is conjugated to a radioactive material or a compound having a pharmacological action Nature Biotechnology 2005 23 pp. 1137 1146 .

The obtained antibody can be purified to homogeneity. The separation and purification of the antibody can be performed employing a conventional protein separation and purification method. For example the antibody can be separated and purified by appropriately selecting and combining column chromatography filter filtration ultrafiltration salt precipitation dialysis preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing electrophoresis and the like Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization A Laboratory Course Manual Daniel R. Marshak et al. eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1996 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual. Ed Harlow and David Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 1988 but the method is not limited thereto.

Examples of such chromatography include affinity chromatography ion exchange chromatography hydrophobic chromatography gel filtration chromatography reverse phase chromatography and adsorption chromatography.

As a column to be used in affinity chromatography a Protein A column and a Protein G column can be exemplified.

For example as a column using a Protein A column Hyper D POROS Sepharose FF Pharmacia and the like can be exemplified.

Further by using a carrier having an antigen immobilized thereon the antibody can also be purified utilizing the binding property of the antibody to the antigen.

From the anti Siglec 15 antibodies obtained by the method described in the above item 3. Production of anti Siglec 15 antibody an antibody which neutralizes the biological activity of Siglec 15 can be obtained. Such an antibody which neutralizes the biological activity of Siglec 15 inhibits the biological activity of Siglec 15 in vivo i.e. the differentiation and or maturation of osteoclasts and therefore can be used as a therapeutic and or preventive agent for abnormal bone metabolism caused by abnormal differentiation and or maturation of osteoclasts as a pharmaceutical. The abnormal bone metabolism may be any disorder characterized by net bone loss osteopenia or osteolysis . In general the treatment and or prevention by the anti Siglec 15 antibody are is applied to a case where inhibition of bone resorption is required. Examples of the abnormal bone metabolism which can be treated and or prevented by the anti Siglec 15 antibody include osteoporosis postmenopausal osteoporosis senile osteoporosis secondary osteoporosis due to the use of a therapeutic agent such as a steroid or an immunosuppressant or osteoporosis accompanying rheumatoid arthritis bone destruction accompanying rheumatoid arthritis cancerous hypercalcemia bone destruction accompanying multiple myeloma or cancer metastasis to bone giant cell tumor osteopenia tooth loss due to periodontitis osteolysis around a prosthetic joint bone destruction in chronic osteomyelitis Paget s disease of bone renal osteodystrophy and osteogenesis imperfecta however the abnormal bone metabolism is not limited thereto as long as it is a disease accompanied by net bone loss caused by osteoclasts. Examples of the anti Siglec 15 antibody to be used as the above mentioned pharmaceutical include a chimeric antibody and a humanized antibody produced from the 32A1 antibody by the method described in item 3. 3 Other antibodies . Further a chimeric antibody a humanized antibody and a human antibody sharing the same epitope as the 32A1 antibody can also be used as a pharmaceutical. Whether a certain anti Siglec 15 antibody shares the same epitope as the 32A1 antibody can be confirmed by observing whether or not these antibodies bind to the same specific partial peptide of Siglec 15. Further it can also be determined that if a certain anti Siglec 15 antibody competes with the 32A1 antibody for binding to Siglec 15 these antibodies share the same epitope.

The in vitro activity of the anti Siglec 15 antibody of neutralizing the biological activity of Siglec 15 can be determined by for example the activity of inhibiting the differentiation of the cells which overexpress Siglec 15 into osteoclasts. For example the anti Siglec 15 antibody is added to RAW 264.7 cells or RAW 264 cells which are a mouse monocyte derived cell line at various concentrations and the activity of inhibiting the differentiation into osteoclasts by stimulation with RANKL or TNF can be determined. Further the anti Siglec 15 antibody is added to bone marrow derived primary cultured cells at various concentrations and the activity of inhibiting the differentiation into osteoclasts by stimulation with RANKL TNF or active vitamin Dcan be determined. Further the anti Siglec 15 antibody is added to normal human osteoclast precursor cells Normal Human Natural Osteoclast Precursor Cells available from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. 2T 110 at various concentrations and the activity of inhibiting the differentiation into osteoclasts by stimulation with RANKL or M CSF can be determined. Such an inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation can be determined by using the inhibition of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase TRAP activity of osteoclasts as an index. Further the inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation can also be determined by using the inhibition of formation of TRAP positive multinucleated osteoclasts i.e. the inhibition of cell fusion of osteoclasts as an index. Further in an experiment utilising a pit assay Takada et al. Bone and Mineral 1992 17 347 359 using femur and or tibia derived cells the in vitro activity of inhibiting the bone resorption by osteoclasts can be determined by adding the anti Siglec 15 antibody to femur and or tibia derived cells at various concentrations and observing pit formation on a dentine slice. As a system for determining the in vitro activity of inhibiting the bone resorption by osteoclasts it is also possible to use a plate coated with human collagen conjugated to europium. The in vivo therapeutic or preventive effect of the anti Siglec 15 antibody on abnormal bone metabolism using an experimental animal can be confirmed by administering the anti Siglec 15 antibody to an animal model of osteoporosis or a transgenic animal which overexpresses Siglec 15 and measuring any change in osteoclasts.

The thus obtained antibody which neutralizes the biological activity of Siglec 15 is useful as a pharmaceutical particularly as a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing abnormal bone metabolism such as osteoporosis bone destruction accompanying rheumatoid arthritis or bone destruction accompanying cancer metastasis to bone or as an antibody for immunological diagnosis of such a disease.

In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA a major problem is bone loss accompanying the occurrence of the disease. It has been reported that in this bone loss accompanying RA osteoclasts play a primary role. The cytokines considered to be most important for osteoclast induction differentiation and maturation and activation and as the cause of bone destruction in RA are RANKL and TNF Romas E. et al. Bone 30 pp. 340 346 2002 . OCIF OPG which is a decoy receptor for RANKL can inhibit osteoclast formation induced by RANKL but does not inhibit osteoclast formation induced by TNF . On the other hand the anti Siglec 15 antibody according to the invention effectively inhibited osteoclast formation induced by both RANKL and TNF . Therefore it is expected that the anti Siglec 15 antibody of the invention can inhibit bone loss and bone destruction induced by TNF in RA or the like more strongly than an RANKL blocker OCIF OPG an anti RANKL antibody or the like .

As one example for the treatment or prevention of abnormal bone metabolism the anti Siglec 15 antibody can be administered alone or in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent for a bone related disease. As another example the anti Siglec 15 antibody can be administered in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent for abnormal bone metabolism. Examples of the therapeutic agent which can be administered in combination with the anti Siglec 15 antibody include but are not limited to bisphosphonates for example alendronate etidronate ibandronate incadronate pamidronate risedronate and zoledronate active vitamin D calcitonin and derivatives thereof hormones such as estradiol SERMs selective estrogen receptor modulators ipriflavone vitamin K menatetrenone calcium preparations PTH parathyroid hormone nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents for example celecoxib and rofecoxib soluble TNF receptors for example etanercept anti TNF antibodies or functional fragments of the antibodies for example infliximab anti PTHrP parathyroid hormone related protein antibodies or functional fragments of the antibodies IL 1 receptor antagonists for example anakinra anti IL 6 receptor antibodies or functional fragments of the antibodies for example tocilizumab anti RANKL antibodies or functional fragments of the antibodies for example denosumab and OCIF osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor . Depending on the state of abnormal bone metabolism or the intended degree of the treatment and or prevention two or three or more types of medicinal agents can be administered and these medicinal agents can be supplied all together by encapsulating them in the same preparation. These medicinal agents and the anti Siglec 15 antibody can be supplied all together by encapsulating them in the same preparation. Further these medicinal agents can be supplied all together by encapsulating them as a kit to be used for treatment and or prevention. Further these medicinal agents and the anti Siglec 15 antibody can be supplied separately. In the case of administration in gene therapy a gene of a proteinous therapeutic agent for a bone disease and a gene of the anti Siglec 15 antibody can be inserted downstream of the same promoter region or different promoter regions and can be introduced into the same vector or different vectors.

By conjugating a therapeutic agent for a bone disease to the anti Siglec 15 antibody or a fragment thereof a targeted drug conjugate as described in M. C. Garnet Targeted drug conjugates principles and progress Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 2001 53 171 216 can be produced. For achieving this purpose other than the antibody molecule any antibody fragment can be applied as long as it does not completely lose the ability to recognize osteoclasts and examples thereof include fragments such as Fab F ab 2 and Fv. In the invention the antibody and the fragment can be used in the same manner. The conjugate formed by the anti Siglec 15 antibody or a fragment thereof and a therapeutic agent for a bone disease can be any of various forms described in M. C. Garnet Targeted drug conjugates principles and progress Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 2001 53 171 216 G. T. Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press California 1996 Putnam and J. Kopecek Polymer Conjugates with Anticancer Activity Advances in Polymer Science 1995 122 55 123 and the like. That is a conjugate in which the anti Siglec 15 antibody and a therapeutic agent for a bone disease are conjugated to each other chemically and directly or via a spacer such as an oligopeptide and a conjugate formed via an appropriate drug carrier can be exemplified. Examples of the drug carrier include a liposome and a water soluble polymer. More specific examples of the conjugate formed via such a drug carrier include a conjugate in which the antibody and a therapeutic agent for a bone disease are incorporated in a liposome and the liposome and the antibody are conjugated to each other and a conjugate in which a therapeutic agent for a bone disease is conjugated to a water soluble polymer a compound having a molecular weight of from about 1000 to 100000 chemically and directly or via a spacer such as an oligopeptide and the antibody is conjugated to the water soluble polymer.

Hereinafter the invention will be more specifically described with reference to the Examples however the invention is not limited thereto. Note that the respective operations regarding gene manipulation in the following Examples were performed according to the methods described in Molecular Cloning written by Sambrook J. Fritsch E. F. and Maniatis T. published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press in 1989 or in the case of using commercially available reagents or kits they are used according to the protocols attached thereto unless otherwise stated.

A partial nucleotide sequence encoding the extracellular domain of mouse Siglec 15 protein is represented by SEQ ID NO 5 in the Sequence Listing and an amino acid sequence thereof is represented by SEQ ID NO 6 in the Sequence Listing. By utilizing such a partial sequence soluble mouse Siglec 15 protein can be produced in a culture supernatant of an animal cell or the like.

As primers for amplifying the mouse Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA by PCR an oligonucleotide having a sequence of 5 ggggacaagt ttgtacaaaa aagcaggctt caccATGGAG GGGTCCCTCC AACTC 3 mSiglec 15 ECD F SEQ ID NO 7 in the Sequence Listing and an oligonucleotide having a sequence of 5 ggggaccact ttgtacaaga aagctgggtc TCCGGGGGCG CCGTGGAAGC GGAAC 3 mSiglec 15 ECD R SEQ ID NO 8 in the Sequence Listing were synthesized according to a common procedure. Incidentally these primers were designed as amplification primers for producing a gateway entry clone such that an attB1 sequence is added to mSiglec 15 ECD F and an attB2 sequence is added to mSiglec 15 ECD R. The PCR was performed using this combination of primers and a polynucleotide containing an open reading frame sequence of the mouse Siglec 15 as a template according to a common procedure. The conditions for a thermal cycler were set as follows after heating at 94 C. for 5 minutes a temperature cycle of 94 C. for 0.5 minutes 55 C. for 0.5 minutes and 68 C. for 1.5 minutes was repeated 15 times followed by heating at 68 C. for 5 minutes and incubating at 4 C.

An entry clone into which the mouse Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA was integrated by the Gateway technology Invitrogen Inc. employing a lambda phage site specific recombination system was produced by the following method. First a BP reaction using BP Clonase was performed between the PCR product having an attB sequence at both ends produced in a and pDNOR221 manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. which is a donor vector having an attP sequence. By using this reaction solution DH10B was transformed colony PCR was performed for drug resistant clones and the size of inserts was confirmed. Then for a clone confirmed to have an insert with the correct size a sequence analysis of the total DNA sequence of the insert was performed. As a result an entry clone which is completely identical to the target nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO 5 in the Sequence Listing encoding the extracellular domain of the mouse Siglec 15 protein was obtained.

An expression clone into which the mouse Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA was integrated by the Gateway technology Invitrogen Inc. employing a lambda phage site specific recombination system was produced by the following method. The entry clone produced in b contains an insert having an attL sequence at both ends. An LR reaction using LR Clonase was performed between this entry clone and two types of destination vectors having an attR sequence. Incidentally as the destination vectors two types of destination vectors pDONM designed such that a V5 epitope tag and a 6 His tag are added to the C terminus of the insert and phIgFc designed such that a human Fc tag is added to the C terminus of the insert were used. By using the reaction solution obtained by the LR reaction DH10B was transformed and colony PCR was performed for the obtained drug resistant clones and the size of inserts was confirmed. Then for a clone confirmed to have an insert with the correct size a sequence analysis of both ends from the insert side to the vector side was performed.

As a result of the sequence analysis expression clones soluble mouse Siglec 15 pDONM and soluble mouse Siglec 15 phIgFc in which correct recombination occurred for both pDONM and phIgFc respectively were obtained. By transfecting the soluble mouse Siglec 15 pDONM into an animal cell or the like mRNA having a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 11 in the Sequence Listing is transcribed and translated into a protein mouse Siglec 15 His having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 12 in the Sequence Listing. Further by transfecting the soluble mouse Siglec 15 phIgFc into an animal cell or the like mRNA having a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 13 in the Sequence Listing is transcribed and translated into a protein mouse Siglec 15 Fc having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 14 in the Sequence Listing.

The two types of expression vectors soluble mouse Siglec 15 pDONM and soluble mouse Siglec 15 phIgFc obtained in Example 1 were prepared in an amount of about 5 mg respectively. Incidentally in the purification of plasmids from cultured on a large scale Invitrogen PureLink HiPure Plasmid Gigaprep Kit manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was used. The thus prepared plasmid was mixed with Opti MEM manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. the resulting mixture was sterilized by filtration 10 ml of a transfection reagent 293fectin manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was added thereto and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. This mixture was added to FreeStyle 293 F cells manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks such that the cell density reached 1.1 10cells ml 5 L 1 L flask 5 flasks in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. . After the cells had been subjected to culture with agitation 125 rotations min at a COconcentration of 8.0 for 96 hours 4 days at 37 C. the culture solution was collected and centrifuged to prepare a culture supernatant. It is considered that in the thus prepared culture supernatant a protein in which a V5 epitope tag and a 6 His tag have been added to the C terminal side of the mouse Siglec 15 extracellular domain mouse Siglec 15 His and a protein in which a human Fc tag has been added to the C terminal side of the mouse Siglec 15 extracellular domain mouse Siglec 15 Fc are expressed respectively.

To 2 L of the culture solution of mouse Siglec 15 His expressing 293F cells prepared in Example 2 225 mL of 10 buffer 500 mM Tris 1.5 M NaCl 200 mM imidazole pH 8.0 was added and the resulting mixture was stirred well and filtered through a Sterivex GV filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. . This culture solution was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml min to a column which comprised three HisTrap HP 5 ml columns manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. connected in series and was previously treated with a pyrogen removing agent PyroCLEAN manufactured by ALerCHEK Inc. and washed with distilled water for injection. After the column was washed with 60 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml min a protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 50 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 1 ml min. The eluate was fractionated at 1 ml per fraction into mini sorp tubes manufactured by Nunc Inc. to which 10 l of 10 Tween 20 had previously been added. After about 20 ml of a solution obtained by combining the fractions fractions 14 to 20 and containing the eluted protein was concentrated to 2.5 ml with a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the concentrate was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.01 Tween 20 T PBS followed by elution with T PBS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with T PBS was obtained.

To 3.5 ml of the sample which was purified by HisTrap HP column chromatography and whose solvent was replaced with T PBS 22.5 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS was added and the resulting mixture was stirred. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 4 C. for 30 minutes at 3 000 rpm and the precipitate was removed. After the resulting supernatant was filtered through a Millex GV filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the filtrate was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml min to a Resource Q 6 ml column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS. Thereafter the column was washed with this buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min and a protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the column was collected. A protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS and 1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml min. After 26.5 ml of the fraction which was not adsorbed to the column was concentrated to 2.0 ml with a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the concentrate was centrifuged at 4 C. for 10 minutes at 3 000 rpm and the precipitate was removed. The supernatant after centrifugation was cryopreserved at 80 C. until use. The above mentioned purification procedure HisTrap HP column chromatography and Resource Q column chromatography was performed by repeating it twice.

By using a sample prepared by the above mentioned purification procedure HisTrap HP column chromatography and Resource Q column chromatography SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions and silver staining were performed. That is to 5 l of each of the samples purified by the respective purification steps an equivalent amount of an SDS treatment solution was added and the resulting mixture was thermally treated at 95 C. for 10 minutes. 0.3 l of each of the thermally treated samples was used for SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. As a gel for electrophoresis an 8 25 polyacrylamide gradient gel manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. was used and the electrophoresis was performed using PhastSystem manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. . Further as molecular weight markers Rainbow Molecular Weight Markers manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. were used. After completion of the electrophoresis silver staining was performed using PhastGel Silver Kit manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. and PhastSystem. The results are shown in . It was shown that a protein having a molecular weight of about 35 kDa mouse Siglec 15 His was efficiently purified and concentrated in the protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the Resource Q column.

Electrophoresis was performed under the same conditions except that ECL DualVue Western Blotting Markers manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. were used as the molecular weight markers and the protein in the gel was transferred blotted to a PVDF membrane Hybond P manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. using a PhastTransfer Semi dry Transfer Kit manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. and PhastSystem. This PVDF membrane was gently shaken in 10 ml of a blocking agent BlockAce manufactured by Snow Brand Milk Products Co. Ltd. containing 0.1 Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 hour. To this blocking solution 10 l of S protein HRP manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. and 10 l of an anti V5 HRP antibody Monoclonal Antibody to Pk TAG HRP manufactured by Acris Antibodies were added and the membrane in the solution was gently shaken at room temperature for an additional 1 hour. The PVDF membrane was washed 4 times by gently shaking it in 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 0.01 Tween 20 for 5 minutes. After washing the PVDF membrane was treated according to the protocol accompanying an ECL detection kit manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. to develop the color of the band of the protein and the developed color was detected using an ECL Mini Camera manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. and Polaroid film Polapan 3200B manufactured by Polaroid Inc. . The results are shown in . Also from these results it could be confirmed that a protein which has a molecular weight of about 35 kDa mouse Siglec 15 His and reacts with an anti V5 HRP antibody was efficiently purified and concentrated in the protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the Resource Q column.

For the purified mouse Siglec 15 His the protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the Resource Q column the protein concentration was measured with a DC protein assay kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. As shown in Table 1 a total of 1.66 mg of purified mouse Siglec 15 His protein was obtained by performing the purification procedure twice.

1.8 L of the culture solution of mouse Siglec 15 Fc expressing 293F cells prepared in Example 2 was filtered through a Sterivex GV filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. and then the filtrate was applied to a HiTrap Protein A 5 ml column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with Dulbecco s PBS D PBS manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. at a flow rate of 5 ml min. After the column was washed with D PBS at a flow rate of 5 ml min a protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 50 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 3.0 at a flow rate of 5 ml min. The eluate was fractionated at 5 ml per fraction into mini sorp tubes manufactured by Nunc Inc. and immediately thereafter 1.3 ml of 1 M Tris was added thereto to neutralize the eluate. After a solution obtained by combining the fractions fractions 1 and 2 in which the eluted protein was detected was concentrated to 2.5 ml with a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the concentrate was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with Otsuka Physiological Saline for Injection TO SS manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. containing 0.01 Tween 20 followed by elution with TO SS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with TO SS was obtained. This sample was cryopreserved at 80 C. until use. By using 2.9 L of a culture solution of 293F cells the same purification procedure was performed by repeating it once more.

By using a sample prepared by the above mentioned purification procedure SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions and silver staining were performed. That is to 5 l of each of the samples purified by the respective purification steps an equivalent amount of an SDS treatment solution was added and the resulting mixture was heated at 95 C. for 10 minutes. 0.3 l of a sample obtained by diluting each of the thermally treated samples to 1 300 or 1 900 with a half concentration of the SDS treatment solution was used for SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The electrophoresis and silver staining were performed in the same manner as the purity assay of mouse Siglec 15 His described in c of Example 3. The results are shown in along with the results of examining preliminary purification conditions on a small scale the pH of the applied culture solution was 8.9 or 7.0 . It was shown that a protein having a molecular weight of about 55 kDa mouse Siglec 15 Fc was efficiently purified and concentrated in the protein fraction which was eluted from the HiTrap Protein A column.

For the purified mouse Siglec 15 Fc the protein fraction eluted from the PD 10 desalting column the protein concentration was measured with a DC protein assay kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. As shown in Table 2 a total of 92 mg of purified mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein was obtained by performing the purification procedure twice.

The mouse Siglec 15 His protein produced in Example 3 was prepared at 100 g 0.5 ml and an equivalent amount of an adjuvant was added thereto and an emulsion was produced using a glass syringe. As the adjuvant Freund s complete adjuvant FCA Manufactured by Difco Laboratories Inc. was used only for the first immunization and Freund s incomplete adjuvant FICA Manufactured by Difco Laboratories Inc. was used for the second immunization and thereafter.

Four rats Wistar female 6 weeks of age purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. were used as immunized animals. The emulsion obtained in a was injected subcutaneously and intradermally using a 27 G injection needle such that the amount of the antigen was 50 g per rat. Immunization was performed a total of 4 times every 7 days after the first immunization. A small amount 200 l of the blood was collected from the tail vein after 7 days from the date of the 4th immunization and an antiserum was prepared. In order to confirm the antibody titer of the antiserum ELISA using the mouse Siglec 15 His protein that had been used as the antigen the mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein produced in Example 4 or bovine serum albumin BSA each of which was immobilized was performed. As a result the reactivity with the mouse Siglec 15 His protein and the mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein was observed in all four rats rat Nos. 1 to 4 . On the other hand the reactivity with BSA was not observed. From these results it was confirmed that the antibody titer in the serum of each of the immunized rats increased and therefore the No. 2 rat which showed the highest antibody titer was subjected to a cell fusion procedure.

Cell fusion was performed according to a common method of fusing mouse rat spleen cells with myeloma cells. The whole blood was collected from the heart of the rat under ether anesthesia and the rat was euthanized and then the spleen was excised. The collected spleen cells and P3X63Ag8.653 cells ATCC CRL 1580 which are mouse myeloma cells were subjected to cell fusion using polyethylene glycol PEG . The resulting cells were seeded in a 96 well plate and a medium containing hypoxanthine H aminopterin A and thymidine T HAT selection medium was added thereto and then the cells were cultured for 7 to 10 days. The culture supernatant was collected from 61 wells in which the survival of hybridomas obtained by cell fusion was confirmed. Then the antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA using the mouse Siglec 15 His protein that had been used as the antigen the mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein produced in Example 4 or BSA each of which was immobilized and anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody producing hybridomas were screened. From the results of the screening 12 wells showing a high antibody titer were selected and the hybridomas contained in the wells were subjected to a cloning procedure.

For the thus selected hybridomas a first cloning step was performed by a limiting dilution method. After the limiting dilution the hybridomas were cultured for 2 weeks and the antibody titer in the culture supernatant was confirmed by ELISA using the mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein produced in Example 4 or BSA each of which was immobilized. For 11 clones which were confirmed to be positive clones a second cloning step was performed in the same manner as the first cloning step whereby 10 clones of the anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody producing hybridomas 1A1 3A1 8A1 24A1 32A1 34A1 39A1 40A1 41B1 61A1 were established in the end. Incidentally the hybridoma 32A1 was deposited at the International Patent Organism Depositary of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology located at Central 6 1 1 1 Higashi Tsukuba shi Ibaraki ken 305 8566 Japan on Aug. 28 2008 and has been given an accession number of FERM BP 10999 under the name of anti Siglec 15 Hybridoma 32A1.

The hybridomas established in Example 5 were cultured using TIL Media I manufactured by Immuno biological Laboratories Co. Ltd. medium containing 10 FCS. Subculturing of the cells was carried out by performing a procedure in which the culture solution was diluted to about one fourth every two to three days by using the time point when the cells were grown to about 5 10cells ml as an index. Each of the thus cultured hybridomas was intraperitoneally implanted in a nude mouse to which pristane had been intraperitoneally administered 0.2 ml mouse previously at 1 10cells per mouse. In the implantation three nude mice were used for each of the 10 clones of hybridomas. After the implantation the ascites was collected when sufficient accumulation of ascites was observed which was combined with those collected from the other two mice implanted with the same hybridoma the amount of the ascites thus combined was measured and the ascites was cryopreserved until purification of the antibody. The amounts of the collected ascites for the respective hybridomas were summarized in Table 3.

The total amount of the collected ascites was subjected to IgG purification using a 20 ml Protein G column manufactured by GE Healthcare Co. Ltd. . The purified IgG was assayed for purity by gel filtration analysis Superdex 200 column chromatography and some of the antibodies were subjected to centrifugal membrane concentration. That is among the purified anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies 9 types of antibodies except for the 24A1 antibody were concentrated to about one sixth to one eighth of the original volume by centrifuging the antibodies at 3 000 rpm for 30 to 60 minutes at 4 C. using a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. . Subsequently for the 24A1 antibody and the other concentrated 9 types of antibodies the protein concentration was measured with a DC protein assay kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using bovine serum albumin BSA as a standard sample. By the above mentioned procedure the anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody was prepared.

The property of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody binding to mouse Siglec 15 protein was evaluated by an ELISA method. The mouse Siglec 15 Fc protein produced in Example 4 was diluted to 5 g ml with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.5 and the resulting solution was added to a 96 well plate manufactured by Nalge Nunc International Inc. Cat. No. 430341 at 100 l well. After the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour the solution was removed and a washing buffer phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05 Tween 20 was added at 300 l well and then removed. After this washing procedure was performed one more time phosphate buffered saline containing 25 BlockAce manufactured by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd. was added at 200 l well and the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour whereby blocking was performed. The liquid was removed and the plate was washed twice with 300 l well of the washing buffer. Then each of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies prepared in Example 6 or rat control IgG manufactured by R D Systems Inc. was diluted to a final concentration of from 1.28 to 20 000 ng ml 5 fold dilution series with an ELISA buffer phosphate buffered saline containing 12.5 BlockAce and 0.05 Tween 20 and the resulting diluted antibody solution was added to the plate at 100 l well. After the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour the liquid was removed and the plate was washed 3 times with 300 l well of the washing buffer. Subsequently an HRP horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti rat IgG antibody manufactured by Beckman Coulter Inc. diluted to 1 000 fold with an ELISA buffer was added at 100 l well and the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour. The liquid was removed and the plate was washed 3 times with 300 l well of the washing buffer and then by using a color developing kit for peroxidase manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd. the color was developed according to the protocol accompanying the kit. After developing the color an absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a microplate reader manufactured by Nihon Molecular Devices Corporation . As a result it was confirmed that all of the examined 10 test samples of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies bind to the mouse Siglec 15 protein in an antibody concentration dependent manner . On the other hand in the case of the rat control IgG binding to the mouse Siglec 15 protein was not observed.

The femur and tibia were excised from a male ddY mouse at the age of 5 to 8 weeks and soft tissues were removed. Both ends of the femur or tibia were cut off and D PBS was injected using a syringe with a 25 gauge injection needle to push out bone marrow cells which were collected in a centrifugal tube. Centrifugation was performed at room temperature for 5 minutes at 100 g and the supernatant was removed. To the resulting cell pellet 1 ml of a hemolytic buffer Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. was added to suspend it and the resulting suspension was left at room temperature for 5 minutes. 20 ml of D PBS was added thereto and the suspension was centrifuged at room temperature for 5 minutes at 100 g and the supernatant was removed. To the resulting cell pellet 10 ml of MEM medium manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. containing 5 ng ml of M CSF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. and 10 fetal bovine serum FBS was added to suspend it. Then the resulting suspension was passed through a cell strainer 40 m Nylon manufactured by BD Falcon to remove aggregates. The resulting cells were transferred to a 75 cmT flask for the attachment of adherent cells and cultured overnight in a COincubator. After the overnight culture the cells which did not adhere to the T flask were recovered and used as mouse bone marrow nonadherent cells.

By using all of the 10 test samples of the anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies produced in Example 6 an effect on osteoclast differentiation of mouse bone marrow nonadherent cells was examined. The mouse bone marrow nonadherent cells prepared by the method of Example 8 were prepared at 1.5 10cells ml in MEM medium containing 10 FBS and 10 ng ml of M CSF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. and the resulting cell preparation was seeded in each well of a 96 well plate in an amount of 200 l and the cells were cultured for 2 days in a COincubator. The old culture solution in the 96 well plate was removed and 100 l of MEM medium was added to each well the 100 ml of MEM medium containing 10 FBS to which human RANKL RANKL manufactured by Peprotech Inc. and M CSF had been added to give final concentrations of 20 ng ml and 10 ng ml respectively. To the cell culture solution each of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies produced in Example 6 a sample obtained by removing sodium azide from commercially available rat control IgG purified rat IgG manufactured by R D Systems Inc. or a separately produced rabbit anti mouse Siglec 15 polyclonal antibody No. 3 was added at a concentration of from 32 to 1 000 ng ml and the cells were cultured for an additional 3 days in a COincubator. Incidentally the polyclonal antibody No. 3 is an antibody which has already been confirmed to inhibit osteoclast formation in the experimental system described in this Example. After completion of the culturing the activity of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase TRAP of the formed osteoclasts was measured by a procedure described below. The culture solution in each well of the 96 well plate was removed by suction and 50 l of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6.1 containing 1 Triton X 100 was added to each well. Then the plate was shaken for 5 minutes on a plate shaker to lyse the cells. To each well 50 l of a substrate solution 50 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6.1 containing 5 mg ml p nitrophenyl phosphate and 0.46 sodium tartrate was added and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. After the incubation 50 l of a 1 N sodium hydroxide solution was added to each well of the 96 well plate to stop the enzymatic reaction. After stopping the enzymatic reaction an absorbance of each well at 405 nm was measured and the obtained measurement was used as an index of TRAP activity. The results are shown in . A significant inhibition of TRAP activity was not observed in the case of the commercially available rat control IgG. On the other hand a significant inhibition of TRAP activity was observed in the cases of the 32A1 antibody added in the range of from 32 ng ml to 1000 ng ml and the 8A1 antibody and the affinity purified rabbit polyclonal No. 3 antibody added in the range of from 63 ng ml to 1000 ng ml. Also in the cases of the 3A1 antibody 34A1 antibody and 39A1 antibody a dose dependent inhibition of TRAP activity was observed at a relatively high concentration of 500 ng ml or higher. The inhibition of mouse osteoclast formation by the other antibodies was not observed. From the above results antibodies which strongly inhibit mouse osteoclast formation osteoclast differentiation and maturation were found among the prepared rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies. Further as a property common to the 3A1 antibody 8A1 antibody 32A1 antibody 34A1 antibody and 39A1 antibody the activity of inhibiting osteoclast formation at a concentration of 1000 ng ml i.e. 1 g ml or less can be exemplified.

A partial nucleotide sequence encoding the extracellular domain of human Siglec 15 protein is represented by SEQ ID NO 15 in the Sequence Listing and the amino acid sequence thereof is represented by SEQ ID NO 16 in the Sequence Listing. By utilizing such a partial sequence soluble human Siglec 15 protein can be produced in a culture supernatant of an animal cell or the like.

As primers for amplifying the human Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA by PCR an oligonucleotide having a sequence of 5 ggggacaagt ttgtacaaaa aagcaggctt caccATGGAA AAGTCCATCT GGCTGC 3 hSiglec 15 ECD F SEQ ID NO 17 in the Sequence Listing and an oligonucleotide having a sequence of 5 ggggaccact ttgtacaaga aagctgggtc CCCGCTGGCG CCATGGAAGC GG 3 hSiglec 15 ECD R SEQ ID NO 18 in the Sequence Listing were synthesized according to a common procedure. Incidentally these primers were designed as amplification primers for producing a gateway entry clone such that an attB1 sequence is added to hSiglec 15 ECD F and an attB2 sequence is added to hSiglec 15 ECD R. The PCR was performed using this combination of primers and a polynucleotide containing an open reading sequence of the human Siglec 15 as a template according to a common procedure. The resulting PCR reaction solution was purified using PureLink PCR Purification Kit manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. .

An entry clone into which the human Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA was integrated by the Gateway technology Invitrogen Inc. employing a lambda phage site specific recombination system was produced by the following method. First a BP reaction using BP Clonase was performed between the PCR product having an attB sequence at both ends produced in a and pDNOR221 manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. which is a donor vector having an attP sequence. By using this reaction solution TOP10 was transformed colony PCR was performed for drug resistant clones and the size of inserts was confirmed. Then for a clone confirmed to have an insert with the correct size a sequence analysis of the total DNA sequence of the insert was performed. As a result an entry clone which is completely identical to the target nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO 15 in the Sequence Listing encoding the extracellular domain of the human Siglec 15 protein was obtained.

An expression clone into which the human Siglec 15 extracellular domain cDNA was integrated by the Gateway technology Invitrogen Inc. employing a lambda phage site specific recombination system was produced by the following method. The entry clone produced in b contains an insert having an attL sequence at both ends. An LR reaction using LR Clonase was performed between this entry clone and two types of destination vectors having an attR sequence. Incidentally as the destination vectors two types of destination vectors pDONM designed such that a V5 epitope tag and a 6 His tag are added to the C terminus of the insert and phIgFc designed such that a human Fc tag is added to the C terminus of the insert were used. By using the reaction solution obtained by the LR reaction TOP10 was transformed and a sequence analysis was performed for the resulting drug resistant clones to confirm whether correct recombination occurred.

As a result of the sequence analysis expression clones soluble human Siglec 15 pDONM and soluble human Siglec 15 phIgFc in which correct recombination occurred for both pDONM and phIgFc respectively were obtained. By transfecting the soluble human Siglec 15 pDONM into an animal cell or the like mRNA having a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 19 in the Sequence Listing is transcribed and translated into a protein human Siglec 15 His having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 20 in the Sequence Listing. Further by transfecting the soluble human Siglec 15 phIgFc into an animal cell or the like mRNA having a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 21 in the Sequence Listing is transcribed and translated into a protein human Siglec 15 Fc having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 22 in the Sequence Listing.

The soluble human Siglec 15 pDONM obtained in Example 10 was prepared in an amount of about 25 mg. Incidentally in the purification of plasmids from cultured on a large scale Invitrogen PureLink HiPure Plasmid Gigaprep Kit manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was used. The thus prepared plasmid was mixed with Opti MEM manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. 50 ml of transfection reagent 293fectin manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was added thereto and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. This mixture was added to FreeStyle 293 F cells manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. containing 1 penicillin streptomycin such that the cell density reached 1.0 to 3.4 10cells ml using a 25 L bioprocess culture apparatus WAVE Bioreactor . After the cells had been subjected to culture with agitation 30 rotations min at a COconcentration of from 6 to 12 for 96 hours 4 days at 37 C. the culture solution was collected and centrifuged to prepare a culture supernatant. It is observed that in the thus prepared culture supernatant a protein in which a V5 epitope tag and a 6 His tag have been added to the C terminal side of the human Siglec 15 extracellular domain human Siglec 15 His is expressed.

The soluble human Siglec 15 phIgFc obtained in Example 10 was prepared in an amount of about 5 mg. Incidentally in the purification of plasmids from cultured on a large scale Invitrogen PureLink HiPure Plasmid Gigaprep Kit manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was used. The thus prepared plasmid was mixed with Opti MEM manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. followed by filter sterilization. Then 10 ml of a transfection reagent 293fectin manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. was added thereto and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. This mixture was added to FreeStyle 293 F cells manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks such that the cell density reached 1.0 to 3.0 10cells ml 5 L 1 L flask 5 flasks in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. . After the cells had been subjected to culture with agitation 125 rotations min at a COconcentration of 8.0 for 96 hours 4 days at 37 C. the culture solution was collected and centrifuged to prepare a culture supernatant. It is observed that in the thus prepared culture supernatant a protein in which a human Fc tag has been added to the C terminal side of the human Siglec 15 extracellular domain human Siglec 15 Fc is expressed.

To 12 L of the culture solution of 293F cells expressing human Siglec 15 His prepared in a of Example 11 1350 mL of 10 buffer 500 mM Tris 1.5 M NaCl 200 mM imidazole pH 8.0 was added and the resulting mixture was stirred well and filtered through a MilliPak 60 filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. . This culture solution was applied at a flow rate of 10 ml min to a Ni Sepharose HP manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. 100 ml column which had previously been washed with pure water Milli Q water . After the column had been washed with 400 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 8 mL min a protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 200 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min and the eluate was fractionated into mini sorp tubes manufactured by Nunc Inc. . In order to prevent precipitation of the protein 8 ml of a 5 M NaCl solution was added to about 40 ml of a fraction containing the eluted protein followed by stirring and then the resulting mixture was concentrated to about 20 ml with a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. . Insoluble matter generated during the concentration was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. and 2.5 ml of the resulting supernatant was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline containing 1 M NaCl N PBS followed by elution with N PBS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with N PBS was obtained. This procedure was performed by repeating it 7 more times and about 28 ml of a solution of partially purified human Siglec 15 His was obtained.

12 ml of the sample which had been purified by Ni Sepharose HP column chromatography and whose solvent had been replaced with N PBS was dialyzed overnight at 4 C. against 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS 1 L 3 times and the resulting dialysate was centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. and the precipitate was removed. After the resulting supernatant had been filtered through a Millex GV filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the filtrate was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml min to a Resource Q 6 ml column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS. Thereafter the column was washed with this buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min and a protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the column was collected. A protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 CHAPS and 1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml min. After 26.5 ml of the fraction which had not been adsorbed to the column was concentrated to 3.0 ml with a centrifugal membrane concentrator Amicon Ultra 15 manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. the concentrate was centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. and the precipitate was removed. 2.5 ml of the resulting supernatant was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline containing 50 mM arginine hydrochloride pH 7.0 A PBS followed by elution with A PBS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with A PBS was obtained. The arginine hydrochloride in the solvent of the prepared sample was added in order to prevent soluble human Siglec 15 His from precipitating. The supernatant after centrifugation was cryopreserved at 80 C. until use. The above mentioned purification procedure Resource Q column chromatography was performed by repeating it twice.

By using a sample prepared by the above mentioned purification procedure Ni Sepharose HP column chromatography and Resource Q column chromatography SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions and silver staining were performed. That is to 5 l of each of the samples purified by the respective purification steps an equivalent amount of an SDS treatment solution was added and the resulting mixture was thermally treated at 95 C. for 10 minutes. 0.3 l of each of the thermally treated samples was used for SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The electrophoresis procedure was performed in the same manner as in Example 3 except that Rainbow Molecular Weight Markers manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. were used as the molecular weight markers. After completion of the electrophoresis silver staining was performed using a PhastGel Silver Kit manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. and PhastSystem. The results are shown in . It was shown that a protein having a molecular weight of about 35 kDa human Siglec 15 His was efficiently purified and concentrated in the protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the Resource Q column.

For the purified human Siglec 15 His the protein fraction which was not adsorbed to the Resource Q column the protein concentration was measured with a DC protein assay kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. By performing the purification procedure twice a total of 1.66 mg of purified human Siglec 15 His was obtained.

1.5 L of the culture solution of 293F cells expressing human Siglec 15 Fc prepared in b of Example 11 was filtered through a Sterivex GV filter manufactured by Millipore Co. Ltd. and then the filtrate was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml min to a HiTrap Protein A 5 ml column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with Dulbecco s PBS D PBS manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. . After the column had been washed with 70 ml of D PBS at a flow rate of 5 ml min a protein adsorbed to the column was eluted with 24 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 3.0 at a flow rate of 1.2 ml min. The eluate was fractionated at 1.2 ml per fraction into mini sorp tubes manufactured by Nunc Inc. and immediately thereafter 0.31 ml of 1 M Tris was added thereto to neutralize the eluate. A 2.5 ml aliquot of a solution about 7.5 ml obtained by combining the eluted protein fractions fractions 5 to 9 was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline containing 50 mM arginine hydrochloride pH 7.0 A PBS followed by elution with A PBS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with A PBS was obtained. This procedure was performed by repeating it twice. The arginine hydrochloride in the solvent was added in order to prevent soluble human Siglec 15 Fc from precipitating. 2.5 ml of the remaining solution of the eluted protein fractions fractions 5 to 9 was applied to a PD 10 desalting column manufactured by Amersham Biosciences Inc. which had previously been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline containing 1 M NaCl pH 6.7 N PBS followed by elution with N PBS whereby 3.5 ml of a sample whose solvent was replaced with N PBS was obtained. NaCl in the solvent in the prepared sample was added in order to prevent soluble human Siglec 15 Fc from precipitating without adding an amino group containing compound such as arginine. The samples prepared by the above mentioned procedure were cryopreserved at 80 C. until use.

By using the samples prepared by the above mentioned purification procedure SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions and silver staining were performed. That is to 5 l of each of the samples purified by the respective purification steps an equivalent amount of an SDS treatment solution was added and the resulting mixture was heated at 95 C. for 10 minutes. 0.3 l of a sample obtained by diluting each of the thermally treated samples to 1 100 or 1 300 with a half concentration of the SDS treatment solution was used for SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The electrophoresis and silver staining were performed in the same manner as the purity assay of human Siglec 15 His described in a iii . The results are shown in . It was shown that a protein having a molecular weight of about 55 kDa human Siglec 15 Fc was efficiently purified and concentrated in the protein fraction which was eluted from the HiTrap Protein A column.

For the purified human Siglec 15 Fc the protein fraction eluted from the PD 10 desalting column the protein concentration was measured with a DC protein assay kit manufactured by Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. As shown in Table 4 a total of 25.2 mg of purified human Siglec 15 Fc was obtained by performing the purification procedure twice.

The property of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody binding to human Siglec 15 protein was evaluated by an ELISA method. The human Siglec 15 Fc protein subjected to replacement with A PBS produced in b of Example 12 was diluted to 5 g ml with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.5 and the resulting solution was added to a 96 well plate manufactured by Nalge Nunc International Inc. Cat. No. 430341 at 100 l well. After the plate had been left at room temperature for 1 hour the solution was removed and a washing buffer phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05 Tween 20 was added at 300 l well and then removed. After this washing procedure had been performed one more time phosphate buffered saline containing 25 BlockAce manufactured by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd. was added at 200 l well and the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour whereby blocking was performed. The liquid was removed and the plate was washed twice with 300 l well of the washing buffer. Then each of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies prepared in Example 6 or rat control IgG manufactured by R D Systems Inc. was diluted to a final concentration of from 1.28 to 20 000 ng ml 5 fold dilution series with an ELISA buffer phosphate buffered saline containing 12.5 BlockAce and 0.05 Tween 20 and the resulting diluted antibody solution was added to the plate at 100 l well. After the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour the liquid was removed and the plate was washed 3 times with 300 l well of the washing buffer. Subsequently an HRP horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti rat IgG antibody manufactured by Beckman Coulter Inc. diluted to 1 000 fold with an ELISA buffer was added at 100 l well and the plate was left at room temperature for 1 hour. The liquid was removed and the plate was washed 3 times with 300 l well of the washing buffer and then by using a color developing kit for peroxidase manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd. the color was developed according to the protocol accompanying the kit. After developing the color an absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a microplate reader manufactured by Nihon Molecular Devices Corporation . As a result it was confirmed that all of the examined 10 test samples of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies bind to the human Siglec 15 protein in an antibody concentration dependent manner . In particular the binding activity of 5 test samples namely 1A1 3A1 24A1 32A1 and 61A1 was high and the binding activity of 3 test samples namely 8A1 34A1 and 39A1 was relatively low. On the other hand in the case of the rat control IgG binding to the human Siglec 15 protein was not observed. From the above results it was shown that the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies prepared in Example 6 bind not only to mouse Siglec 15 but also to human Siglec 15 and moreover it was found that some antibodies strongly bind to human Siglec 15.

Since it was confirmed that the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies bind also to human Siglec 15 in Example 13 the effects of these antibodies on human osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity were examined.

Effect of Addition of Rat Anti Mouse Siglec 15 Monoclonal Antibody on Cell Fusion of Osteoclasts from Normal Human Osteoclast Precursor Cells TRAP Staining 

Normal human osteoclast precursor cells Normal Human Natural Osteoclast Precursor Cells purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. 2T 110 were seeded in a 96 well plate at 1 10cells well according to the protocol accompanying the cells. As the medium a minimal essential medium for osteoclast precursor cells OPBM purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. PT 8201 supplemented with an OPGM supplement set purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. PT 9501 containing fetal bovine serum final concentration 10 human RANKL final concentration 66 ng ml human M CSF final concentration 33 ng ml and the like was used. To the resulting culture supernatant each of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies prepared in Example 6 or rat control IgG manufactured by R D Systems Inc. was added to give a final concentration of 30 g ml and the cells were cultured for 4 days in a COincubator. After the culturing the supernatant was removed and 10 neutral formalin was added to fix the cells. After fixing the cells the cells were washed twice with distilled water a TRAP staining solution 0.27 mM naphthol AS MX phosphate manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. 1.6 mM fast red violet LB salt manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. 1 dimethylformamide 50 mM sodium tartrate 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 was added at 100 l well and a reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 5 minutes. After the reaction the cells were washed twice with distilled water and then observed by microscopy . As a result the formation of giant osteoclasts resulting from a high degree of cell fusion was almost completely inhibited by the addition of the 32A1 antibody. Further in the case of the 41B1 antibody the formation of giant osteoclasts resulting from a high degree of cell fusion was also significantly inhibited. On the other hand in the case of the other rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies the 1A1 antibody and others and the rat control IgG such a significant inhibition of osteoclast cell fusion was not observed. In this manner it was revealed that multinucleation and cell fusion of TRAP positive osteoclasts from normal human osteoclast precursor cells are inhibited by monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to the Siglec 15 protein.

b Effect of Addition of Rat Anti Mouse Siglec 15 Monoclonal Antibody 32A1 on Cell Fusion of Osteoclasts from Normal Human Osteoclast Precursor Cells TRAP Staining 

Normal human osteoclast precursor cells Normal Human Natural Osteoclast Precursor Cells purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. 2T 110 were seeded in a 96 well plate at 1 10cells well according to the protocol accompanying the cells. As the medium a minimal essential medium for osteoclast precursor cells OPBM purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat.

To the resulting culture supernatant the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 antibody prepared in Example 6 was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 0.3 1 or 3 g ml and the cells were cultured for 3 days in a COincubator. After the culturing the supernatant was removed and 10 neutral formalin was added to fix the cells. After fixing the cells the cells were washed twice with distilled water and a TRAP staining solution 0.27 mM naphthol AS MX phosphate manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. 1.6 mM fast red violet LB salt manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. 1 dimethylformamide 50 mM sodium tartrate 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 was added at 100 l well and a reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 5 minutes. After the reaction the cells were washed twice with distilled water and then observed by microscopy . As a result the formation of TRAP positive multinucleated osteoclasts was inhibited in a 32A1 antibody concentration dependent manner within the range of from 0.3 g ml to 3 g ml.

c Effect of Addition of Rat Anti Mouse Siglec 15 Monoclonal Antibody 32A1 on Bone Resorption Activity of Normal Human Osteoclast Precursor Cells Evaluation Using Collagen Coated Plate 

It is known that osteoclasts release a protease such as cathepsin K and degrade type I collagen which is a constitutional component of bone tissue. The OsteoLyse Assay Kit manufactured by Lonza Inc. Cat. No. PA 1500 provides a 96 well plate coated with europium conjugated human collagen 96 well OsteoLyse cell culture plate and it is possible to evaluate the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts in vitro by measuring the amount of fluorescent collagen fragments released into the supernatant when osteoclasts are cultured on the plate. Normal human osteoclast precursor cells Normal Human Natural Osteoclast Precursor Cells purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. 2T 110 were seeded in a 96 well OsteoLyse cell culture plate at 1 10cells well according to the protocol accompanying the cells. As the medium a minimal essential medium for osteoclast precursor cells OPBM purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. PT 8201 supplemented with an OPGM supplement set purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Cat. No. PT 9501 containing fetal bovine serum final concentration 10 human RANKL final concentration 68.4 ng ml human M CSF final concentration 33 ng ml and the like was used. To the resulting culture supernatant the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 antibody prepared in Example 6 was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 0.3 1 or 3 g ml and the cells were cultured for 3 days in a COincubator. A 10 l aliquot of the culture supernatant was collected and 200 l of Fluorophore Releasing Reagent included in the OsteoLyse Assay Kit was added thereto and a fluorescence intensity was measured Excitation 340 nm Emission 615 nm using a fluorescence plate reader ARVO MX manufactured by Perkin Elmer Inc. whereby the amount of free fluorescent collagen fragments released in the culture supernatant was determined . As a result the amount of fluorescent collagen fragments increased by the addition of RANKL was reduced by the 32A1 antibody in a concentration dependent manner within the range of from 0.3 g ml to 3 g ml. From this result it was revealed that the bone resorption activity of human osteoclasts is inhibited by the studied monoclonal antibody specifically binding to the Siglec 15 protein.

The ovaries on both sides were removed from female F344 rats obtained from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc. at the age of 12 weeks and the rats were divided into three groups a vehicle administration group a rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 8A1 administration group and a rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 administration group. Further one group was prepared as a sham operation group. In the antibody administration groups the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 8A1 or the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 prepared in Example 6 was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 1 mg kg three times a week repeatedly for 4 weeks from the next day of the operation. In the vehicle administration group and the sham operation group PBS containing 0.01 Tween 20 was intraperitoneally administered as the vehicle. At 4 weeks after the initiation of administration urine was collected for 24 hours under fasting conditions and the urine samples were stored at 80 C. until measurement. After completion of the urine collection the rats were euthanized and the lumbar spine was excised from each rat.

Soft tissues adhered to the excised lumbar spine were removed and the 4th to 6th lumbar vertebrae were extracted. The extracted lumbar vertebrae were degreased and dehydrated by being shaken in ethanol and then air dried and the bone mineral density was measured using a bone densitometer DCS 600EX manufactured by Aloka Co. Ltd. . The results are shown in . A significant decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density was observed in the ovariectomized group as compared with the sham operation group however in the 8A1 and 32A1 antibody administration groups a decrease in bone mineral density due to ovariectomy was significantly inhibited.

A variety of type I collagen crosslinked metabolites sharply reflect bone metabolic turnover particularly bone resorption. Above all deoxypyridinoline is localized mainly in bone collagen and therefore is considered to be highly reliable as an index of bone resorption.

The cryopreserved urine sample was thawed and insoluble matter was precipitated by a centrifugal operation whereby a supernatant was obtained. The amount of deoxypyridinoline contained in this supernatant was measured using Osteolinks DPD manufactured by DS Pharma Biomedical Co. Ltd. . Further by using Creatinine Test Wako manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. the content of creatinine in the supernatant was also measured and the amount of deoxypyridinoline corrected for creatinine was calculated. The results are shown in . The urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion was significantly increased in the ovariectomized group as compared with the sham group and therefore it was indicated that in the ovariectomized rats osteoclastic bone resorption is increased. On the other hand in the 8A1 and 32A1 antibody administration groups an increase in deoxypyridinoline excretion due to ovariectomy was inhibited such that the level of deoxypyridinoline excretion was comparable to that of the sham operation group. From this result it was also confirmed in the animal models that the studied monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to Siglec 15 inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and it was strongly indicated that due to the inhibitory effect on bone resorption a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density in the ovariectomized rats was inhibited.

The binding property of the humanized antibodies of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 32A1 T1 to T6 to mouse Siglec 15 Fc and human Siglec 15 Fc was evaluated by the following method. The mouse Siglec 15 Fc purified in Example 4 or the human Siglec 15 Fc purified in Example 12 was diluted to 1 g ml with PBS and the diluted solution was dispensed at 100 Owen onto an immunoplate manufactured by Nunc Inc. 437111 and the plate was left to stand overnight at 4 C. whereby each protein was adsorbed to the plate. On the next day each well was washed 5 times with a PBS T solution PBS 0.05 v v Tween 20 and a solution obtained by diluting skim milk manufactured by Morinaga Milk Industry Co. Ltd. to 5 with PBS was dispensed at 350 Owen and the plate was left stand at room temperature for 2 hours. The liquid in each well was removed and each well was washed 5 times with the PBS T solution. Thereafter each of the purified humanized antibodies of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 32A1 T1 to T6 prepared in Example 24 or the human chimeric antibody prepared in Example 19 was diluted to a final concentration of from 1 to 0.004 g ml 4 fold dilution series with a PBS solution containing 0.5 skim milk the diluted solution was dispensed at 100 l well and the plate was left to stand at room temperature for 2 hours. At this time the concentration of each antibody was determined by performing measurement at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer DU 7400 manufactured by Beckman Coulter Inc. and performing calculations based on a molar molecular extinction coefficient of each antibody. After each well had been washed 5 times with the PBS T solution alkaline phosphatase conjugated AffiniPure goat anti human IgG manufactured by Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. 109 055 097 diluted to 2500 fold with a TBS T solution TBS 0.05 v v Tween 20 was added at 100 l well and the plate was left to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. The liquid in each well was removed and each well was washed 5 times with the TBS T solution. Thereafter a fluorescent substrate solution manufactured by Roche Co. Ltd. 11681982001 was added at 100 l well and a fluorescence reaction was allowed to proceed. After 10 minutes from the addition of the fluorescent substrate solution in the case of the plate having the mouse Siglec 15 Fc adsorbed thereto and after 15 minutes in the case of the plate having the human Siglec 15 Fc adsorbed thereto a fluorescence intensity was measured using Spectra Max M5 manufactured by Molecular Devices Inc. . As a result it was confirmed that all of the examined six humanized antibodies of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 bind to the mouse Siglec 15 protein and the human Siglec 15 protein in an antibody concentration dependent manner.

By using the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 prepared in Example 6 and the chimeric antibody of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 prepared in Example 19 an effect on osteoclast differentiation of mouse bone marrow nonadherent cells by stimulation with TNF was examined. Mouse bone marrow nonadherent cells prepared by the method of Example 8 were prepared at 1.5 10cells ml in MEM medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 10 ng ml of M CSF and 2 ng ml of TGF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. the resulting cell preparation was seeded in each well of a 96 well plate in an amount of 200 l and the cells were cultured for 2 days in a COincubator. The old culture solution in the 96 well plate was removed and 100 l of MEM medium was added to each well the 100 l of MEM medium containing 10 FBS to which recombinant human TNF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. and M CSF had been added to give final concentrations of 30 ng ml and 10 ng ml respectively. To the cell culture solution the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 prepared in Example 6 or the chimeric antibody of the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 prepared in Example 19 was added at a concentration of from 0.125 to 4 g ml and the cells were cultured for an additional 3 days in a COincubator. At the same time a well in which the cells were cultured by adding recombinant human OCIF OPG prepared by the method described in the description of Patent Application Publication No. WO 96 26217 at a concentration of 100 ng ml was also prepared. After completion of the culturing TRAP staining was performed using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. according to the protocol accompanying the kit and the formation of TRAP positive multinucleated osteoclasts was observed. As a result the formation of TRAP positive giant multinucleated osteoclasts was inhibited by the addition of the anti mouse Siglec 15 polyclonal antibody . Although small mononuclear osteoclasts were formed even in the case where the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 32A1 or the chimeric antibody thereof was added the formation of large multinucleated osteoclasts induced by TNF was almost completely inhibited. On the other hand even when a sufficient amount of OCIF OPG which is an RANKL blocker was added the formation of large multinucleated osteoclasts was inhibited only a little. Further in the same manner the activity of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase TRAP of the formed osteoclasts was measured by the procedure described in Example 9. After stopping the enzymatic reaction an absorbance of each well at 405 nm was measured and the obtained measurement was used as an index of TRAP activity. The results are shown in . A significant inhibition of TRAP activity was observed in the case of the 32A1 antibody and the chimeric antibody of 32A1 within the range of from 125 ng ml to 4 g ml. From these results it was shown that the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody and the chimeric antibody thereof strongly inhibit the process of cell fusion in osteoclast differentiation and maturation induced by TNF .

By using the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies 8A1 and 32A1 prepared in Example 6 an effect on osteoclast differentiation of rat bone marrow nonadherent cells was examined. Rat bone marrow nonadherent cells were prepared by modifying the method of Example 8. That is the femur was excised from both legs of a female F344 rat at the age of 12 weeks and soft tissues were removed. Both ends of the femur were cut off and MEM medium was injected using a syringe with a 23 gauge injection needle to push out bone marrow cells which were collected in a centrifugal tube. Centrifugation was performed at room temperature for 5 minutes at 100 g and the supernatant was removed. To the resulting cell pellet 1 ml of a hemolytic buffer Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer manufactured by Sigma Co. Ltd. was added to suspend it and the resulting suspension was left at room temperature for 5 minutes. 20 ml of D PBS was added thereto the suspension was centrifuged at room temperature for 5 minutes at 100 g and the supernatant was removed. To the resulting cell pellet 10 ml of MEM medium manufactured by Invitrogen Inc. containing 5 ng ml of M CSF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. and 10 fetal bovine serum FBS was added to suspend it. Then the resulting suspension was passed through a cell strainer 40 m Nylon manufactured by BD Falcon to remove aggregates. The resulting cells were transferred to a 75 cmT flask for the attachment of adherent cells and cultured overnight in a COincubator. After the overnight culture the cells which did not adhere to the T flask were recovered and used as rat bone marrow nonadherent cells.

The rat bone marrow nonadherent cells prepared by this method were cultured and a test for rat osteoclast formation was performed according to the method of Example 9. That is the thus prepared rat bone marrow nonadherent cells were prepared at 1.5 10cells ml in MEM medium containing 10 FBS and 10 ng ml of M CSF manufactured by R D Systems Inc. and the resulting cell preparation was seeded in each well of a 96 well plate in an amount of 200 l and the cells were cultured for 2 days in a COincubator. The old culture solution in the 96 well plate was removed and 100 l of MEM medium was added to each well the 100 l of MEM medium containing 10 FBS to which human RANKL RANKL manufactured by Peprotech Inc. and M CSF had been added to give final concentrations of 20 ng ml and 10 ng ml respectively. To the cell culture solution the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibody 8A1 or 32A1 produced in Example 6 was added at a concentration of from 31 to 1000 ng ml and the cells were cultured for an additional 3 days in a COincubator. After completion of the culturing the activity of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase TRAP of the formed osteoclasts was measured by the method described in Example 9. After stopping the enzymatic reaction an absorbance of each well at 405 nm was measured and the obtained measurement was used as an index of TRAP activity. The results are shown in . In the case of the 8A1 antibody a dose dependent inhibition of TRAP activity was observed at a concentration of 63 ng ml or higher and in the case of the 32A1 antibody a dose dependent inhibition of TRAP activity was observed at a concentration of 31 ng ml or higher. From these results it was shown that the rat anti mouse Siglec 15 monoclonal antibodies 8A1 and 32A1 strongly inhibit the rat osteoclast formation in the same manner as the mouse osteoclast formation and the in vitro activity of inhibiting rat osteoclast formation of the 32A1 antibody is higher than that of 8A1 antibody.

A humanized 32A1 antibody was constructed according to a method generally known as CDR grafting Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 10029 10033 1989 . As for the definitions of CDR regions the Kabat definitions SEQUENCES OF PROTEINS OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST VOL. I FIFTH EDITION 1991 were used for all except for CDRH2. As for CDRH2 the sequence thereof was made shorter by five residues at the C terminus than the Kabat definition using a definition of its own. In the heavy chain sequence containing the thus defined CDRH2 the CDR sequence derived from a rat is made shorter and more of a human framework sequence is incorporated and therefore when it is administered to humans it is much less likely to be recognized as a heterologous antigen. An acceptor antibody was selected based on the amino acid homology within the framework region. The sequence of the framework region of 32A1 was compared with the sequences of all human frameworks in the Kabat Database Nuc. Acid Res. 29 205 206 2001 involving antibody amino acid sequences. As a result for the L chain GF4 1.1 CL was selected as an acceptor based on a sequence homology of 71 in the framework region. As for the H chain M37GO37 CL was selected as an acceptor based on a sequence homology of 73 in the framework region. In respect of the L chain the amino acid residues in the framework region of GF4 1.1 CL and in respect of the H chain the amino acid residues in the framework region of M37GO37 CL were aligned with the amino acid residues of 32A1 and the positions where different amino acids were used were identified. The positions of these residues were analyzed using the three dimensional model of 32A1 constructed in a i of Example 22. Then donor residues to be grafted on the acceptor were selected according to the criteria provided by Queen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 10029 10033 1989 . By transferring some selected donor residues to the acceptor antibody humanized 32A1 sequences were constructed as described in the following Examples.
