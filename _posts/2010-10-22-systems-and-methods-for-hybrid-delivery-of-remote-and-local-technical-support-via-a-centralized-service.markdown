No. 12 198 713 Systems and Methods for Hybrid Delivery of Remote and Local Technical Support Via a Centralized Service filed Aug. 26 2008 which is a Continuation In Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 169 706 Systems and Methods for Distributing Remote Technical Support via a Centralized Service filed Jul. 9 2008 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 949 676 Systems and Methods for Distributing Remote Technical Support Via a Centralized Service filed Jul. 13 2007.

The present application is generally directed to centralized technical support management services. In particular the present application relates to providing onsite as well as remote technical support coordinated by a centralized service.

One way to provide support and repair of computers and electronics of consumers is through on site services. On site support services may be delivered via technical labor visiting the home to solve problems provision of information to the home in the form of emails online chat and phone or remotely attaching to the devices and providing direct support. The delivery of labor to the home is immensely inefficient and expensive because of travel time and because the nature of the work is indeterminate. Resolving a problem in the home may require a short visit or a long visit and may not be known until the technical labor is on site. As a result in home service providers typically schedule the availability of technicians with slack time to account for the indeterminate nature of the work as well as travel. The use of slack time to account for the nature of the work is wasteful and increases the amount of additional labor that may needed as demand increases. Not using slack time or using less slack time may decrease the availability of technicians to handle the next customer. This may result in abandoned customers decreased response time and decrease customer satisfaction. The nature of the on site work may be broad in technical scope as it may involve many different devices and software. This makes it very difficult if not nearly impossible for a service provider to find someone who is able to address the full spectrum of work on site. Often times follow up visits must be scheduled to complete work which could not be resolved by the dispatched technician. This results in longer delays in resolving the issue at home decreasing the customer s satisfaction with the support experience.

On the other hand purely remote service cannot resolve problems when access to the computer or other devices is constrained due to malfunction network issues or connections. Further there may be a hardware issue which requires a physical presence to repair or replace in order to fix. Therefore it is challenging to provide an optimum customer service experience by using either onsite support or remote customer support.

The solution described herein provides an innovative use of remote services technology integrated with service personnel onsite at the point of service such as a consumer repair outlet to provide a pool of technical support resources to service a widely distributed resource need such as support and repair resource needs of a chain of consumer outlets or an aggregated group of single proprietor consumer outlets. With this solution qualified technical resources are provided from a central location to service a wide variety of environments. This is on demand online remote support service is called or referred to as support from a spigot. The distribution method enables the delivery of higher quality more reliable and overall lower cost services. Instead of requiring dedicated technical resources at each location lower skilled labor may be deployed at the location to enable the remote technical support services process.

The present solution breaks down a request for technical support into sub domains of onsite and remote support which can be delivered by different skill types and methods. Amount of onsite labor time is optimized thereby allowing an efficient use of onsite labor. The skill set for onsite labor is more limited and hence amenable to more focused development. A resource pool is managed via a centralized service to support information flow in the hybrid labor model. The centralized service tracks service information and results.

The pool of remote technical resources is aggregated using centralized technology. Tools such as managed desktop sharing software with queuing software phone automated call distribution systems ACD and enabling processes may used to aggregate the remote resources via a central point. Onsite personnel may enable the work via the centralized service. Once enabled the pool of remote technical resources may deliver a broad range of services in the consumer outlet including installation of software repair of software based problems and general diagnostics. Because of the unique distribution model the technical resources may work from any geographical location.

The centralized resource pool may be staffed to meet time of day demands peak seasonal demands and even short bursts of demand at a much higher efficiency level than the traditional model. Work loads are statistically easier to forecast and staff when it is pooled at a central location. The efficiency of the centralized workforce is significantly higher because work load analysis can better predict staffing requirements and the work force will benefit from a steady stream of work. The centralized management of the pool of resources also allows for a complete service support structure to be put in place to hire train and manage the specialized and or technical resources. With availability of different and highly skilled resources via a centralized service tiered escalation resources may be brought to bear on a support or repair issue without the need for travel or delay. Because of the ability to route work to specific resources and between specialized resources based upon work type the most or more appropriate and lowest or lower cost labor may applied to address problem by category or type.

The hybrid model is a unique technology enabled support service model with significant benefits over the current state of the art. The benefits include a more efficient labor model. Overall cost of support is reduced since a large part of support is provided by remote labor instead of higher cost onsite labor. Onsite labor time is minimized and efficiency of onsite labor is increased. A larger pool of better skilled and better managed resources may be used to service a wide variety of service environments. The centralized pool of resource may more easily meet temporary surges in demand for services. The right skilled remote or onsite resources may be timely assigned to a technical problem to assure lower cost and higher quality work for each problem. With this new technology enabled support service consumer outlets may provide new services and guarantees to their customers.

The Intelligent Switch provides the connection of work to a specific pool or queue of resource and the assignment and dispatching of the work to a specific available technician to perform the work. The Intelligent Switch is designed and constructed to accept input from the store associate or customer from which to determine the work required and perform the intelligent switching. In some embodiments the Intelligent Switch may use any customer call center software and solutions manufactured by Aspect Software Inc. of Irvine Calif. A CRM software system may be used to track the work that is performed so that both the personnel at the consumer outlet and the technical agent can track the work and status of the work performed on a specific device . One embodiment of the remote technical support system uses a web based custom application to track the status of services although any type of tracking or software service may be used.

In one embodiment when work is completed the computer or device at the consumer outlet is disconnected from the remote technician . For example the remote technician may log off the device or terminate the remote desktop sharing connection to the device . In another embodiment the device may be disconnected from the Internet Interface and or Internet Switch. The status of the work may be passed back to the store associate via a message left on the device itself and or via the ticketing system such as a CRM which tracks the work. In some cases the remote technician may communicate directly via phone email or chat Instant messaging with the store associate or customer. In some embodiments the ticketing system information may be used to charge the customer for work done.

The systems and methods of the centralized remote technical support services described above may also be deployed for local onsite services. In these embodiments the solution uses remote services technology to deliver the most appropriate trained technical resource to resolve the customer needs at the customer s home or location. The innovative application of the centralized technology discussed herein with innovative modification to skills and processes for local onsite service improves and optimizes the amount of cost required to deliver services to the home. Without the use of the technology and processes described herein one or more technicians visits the consumer s home or location for an indeterminate period of time and for additional appointments to be scheduled when the work exceeds either the time or the skill of the one or more technicians.

By using the systems and methods described herein the skills of the technician visiting the home may be redefined or re scoped to be associated with connecting devices and enabling connection of the computers to a network or the Internet. The amount of time to perform these tasks is more deterministic and requires a much more focused set of skills. For example an onsite service home service technician may be dispatched for hour hour or other predetermined time increments to perform a preliminary diagnostics and to setup up the service work to the Internet Switch much like the store associate in the consumer outlet scenarios described above. Once the interconnection of the consumer device is complete and the device is hooked up to the Internet Switch remote resources from the centralized service may be connected to complete all the necessary installations configurations training and repairs. As such in these embodiments appropriate skilled resources are applied without the need to send additional technicians to the consumer s location. The onsite technician may leave to attend other service calls once the device is hooked up to the Internet Switch.

A typical example scenario for a local onsite service is that a consumer may call for help because his or her computer is slow lost connectivity to the Internet experiencing lots of pop ups and or perhaps would like to install some new devices. A technician may be assigned a time frame of 1 3 hours reserved to perform the work. When the technician arrives on site he or she may diagnose the problem and may start with a set of tools to fix the problem and then proceed to hook the computer up to the Internet or verify connectivity to the Internet. Once done the technician may start to install new devices and software onto the computer. Without the use of the centralized remote technical services described herein much of the time spent on site is watching the tools fix the problems as they can take a long time to scan and automatically fix problems. In some cases the technician may run out of time or that there will be aspects of the work that will require another visit by a technician with a different set of skills. With the user of the centralized remote technical services described herein a predetermined amount of time may be set for the technician for an onsite visit such as a 1 hour appointment. In that time period the technician may perform a diagnostics and connect and configure the device to be connected to the Internet Switch and pool of remote technical resources. The onsite technician may go to another place to do the same work another home visit for a predetermined amount of time after leaving the computer connected to the centralized remote technical support service. At that point the computer may be assigned from a queue to a remote technician to perform the desired service based on the onsite technician s diagnostics description of the problem or information submitted to the Internet Switch. The remote technician for example may clean and update the software and configuration of the computer and install any new devices. In addition the remote technician may deliver training to the consumer at his home such as live one on one training. If the remote technician performing the service is not the best or appropriate resource to perform the service the connection to the consumer s computer may be transferred electronically and real time to the next appropriate technician with out the need to reschedule an onsite visit.
