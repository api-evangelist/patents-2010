This invention relates to a system and computer implemented method for authenticating a user. In particular this invention relates to remote authentication of a user.

A user accessing an on line resource is typically required to authenticate their identity by entering log in credentials typically consisting of a user credential such as a username and an associated password. The on line resource compares the credentials with its records and if there is a match authenticates the user to allow access to the on line resource.

In practice this requires the user to either remember different sets of credentials one set associated with each on line resource re use log in credentials for multiple on line resources or record the credentials and associated on line resource identifying information in a safe location.

Current methods of improving this process typically relate to a web browser of a computing device remembering a history of the user and auto populating the authentication fields when prompted by an on line resource. This approach suffers from a lack of security in that the computing device which is accessible on a network is storing the authentication where it could be accessed by an attacker if the security of the computing device were breached.

Another disadvantage of this approach is that a user still has to remember their credentials when using a different computing device that lacks the history or if the history of the device has been cleared. This may require retrieving information from each on line resource via an email account or some other means where a user has forgotten their credentials. Since the browser is auto populating the log in fields it is more likely that a user will forget their credentials.

Another disadvantage of this method is that it encourages users to maintain a static set of credentials and to use simple user credentials and associated passwords to assist their memory.

The embodiments herein of computing devices are described as including a processor. It is understood that such reference refers to at least one processor and includes multi core processors or multiple processors.

The communication subsystem receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this exemplary embodiment of the mobile communication device the communication subsystem is configured in accordance with one or more of Global System for Mobile Communication GSM General Packet Radio Services GPRS standards Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service UMTS . New standards are still being defined but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem with the wireless network represents one or more different Radio Frequency RF channels operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM GPRS EDGE or UMTS and optionally other network communications. With newer network protocols these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.

Other wireless networks can also be associated with the mobile communication device in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that can be employed include for example data centric wireless networks voice centric wireless networks and dual mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual mode networks include but are not limited to Code Division Multiple Access CDMA or CDMA2000 networks GSM GPRS networks third generation 3G networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some other examples of data centric networks include WiFi 802.11 Mobitex and DataTAC network communication systems. Examples of other voice centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems PCS networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems. The main processor also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory RAM a flash memory a display an auxiliary input output I O subsystem a data port a keyboard a speaker a microphone short range wireless communications and other device subsystems .

Some of the subsystems of the mobile communication device perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems can provide resident or on device functions. By way of example the display and the keyboard can be used for both communication related functions such as entering a text message for transmission over the network and device resident functions such as a calculator or task list.

A rendering circuit is included in the device . When a user specifies that a data file is to be viewed on the display the rendering circuit analyzes and processes the data file for visualization on the display . Rendering circuit may be implemented as hardware software or as a combination of both hardware and software.

The mobile communication device can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device . To identify a subscriber the mobile communication device requires a SIM RUIM card i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module to be inserted into a SIM RUIM interface in order to communicate with a network. The SIM RUIM card is one type of a conventional smart card that can be used to identify a subscriber of the mobile communication device and to personalize the mobile communication device among other things. Without the SIM RUIM card the mobile communication device is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM RUIM card into the SIM RUIM interface a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services can include web browsing and messaging such as e mail voice mail Short Message Service SMS and Multimedia Messaging Services MMS . More advanced services can include point of sale field service and sales force automation. The SIM RUIM card includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM RUIM card is inserted into the SIM RUIM interface it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber the SIM RUIM card can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI . An advantage of using the SIM RUIM card is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM RUIM card can store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well including datebook or calendar information and recent call information. Alternatively user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .

The mobile communication device may be a battery powered device including a battery interface for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments the battery can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which assists the battery in providing power V to the mobile communication device . Although current technology makes use of a battery future technologies such as micro fuel cells can provide the power to the mobile communication device .

The mobile communication device also includes an operating system and software components to which are described in more detail below. The operating system and the software components to that are executed by the main processor are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory which can alternatively be a read only memory ROM or similar storage element not shown . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system and the software components to such as specific device applications or parts thereof can be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art.

The subset of software applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the mobile communication device to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory of the mobile communication device or some other suitable storage element in the mobile communication device . In at least some embodiments some of the sent and received messages can be stored remotely from the device such as in a data store of an associated host system that the mobile communication device communicates with.

The software applications can further include a device state module a Personal Information Manager PIM and other suitable modules not shown . The device state module provides persistence i.e. the device state module ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory such as the flash memory so that the data is not lost when the mobile communication device is turned off or loses power.

The PIM includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user such as but not limited to e mail contacts calendar events voice mails appointments and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items can be seamlessly integrated synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the mobile device subscriber s corresponding data items stored and or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the mobile communication device with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber s office computer system.

The mobile communication device also includes a connect module and an information technology IT policy module . The connect module implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile communication device to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system such as an enterprise system that the mobile communication device is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in which are described in more detail below.

The connect module includes a set of Application Programming Interfaces APIs that can be integrated with the mobile communication device to allow the mobile communication device to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module allows the mobile communication device to establish an end to end secure authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the mobile communication device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively in some cases the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.

Other types of software applications can also be installed on the mobile communication device . These software applications can be third party applications which are added after the manufacture of the mobile communication device . Examples of third party applications include games calculators utilities etc.

The additional applications can be loaded onto the mobile communication device through at least one of the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range wireless communications subsystem or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device and can provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications can enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .

The data port enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path can for example be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication. The data port can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile communication device and another computing device. The data port can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances the data port can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery of the mobile communication device .

The short range wireless communications subsystem provides for communication between the mobile communication device and different systems or devices without the use of the wireless network . For example the subsystem can include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short range communication. Examples of short range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association IrDA Bluetooth and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.

In use a received signal such as a text message an e mail message or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the main processor . The main processor will then process the received signal for output to the display or alternatively to the auxiliary I O subsystem . A subscriber can also compose data items such as e mail messages for example using the keyboard in conjunction with the display and possibly the auxiliary I O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem can include devices such as a touchscreen mouse track ball infrared fingerprint detector or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard and or telephone type keypad. However other types of keyboards can also be used. A composed item can be transmitted over the wireless network through the communication subsystem . It will be appreciated that if the display comprises a touchscreen then the auxiliary subsystem may still comprise one or more of the devices identified above.

For voice communications the overall operation of the mobile communication device is substantially similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem can also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker the display can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

In an aspect a computing device program product may be provided for execution on the computing device the computing device program product rendering the computing device operative to carry out steps of the method. In an embodiment the computing device program product may comprise computer readable program code means embodied on a storage medium such as an optical disc hard disc or other non transitory memory.

Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which can perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection and analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission over the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter can be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The wireless link between the mobile communication device and the wireless network can contain one or more different channels typically different RF channels and associated protocols used between the mobile communication device and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that should be conserved typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the mobile communication device . When the mobile communication device is fully operational the transmitter is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly the receiver is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information if at all during designated time periods.

In a GSM network the MSC is coupled to the BSC and to a landline network such as a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU the SGSN and the GGSN to a public or private network Internet also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities the BSC also contains the Packet Control Unit PCU that connects to the SGSN to control segmentation radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the mobile communication device and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management the HLR is shared between the MSC and the SGSN . Access to the VLR is controlled by the MSC .

The station is a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a cell . The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile communication device in accordance with particular usually predetermined communication protocols and parameters under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts if necessary any communication signals received from the mobile communication device within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters can vary between different nodes. For example one node can employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.

For all communication devices registered with a specific network permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in the HLR . The HLR also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR . Further the VLR also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR to the VLR for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR node to the VLR the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.

The SGSN and the GGSN are elements added for GPRS support namely packet switched data support within GSM. The SGSN and the MSC have similar responsibilities within the wireless network by keeping track of the location of each mobile communication device . The SGSN also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network . The GGSN provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSNs via an Internet Protocol IP backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations a given mobile communication device must perform a GPRS Attach to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently all GPRS capable networks use private dynamically assigned IP addresses thus requiring the DHCP server connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service RADIUS server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete a logical connection is established from a mobile communication device through the PCU and the SGSN to an Access Point Node APN within the GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for the network insofar as each mobile communication device must be assigned to one or more APNs and communication devices cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN can be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as myconnection.wireless.com .

Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity Ipsec connections used with Virtual Private Networks VPN . These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol PDP Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts the network will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile communication device is not using its PDP Context the PDP Context can be de allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server .

The host system comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network . For instance a user s desktop computer with an accompanying cradle for the user s mobile communication device is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle for the mobile communication device can be coupled to the computer by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus USB connection for example. Other user computers are also situated on the network and each can be equipped with an accompanying cradle . The cradle facilitates the loading of information e.g. PIM data private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications from the user computer to the mobile communication device and can be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the mobile communication device for use. The information downloaded to the mobile communication device can include certificates used in the exchange of messages.

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers are typically also connected to other peripheral devices such as printers etc. which are not explicitly shown in . Furthermore only a subset of network components of the host system are shown in for ease of exposition and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in for this exemplary configuration. More generally the host system can represent a smaller part of a larger network not shown of the organization and can comprise different components and or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the exemplary embodiment of .

To facilitate the operation of the mobile communication device and the wireless communication of messages and message related data between the mobile communication device and components of the host system a number of wireless communication support components can be provided. In some implementations the wireless communication support components can include a message management server a mobile data server a web server such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP server a contact server and a device manager module . HTTP servers can also be located outside the enterprise system as indicated by the HTTP server attached to the network . The device manager module includes an IT Policy editor and an IT user property editor as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the communication devices . In an alternative embodiment there can be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor and the IT user property editor . The support components also include a data store and an IT policy server . The IT policy server includes a processor a network interface and a memory unit . The processor controls the operation of the IT policy server and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below. The network interface allows the IT policy server to communicate with the various components of the host system and the communication devices . The memory unit can store functions used in implementing the IT policy as well as related data. Those skilled in the art know how to implement these various components. Other components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art. Further in some implementations the data store can be part of any one of the servers.

In this exemplary embodiment the mobile communication device communicates with the host system through node of the wireless network and a shared network infrastructure such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system can be provided through one or more routers not shown and computing devices of the host system can operate from behind a firewall or proxy server . The proxy server provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system . The proxy server intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system .

In some implementations the host system can include a wireless VPN router not shown to facilitate data exchange between the host system and the mobile communication device . The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the mobile communication device . The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol IP Version 6 IPV6 and IP based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off the shelf VPN component and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection can preferably be a Transmission Control Protocol TCP IP or User Datagram Protocol UDP IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the mobile communication device in this alternative implementation.

Messages intended for a user of the mobile communication device are initially received by a message server of the host system . Such messages can originate from any number of sources. For instance a message can have been sent by a sender from the computer within the host system from a different mobile device not shown connected to the wireless network or a different wireless network or from a different computing device or other device capable of sending messages via the shared network infrastructure possibly through an application service provider ASP or Internet service provider ISP for example.

The message server typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages particularly e mail messages within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure . Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server . Some exemplary implementations of the message server include a Microsoft Exchange server a Lotus Domino server a Novell Groupwise server or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations the host system can comprise multiple message servers . The message server can also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists for example.

When messages are received by the message server they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server . In at least some embodiments the data store can be a separate hardware unit such as data store with which the message server communicates. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server . For instance an e mail client application operating on a user s computer can request the e mail messages associated with that user s account stored on the data store associated with the message server . These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer . The data store associated with the message server can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the mobile communication device . Alternatively the data store associated with the message server can store all of the messages for the user of the mobile communication device and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the mobile communication device to conserve memory. For instance the most recent messages i.e. those received in the past two to three months for example can be stored on the mobile communication device .

When operating the mobile communication device the user may wish to have e mail messages retrieved for delivery to the mobile communication device . The message application operating on the mobile communication device can also request messages associated with the user s account from the message server . The message application can be configured either by the user or by an administrator possibly in accordance with an organization s IT policy to make this request at the direction of the user at some pre defined time interval or upon the occurrence of some pre defined event. In some implementations the mobile communication device is assigned its own e mail address and messages addressed specifically to the mobile communication device are automatically redirected to the mobile communication device as they are received by the message server .

The message management server can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages such as e mail messages that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally while messages are still stored on the message server the message management server can be used to control when if and how messages are sent to the mobile communication device . The message management server also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the mobile communication device which are sent to the message server for subsequent delivery.

For example the message management server can monitor the user s mailbox e.g. the message store associated with the user s account on the message server for new e mail messages and apply user definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user s mobile communication device . The message management server can also through an encoder not shown associated therewith compress message data using any suitable compression decompression technology e.g. YK compression JPEG MPEG x H.26x and other known techniques and encrypt messages e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard DES Triple DES or Advanced Encryption Standard AES and push them to the mobile communication device via the shared network infrastructure and the wireless network . The message management server can also receive messages composed on the mobile communication device e.g. encrypted using Triple DES decrypt and decompress the composed messages re format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user s computer and re route the composed messages to the message server for delivery.

Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and or received by the mobile communication device can be defined e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy and enforced by the message management server . These may include whether the mobile communication device can receive encrypted and or signed messages minimum encryption key sizes whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and or signed and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the mobile communication device are to be sent to a pre defined copy address for example.

The message management server can also be adapted to provide other control functions such as only pushing certain message information or pre defined portions e.g. blocks of a message stored on the message server to the mobile communication device . For example in some cases when a message is initially retrieved by the mobile communication device from the message server the message management server can push only the first part of a message to the mobile communication device with the part being of a pre defined size e.g. 2 KB . The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar sized blocks by the message management server to the mobile communication device possibly up to a maximum pre defined message size. Accordingly the message management server facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the mobile communication device and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.

The mobile data server encompasses any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server can include but is not limited to databases online data document repositories customer relationship management CRM systems or enterprise resource planning ERP applications. The mobile data server can also connect to the Internet or other public network through HTTP server or other suitable web server such as an File Transfer Protocol FTP server to retrieve HTTP webpages and other data. Requests for webpages are typically routed through mobile data server and then to HTTP server through suitable firewalls and other protective mechanisms. The web server then retrieves the webpage over the Internet and returns it to mobile data server . As described above in relation to message management server mobile data server is typically provided or associated with an encoder that permits retrieved data such as retrieved webpages to be decompressed and compressed using any suitable compression technology e.g. YK compression JPEG MPEG x H.26x and other known techniques and encrypted e.g. using an encryption technique such as DES Triple DES or AES and then pushed to the mobile communication device via the shared network infrastructure and the wireless network . While encoder is only shown for mobile data server it will be appreciated that each of message server message management server and HTTP servers and can also have an encoder associated therewith.

The contact server can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the mobile communication device . Accordingly for a given contact the contact server can include the name phone number work address and e mail address of the contact among other information. The contact server can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system .

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server the mobile data server the HTTP server the contact server the device manager module the data store and the IT policy server do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system . For example some or all of the functions associated with the message management server can be integrated with the message server or some other server in the host system . Alternatively the host system can comprise multiple message management servers particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.

The device manager module provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the communication devices . As mentioned the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the mobile communication device that are permitted such as phone web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the communication devices such as auto signature text WLAN VoIP VPN configuration security requirements e.g. encryption algorithms password rules etc. specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the mobile communication device and the like.

Rendering data files originally optimized or prepared for visualization on large screen displays on a portable electronic device display often requires additional processing prior to visualization on the small screen portable electronic device displays. According to an embodiment this additional processing is accomplished by the rendering engine shown in . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the rendering engine can be implemented in hardware software or a combination thereof and can comprise a dedicated image processor and associated circuitry or can be implemented within main processor .

Referring to there is an exemplary embodiment comprising a computing device connected to a public or private network such as the Internet . Computing device could be a computer which a user is utilising to navigate the Internet to access an on line resource for instance through a web browser. In a typical embodiment processor will communicate with RAM and non transitory storage memory to execute a software program product such as a web browser to enable computing device to communicate with the Internet and access a server hosting the on line resource such as web server connected to the Internet through a network communication subsystem .

Computing device further comprises a user input interface such as a keyboard mouse or touch screen for receiving input from a user a network communication subsystem for communications between the communication device and the Internet and a short range communications subsystem for short range communications with other computing devices. In an embodiment the short range communications subsystem may comprise a wireless short range communications means such as Bluetooth or Infrared. In an alternate embodiment the short range communications subsystem may comprise a data port for physical connection to another computing device for instance through a USB connection.

The web server may receive an on line resource request for content from the computing device and enabled by program code executing on the web server processor in communication with web server RAM and web server storage memory will access content stored in web server storage memory or a connected memory archive and deliver the content to the computing device .

In applications where the content is an authentication portal for authenticating the user before delivering content intended for the user or re directing the user to another on line resource the first content delivered to the computing device may comprise a user authentication portal. A user authentication portal may be presented as a web page that receives on line resource log in credentials comprising a credential input field for the user to enter an on line resource user credential and a password input field for the user to enter an associated on line resource user password that is associated with the user s credential. As is known a user authentication portal may present some other input means capable of receiving the on line resource user credential and the associated on line resource user password from the user. Typically a user will enter the on line resource user credential and the associated on line resource user password by inputting data through the user input interface for instance a keyboard or touchscreen associated with the computing device .

According to an embodiment an on line authentication method may be employed wherein the computing device utilises the mobile communications device to assist in obtaining the user s on line resource log in credentials associated with a particular on line resource. In an embodiment the web browser operating on the computing device includes program code to render the web browser operative to utilise the mobile communications device for authentication. In both embodiments authentication credentials consisting of an authentication user credential and an associated authentication user password are transmitted by the computing device optionally along with an on line resource identifier associated with the on line resource being accessed to an authentication server .

As will be appreciated the program code could either comprise a component of the web browser including a plug in or extension or the program code may comprise a separate program that receives content and requests from the web browser. For the embodiment where the web browser is so enabled the web browser will accept authentication credentials comprising an authentication user credential and an associated authentication user password from the user.

The computing device transmits the authentication credentials comprising the authentication user credential and the associated authentication user password and optionally an on line resource identifier via the network communication subsystem over the Internet to an authentication server through the authentication server communication subsystem . The authentication server is enabled by program code executing on at least one authentication server processor in communication with authentication server RAM and authentication server storage memory . Alternatively the authentication server may comprise a server within the host system or a server external to the host system such as a service provider s server supplied and maintained by a service provider such as a device manufacturer or a telecommunications company that is providing access to the wireless network .

For the purposes of this description the authentication server will be described as being within the host system and in communication with the wireless network and the Internet through the network communication subsystem . In an embodiment network communication subsystem may provide communication with the Internet and a wireless communication subsystem may provide for communication with the nodes of the wireless network for instance over a private network. Alternatively other subsystems within the host system such as proxy server may direct communications.

In an embodiment the computing device transmits the on line resource identifier to the authentication server based upon an on line resource address input or selected by the user. In an alternate embodiment the computing device may transmit the on line resource identifier to the authentication server based upon the content received from the web server . In an alternate embodiment the computing device may transmit the on line resource identifier to the authentication server in response to additional user input. The additional user input may comprise an input selection made by the user instructing the device to transmit the on line resource identifier to the authentication server . Alternatively the additional user input may comprise the authentication credentials entered by the user into the credential input field. The authentication credentials may comprise a credential identifier associated with the authentication server that may be identified by the computing device as being authentication credentials for forwarding to the authentication server . In an embodiment the credential identifier may comprise a pre defined alphanumeric prefix that may be appended to a random string to comprise the authentication user credential or associated password. The computing device may identify a credential input by a user as being an authentication user credential by matching the specified characters of the input credential with the prefix.

The computing device may transmit the associated authentication user password based upon input from the user or based upon a stored authentication password associated with the on line resource and authentication user credential. Preferably the stored authentication password is maintained in a secure storage on the computing device for instance in encrypted form. While storing passwords in association with an authentication user credential may lead to security weaknesses the present system and method provides additional safe guards to protect a user.

The computing device may also transmit a computing device identifier or a user identifier to the authentication server . Preferably the transmission to the authentication server is encrypted.

The authentication server receives the authentication log in credentials comprising the authentication user credential the associated authentication user password and optionally the on line resource identifier the computing device identifier or the user identifier preferably in encrypted form. After decryption the authentication server compares the received information with information maintained in a user store such as store accessible to the authentication server . The authentication server compares the authentication user credential the associated authentication user password and the on line resource identifier to locate the on line resource user credential and the on line resource user password stored for the user in association with the identified on line resource. If a valid match is made as a result of the comparison the authentication server transmits a decryption certificate preferably securely to the computing device for use in association with the on line resource.

The authentication server also in one embodiment transmits preferably in encrypted form an authentication comprising on line resource log in credentials comprising the on line resource user credential and the on line resource user password stored for the user identified by the authentication credentials in association with the identified on line resource over the wireless network to the mobile computing device . The authentication server may also transmit instructions to the mobile computing device associated with the log in credentials.

The mobile computing device receives and processes the authentication comprising the preferably encrypted on line resource log in credentials and optionally the associated instructions. In a preferred embodiment the instructions include an instruction to authenticate the mobile computing device with the computing device employing short range communication module . The authentication may comprise a standard authentication mechanism known to the person skilled in the art. The short range communication module is used for the authentication to ensure the computing device is within near proximity to the mobile computing device . After authentication the mobile computing device may transmit using short range communication module the encrypted log in credentials to the authenticated computing device .

In an embodiment the mobile computing device may maintain on line resource log in credentials within a secure store on the device . In this alternate embodiment the authentication server may transmit as an authentication preferably in encrypted form the on line resource identifier and encryption security information to the mobile communications device . The encryption security information being associated with the decryption security information sent from the authentication server in response to the request. Information encrypted using the encryption security information may be decrypted using the decryption security information. In an embodiment the on line resource identifier may comprise a hash of the log in credentials maintained within the secure store of the device .

The mobile communications device may then access the log in credentials associated with the on line resource identifier from the secure store and process the corresponding credentials using the encryption security information supplied by the authentication server to generate a processed authentication comprising encrypted on line resource log in credentials. The mobile communications device may then authenticate with the computing device as described above and transmit the processed authentication including the encrypted log in credentials to the computing device .

In an embodiment where the device maintains the log in credentials in encrypted form the processing may comprise decrypting the log in credentials from a first encrypted form and encrypting the decrypted log in credentials using the encryption security information into a second encrypted form to comprise the processed authentication.

In both embodiments the authenticated computing device may process the processed authentication received from the mobile communications device to decrypt the encrypted log in credentials using the decryption security information sent to the computing device from the authentication server and submit the log in credentials to the on line resource in place of the user credential and the associated user password actually entered by the user into the computing device .

In such a fashion a user entering log in credentials through user input may enter information unrelated to the log in credentials required by an on line resource. For instance a user may enter a single set of log in credentials for multiple on line resources but the computing device will actually authenticate the user with each on line resource using a unique set of log in credentials.

Referring to computing device may be operative to receive a request for on line content from a user in step . As indicated above the user request may comprise the user navigating to an on line resource available on web server and the web server delivering an authentication portal to the computing device .

As indicated above the computing device may forward authentication log in credentials to the authentication server to identify the user. The computing device may receive a processed authentication from a mobile device over short range communications in step . The computing device may forward the processed authentication to the on line resource for access in step .

In an alternate embodiment illustrated in the computing device may carry out steps and as described above. After forwarding the request to the authentication server however the computing device may receive both a processed authentication through short range communications in step and decryption security information from the authentication server over the network in step . The computing device may use the decryption security information to process the processed authentication to obtain a user credential and an associated password for the on line resource in step . In an aspect the computing device may process the processed authentication by decrypting the processed authentication using the decryption security information. The computing device may then forward the user credential and the associated password to the on line resource for access in step .

As described above the authentication forwarded in step may comprise encrypted log in credentials for the on line resource or may comprise an identifier such as a hash to identify log in credentials stored on a secure store of the mobile device .

In an embodiment after step but before steps and the authentication server may further generate an encryption key and a decryption key the decryption key comprising the decryption security information forwarded over the network in step . The encryption key may comprise encryption security information included with the authentication forwarded in step where log in credentials are stored on the mobile device . Alternatively the encryption key may be used by the authentication server to encrypt log in credentials resident on the authentication server such that the encrypted log in credentials comprise the authentication.

Referring to the mobile device may be operative to receive an authentication over a wireless network in step . The device may process the authentication in step . The mobile device may forward a processed authentication over a short range communications system such as Bluetooth to a computing device in step .

Referring to in an embodiment the mobile device may store log in credentials on a secure store of the mobile device and the authentication may comprise an identifier to identify stored log in credentials that correspond to the current on line resource request. Accordingly in the embodiment the authentication processing step may comprise the mobile device obtaining stored log in credentials. In the embodiment the mobile device may process the authentication to obtain the identifier and encryption security information in step . The mobile device may locate stored log in credentials comprising a stored user credential and associated password that correspond to the identifier in step . The mobile device may encrypt the located log credentials using the encryption security information to create the processed authentication in step . As above the mobile device may forward the processed authentication in this embodiment comprising the encrypted log in credentials over the short range communications subsystem to computing device in step .

Referring to in an embodiment the authentication may comprise instructions for execution by the mobile device . Accordingly in the embodiment the authentication processing step may comprise the mobile device processing the authentication to obtain the instructions and execute the instructions. In the embodiment illustrated the mobile device may process the authentication to obtain instructions and encrypted log in credentials in step . The encrypted log in credentials comprising a processed authentication for subsequent forwarding to the computing device . Alternatively the authentication may comprise instructions and an identifier for locating credentials stored on the mobile device as illustrated in . The mobile device may execute the instructions for instance to request specified user input in step . The mobile device may determine whether it has received the specified input in a specified form in step . The specified form may comprise temporal limitations or specific input requirements. If the mobile device determines that it has not received the specified input in step the mobile device may terminate the authentication processing and optionally return an error in step . The error may be returned to either the authentication server over the wireless network or to the computing device over the short range communications subsystem or both. If the mobile device determines that it has received the specified input in step the mobile device may forward the processed authentication comprising encrypted log in credentials over the short range communications subsystem to the computing device in step .

In an embodiment the computing device may be operative to automatically open multiple on line resources in response to the user entering the single set of log in credentials into an on line resource from a set of trigger on line resources as identified in a set of preferences recorded on the computing device for the user.

In an alternate embodiment the set of preferences may be recorded on the authentication server or the device . In response to a master credential being input into the credential field of an on line resource the computing device is operative to forward the master credential to the authentication server as described above. Upon receiving the master credential the authentication server may be operative to identify preferences associated with the master credential and forward instructions to the device . The device may receive the instructions from the authentication server and contact the computing device using the short range communications module to spawn the on line resources specified by the preferences stored on the authentication server . Where the preferences are stored on mobile device the device may be operative to identify preferences associated with instructions sent by the authentication server and access log in credentials stored on the device to forward to the computing device . The device may forward at least one set of log in credentials to the computing device to allow the user to access the spawned on line resources. In an embodiment each on line resource is accessed using a unique set of log in credentials.

Furthermore the system may also monitor the user credential and associated user password to ensure that they meet a specified security policy. An exemplar security policy would be a unique user credential and associated user password combination for each on line resource. An alternate exemplar security policy would be to require a minimum number of characters for each of the user credential and associated user password. In an embodiment a specific variation of characters may be required including capital letters numbers and symbols for instance. In an embodiment the authentication server may assign a random user credential and a random associated user password each meeting a specified strength of number of letters and type of characters to each on line resource.

Log in credentials for an on line resource may be entered through a variety of operations. In an embodiment the computing device may include the operability for a user to set a user credential and associated password for an on line resource such as web server . In the embodiment the computing device may be operative to present a user with an option to register with an on line resource. In response to the user selecting the option to register with the on line resource the computing device may forward the on line resource identifier to the authentication server to carry out registration with the on line resource on behalf of the user. In an aspect the computing device may collect on line resource specific authentication log in credentials from the user.

In an alternate embodiment the on line resource may be operative to register the user with the authentication server directly. In the embodiment a user would navigate to an on line resource using the computing device and select registration for that resource. In response the on line resource would send a registration portal to the computing device . The user may enter a user credential associated password and an authentication server identifier into the registration portal. In an embodiment the authentication server identifier may comprise a phone number or PIN associated with the mobile device . The on line resource collects the entered information identifies an associated authentication server from the authentication server identifier and forwards a registration request to the authentication server .

In an embodiment the authentication server may forward a registration notification to a mobile communications device associated with the user requesting registration. The registration notification may require further user input into the mobile device . Upon receiving the input the mobile device may forward a confirmation to the authentication server to proceed with registration.

In a further embodiment the authentication server may present a registration portal for registering with one or more on line resources that are operative to interact with the authentication server . A user may connect to the registration portal using computing device for instance by navigating to the registration portal using an Internet browser and register for the on line resources. The registration process may include the user providing additional personal information or on line resource specific information. For instance in registering with a financial institution on line the user may supply a financial institution account number password or PIN to identify the user as a customer of the financial institution. The authentication server in response to the user registering for the on line resources may contact the on line resources to register log in credentials for the user. Depending upon the requirements of the on line resource the authentication server may further supply the personal information provided by the user for that on line resource.

The authentication server may monitor the status of the credentials and either require a user to generate a new set of credentials after a prescribed period of time or automatically generate and authenticate a new set of credentials with the on line resource without further user intervention. In an embodiment the authentication server may refresh the log in credentials based upon a security level of the device .

In this way the authentication server may ensure that a user s on line credentials meet a minimum strength and variability requirement and update those credentials as specified. Since the user is only required to remember the credentials that will be transmitted to the authentication server there is less risk that a user will write down or record their credentials in an unsecure location. Furthermore even if a user did write down their credentials in an unsecure location a third party would need access to the mobile communications device in order to access the on line resource.

As indicated above storing the password to be sent to the authentication server on computing device is less of a security risk than storing passwords to the on line resource as an attacker would still need access to the mobile computing device to receive the log in credentials for a particular website.

Having described a general embodiment more specific exemplar embodiments will be described in more detail below.

Mobile computing device may be used to account for latency in the communications by requiring user input to the device within a pre determined period of time after the device gives the user an indication such as a tone or vibration. In an embodiment the device may require a level of user input depending upon instructions sent by the authentication server . Preferably the level of user input matches a security level of the on line resource being accessed. Typical user inputs would include a physical input from the user such as a key stroke within a pre set period of time 

In an embodiment the computing device may notify a user through vibratory tone or visual means that it is ready to receive an input. In a preferred arrangement the notification may vary with the level of user input required by the mobile computing device . In an embodiment the authentication server will instruct the mobile computing device to obtain a pre determined input from the user such as a mobile device credential before authenticating the computing device . The authentication server may instruct the mobile device by including instructions with the authentication sent by the authentication server to the mobile device over the wireless network.

In this way an on line resource may be further secured by requiring two types of information from a user. On line resource credentials typically entered through user input interface of a computing device accessing a network such as the Internet and a mobile device credential which is manually entered into the device by the user. In this way a security policy of the authentication server may be imposed on the log in credentials used to access an on line resource such as a unique credential and password for each on line resource but a user is only required to remember two sets of credentials the mobile device credential and the authentication credentials. Furthermore the mobile device credential is resident on and tested by the mobile device reducing the risk of an attacker breaking the security.

In an embodiment of the authentication server a user may be able to trigger a regeneration of on line resource credentials by accessing the authentication server directly. In an embodiment the user may access the authentication server from computing device through a web portal that authenticates the user. In a preferred embodiment the authentication server log in credentials are different from the credentials entered by the user to access other on line resources.

Preferably authentication server is operative to receive the trigger to regenerate on line resource credentials process the request to generate on line resource credentials for one or more on line resources and communicate directly with the on line resource such as web server to update the user s credentials with the on line resource. In this fashion a user may browse to a single location the authentication server to refresh their on line credentials.

In an exemplary situation a user may employ a temporary public computing device such as a computer in a cyber caf or other public location to access various on line resources. After concluding their computing session the user can access the authentication server to regenerate their on line credentials to secure access to any websites they visited from the cyber caf . In a first preferred arrangement the user may access the authentication server through an authentication portal accessible from the public computing device .

In an alternate preferred arrangement mobile computing device is operative to receive a request from the user to regenerate one or more of their on line credentials and the mobile computing device may process the request to forward a message to the authentication server using the wireless network . The authentication server receiving the message from the mobile computing device may process the message to trigger the regeneration of one or more on line resource credentials.

In situations where a user does not have their mobile computing device with them when attempting to access an on line resource an alternate process may be provided. In an exemplary embodiment authentication server is operative to receive a log in credential request from a user accessing the Internet from computing device . In response to the log in credential request the authentication server may in a first embodiment transmit the log in credentials to the user for display by the computing device . Preferably communications between computing device and authentication server are secured through encryption. The user may then read the credentials from the screen and enter them directly into the authentication portal of the on line resource.

In a second exemplary embodiment the computing device may be enabled for instance by a plug in for a web browser executable on the computing device to receive the credentials from the authentication server and auto populate the authentication portal with the credentials. As above preferably the communications between the computing device and the authentication server are encrypted.

In an aspect in response to a request for access without mobile device the authentication server may forward additional security questions to the computing device for response by the user. In an aspect in response to a request for access without mobile device the authentication server may refresh the user credentials and or passwords of the on line resource being accessed after the current session has completed.

In an aspect in response to a request for access without mobile device the authentication server may forward a notification to the mobile device to alert the user that a request for access without the mobile device has been submitted. In an embodiment the authentication server may further be operative to receive a notification response from the device within a specified time period. If the authentication server receives the notification response from the device within the specified time period the authentication server denies the request for access.

Where computing device is a public computer the authentication server may in an embodiment prompt the user for a request to trigger the regeneration of the on line resource log in credentials after the on line resource session has concluded. The authentication server may also prompt the user for a request to trigger the regeneration of the authentication server log in credentials.

In an embodiment the regenerated authentication server log in credentials are communicated to the user by transmitting the credentials from the authentication server over the wireless network to the computing device for display to the user.

In the event that computing device is unable to access the on line resource available from web server with the supplied log in credentials the computing device may forward an error message to either mobile device over the short range communications or to the authentication server over the Internet . In this fashion the computing device may provide feedback when a received log in credential fails to access the on line resource.

In an embodiment the error message may include information about the rejected log in credentials such as a hash of the rejected log in credentials. In the former case the mobile device may request an updated log in credential from the authentication server to replace the rejected log in credential. In the latter case the authentication server may process the error message to compare the rejected log in credential with its records to determine if the rejected log in credential matches a current log in credential for the on line resource stored on the authentication server . The authentication server may forward the current log in credential to the computing device optionally using mobile device if the rejected log in credential does not match the current log in credential. If the current log in credential matches the rejected log in credential the authentication server may either refresh the log in credentials with the on line resource or return a message indicating that an error has occurred to the user through computing device or mobile device .

Various embodiments of the present invention having been thus described in detail by way of example it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the invention. The invention includes all such variations and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.
