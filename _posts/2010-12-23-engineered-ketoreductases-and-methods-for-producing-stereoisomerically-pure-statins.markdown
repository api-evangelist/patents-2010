The present application claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 11 856 696 filed Oct. 1 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 879 585 B2 and U.S. Ser. No. 60 848 951 filed on Oct. 2 2006 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to compositions and methods useful for the stereoselective reduction of hydroxy oxo esters such as 5 hydroxy 3 oxo hexanoate esters to yield stereoisomerically pure corresponding syn dihydroxy esters. More specifically the disclosure concerns non naturally occurring engineered ketoreductase enzymes having improved properties as compared to the wild type ketoreductases from which they were derived polynucleotides encoding the engineered ketoreductase enzymes host cells comprising such polynucleotides methods of using the engineered ketoreductase enzymes to synthesize a variety of stereoisomerically pure compounds and the stereoisomerically pure compounds synthesized therewith.

The Sequence Listing submitted concurrently herewith via EFS WEB under 37 C.F.R. 1.821 c and 1.821 e as a CRF having filename 376247 012.txt created on May 30 2008 and having a file size of 716 Kbytes is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Stereoisomerically pure syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate esters are key chiral intermediates for the synthesis of cholesterol lowering statins such as atorvastatin calcium sold under the brand name LIPITOR by Pfizer Inc. rosuvastatin calcium sold under the brand name CRESTOR by AstraZeneca Ltd. and pitavastatin sold in Japan under the brand name Lipalo by Kowa Company Ltd. and Nissan Chemical Industries . While various methods for producing these chiral intermediates are known including both chemical and enzymatic methods of reducing the corresponding 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester these methods suffer significant drawbacks making them less than ideal for commercial scale synthesis. Given the importance of these key chiral intermediates in the synthesis of cholesterol lowering statins compositions and methods useful for synthesizing these compounds in a cost effective and efficient manner would be highly desirable.

As mentioned above stereoisomerically pure syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate esters according to structural formula IIa

These key chiral intermediates are typically synthesized by reducing the corresponding enantiomerically pure 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester according to structural formula Ia 

under conditions in which the syn dihydroxy ester diastereomer of structural formula IIa supra is obtained in diastereomeric excess over the corresponding anti dihydroxy ester diastereomer of structural formula IIb

The polynucleotide can include promoters and other regulatory elements useful for expression of the encoded engineered ketoreductase and can utilize codons optimized for specific desired expression systems.

In still another aspect the present disclosure provides host cells comprising the polynucleotides and or expression vectors described herein. The host cells may be which the engineered ketoreductase enzyme was derived from or they may be a different organism. The host cells can be used for the expression and isolation of the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein or alternatively they can be used in the various methods described further below.

The ketoreductase enzymes can be used to reduce hydroxy oxo ester enantiomers of structural formula Ia to their corresponding syn dihydroxys in high yield and with a high degree of stereoselectivity.

In one aspect the ketoreductase enzymes are used in purified or isolated form. In another aspect extracts from cells expressing the enzymes are used.

Thus in another aspect the present disclosure provides methods of producing a syn dihydroxy ester according to structural formula IIa 

wherein X and Rare as previously defined. The methods generally comprise selectively reducing a hydroxy oxo ester enantiomer according to structural formula Ia 

wherein X and Rare as defined for structural formula IIa using an engineered ketoreductase enzyme described herein. The method may be carried out using whole cells that express the engineered ketoreductase enzyme such as the host cells described herein extracts or lysates from such cells or purified engineered ketoreductase enzymes.

As will be appreciated by skilled artisans the reduction reaction illustrated above generally requires a cofactor which is normally NADH or NADPH and a system for regenerating the cofactor for example glucose and glucose dehydrogenase. Since cells generally provide such cofactors and cofactor regeneration systems in embodiments employing whole cells cell extracts or cell lysates the addition of such cofactors and cofactor regeneration systems may be unnecessary. In embodiments employing purified engineered ketoreductase enzyme s such cofactors and optionally such cofactor regeneration systems will typically be added to the reaction medium along with the hydroxy oxo ester substrate and the ketoreductase enzyme s . Like the engineered ketoreductase enzyme any enzyme s comprising the cofactor regeneration system can be supplied to the reaction mixture in the form of extracts or lysates of such cells or as purified enzyme s . In embodiments employing cell extracts or cell lysates the cells used to generate the extracts or lysates can be engineered to express the enzyme s comprising the cofactor regeneration systems alone or together with the engineered ketoreductase enzyme. In embodiments employing whole cells the cells can be engineered to express the enzyme s comprising the cofactor regeneration systems and the engineered ketoreductase enzyme together.

Whether carrying out the method with whole cells cell extracts or purified ketoreductase enzymes a single ketoreductase enzyme may be used or alternatively mixtures of two or more ketoreductase enzymes may be used.

The ketoreductase enzymes described herein are highly specific for the enantiomer of structural formula Ia and catalyze the above described reduction reaction in high yield and with a high degree of stereoselectivity. Depending upon the particular engineered ketoreductase enzyme used yields in the range of about 80 to 99.9 with a diastereomeric excess d.e. of 99.5 can be readily achieved. For example it has been discovered that engineered ketoreductase enzymes of the present disclosure can be used to stereoselectively reduce the 5 hydroxyoxo ester enantiomer of structural formula Ia supra to the corresponding syn dihydroxy of structural formula IIa with yields in the range of 90 to 99.9 and with a degree of stereoselectivity of 99.7 .

In many embodiments diastereoselectivities of 99.8 99.9 99.91 99.92 99.93 99.94 99.5 99.96 99.97 99.98 and even 99.99 d.e. can be achieved. Indeed as will be discussed in more detail below in connection with a crude unpurified reduction product obtained from a starting substrate that was 99 pure in the enantiomer of structural formula Ia using the engineered ketoreductase enzyme of SEQ ID NO 316 was 99.99 pure in the syn diastereomer of structural formula IIa .

Because the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein are so highly stereoselective the resultant syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa can be recovered in substantially stereochemically pure form without the need to chirally separate it from the corresponding anti or any other diastereomer. Indeed owing to the high yield and high stereoselectivity of the reaction if the hydroxy oxo ester substrate of structural formula I is substantially pure in the enantiomer of structural formula Ia the specific syn dihydroxy ester diastereomer of structural formula IIa can be recovered from the reaction medium as a substantially pure or pure diastereomer without purification.

The chiral dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa can be used as a starting material to synthesize cholesterol lowering statins including but not limited to atorvastatin rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. A key step in many of these methods is protecting the hydroxyl groups of the syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa yielding a protected syn dihydroxy ester according to structural formula IIIa 

In some embodiments the protected syn dihydroxy ester is a compound according to structural formula Va 

wherein X and Rare as previously defined for structural formula IIa and Ris selected from C1 C12 alkyl C6 C10 aryl and C7 C12 arylalkyl. In some embodiments Ris phenyl.

Owing to their stereoselectivity the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein can be used to synthesize stereoisomerically pure preparations of protected syn dihydroxy esters according to structural formula IIIa IVa and Va . The methods generally comprise enantioselectively reducing a hydroxyoxoester enantiomer according to structural formula Ia supra using an engineered ketoreductase enzyme as described herein to yield a first reaction product comprising a syn dihydroxy ester according to structural formula IIa supra and protecting the hydroxyl groups of the syn dihydroxy ester to yield the protected syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIIa . Owing to the high stereoselectivity of the engineered ketoreductase enzymes the protected syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIIa can be recovered as a substantially stereochemically pure or pure diastereomer i.e. substantially free of the corresponding anti diastereomer and any other diastereomers without chiral separation.

The syn dihydroxy esters and or protected syn dihydroxy esters can be used as reactants in known methods to synthesize cholesterol lowering statins. Exemplary synthetic routes for preparing exemplary statins are illustrated in and . Thus in another aspect the present disclosure provides methods of producing substantially stereoisomerically pure preparations of statins such as for example atorvastatin rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. The methods generally comprises i reducing a substantially enantiomerically pure hydroxy oxo ester enantiomer according to structural formula Ia 

wherein Rand X are as previously defined with an engineered ketoreductase enzyme described herein to yield a first reaction product comprising a substantially diastereomerically pure syn dihydroxy ester according to structural formula IIa 

wherein X and Rare as defined for structural formula Ia and ii thereafter using the syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa to synthesize a statin. Since the engineered ketoreductases described herein catalyze the reduction of step i with a high degree of enantioselectivity the syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa can be used to synthesize statins having a high degree of stereoisomeric purity using reactions carried out at nearly ambient temperature and without the need for chiral separations. Indeed the high degree of stereoselectivity of the reduction reaction allows preparation of statins having a d.e. that is within about 90 to 99.99 of the e.e. of the hydroxy oxo ester starting substrate readily and economically in high yield.

 Ketoreductase and KRED are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polypeptide that is capable of enantioselectively reducing the 3 oxo group of a 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester enantiomer to yield the corresponding syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester. The polypeptide typically utilizes the cofactor reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH as the reducing agent. Ketoreductases as used herein include naturally occurring wild type ketoreductases as well as non naturally occurring engineered polypeptides generated by human manipulation.

 Coding sequence refers to that portion of a nucleic acid e.g. a gene that encodes an amino acid sequence of a protein.

 Naturally occurring or wild type refers to the form found in nature. For example a naturally occurring or wild type polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence is a sequence present in an organism that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by human manipulation.

 Recombinant when used with reference to e.g. a cell nucleic acid or polypeptide refers to a material or a material corresponding to the natural or native form of the material that has been modified in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or is identical thereto but produced or derived from synthetic materials and or by manipulation using recombinant techniques. Non limiting examples include among others recombinant cells expressing genes that are not found within the native non recombinant form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise expressed at a different level.

 Percentage of sequence identity and percentage homology are used interchangeably herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides and polypeptides and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions i.e. gaps as compared to the reference sequence which does not comprise additions or deletions for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 19812 482 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 197048 443 by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman 198885 2444 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package or by visual inspection see generally F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates Inc. and John Wiley Sons Inc. 1995 Supplement Ausubel . Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms which are described in Altschul et al. 1990215 403 410 and Altschul et al. 19773389 3402 respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al supra . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 and N penalty score for mismatching residues always 

 Reference sequence refers to a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence for example a segment of a full length gene or polypeptide sequence. Generally a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid residues in length at least 25 residues in length at least 50 residues in length or the full length of the nucleic acid or polypeptide. Since two polynucleotides or polypeptides may each 1 comprise a sequence i.e. a portion of the complete sequence that is similar between the two sequences and 2 may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two sequences sequence comparisons between two or more polynucleotides or polypeptide are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.

 Comparison window refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 20 contiguous nucleotide positions or amino acids residues wherein a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides or amino acids and wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions i.e. gaps of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence which does not comprise additions or deletions for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison window can be longer than 20 contiguous residues and includes optionally 30 40 50 100 or longer windows.

 Substantial identity refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence that has at least 80 percent sequence identity at least 85 percent identity and 89 to 95 percent sequence identity more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 20 residue positions frequently over a window of at least 30 50 residues wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to a sequence that includes deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison. In specific embodiments applied to polypeptides the term substantial identity means that two polypeptide sequences when optimally aligned such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights share at least 80 percent sequence identity preferably at least 89 percent sequence identity at least 95 percent sequence identity or more e.g. 99 percent sequence identity . Preferably residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions.

 Stereoselectivity refers to the preferential formation in a chemical or enzymatic reaction of one stereoisomer over another. Stereoselectivity can be partial where the formation of one stereoisomer is favored over the other or it may be complete where only one stereoisomer is formed. When the stereoisomers are enantiomers the stereoselectivity is referred to as enantioselectivity the fraction typically reported as a percentage of one enantiomer in the sum of both. It is commonly reported in the art typically as a percentage as the enantiomeric excess calculated therefrom according to the formula major enantiomer minor enantiomer major enantiomer minor enantiomer . Where the stereoisomers are diastereoisomers the stereoselectivity is referred to as diastereoselectivity the fraction typically reported as a percentage of one diastereomer in the sum with others. In the context of the present disclosure diastereoselectivity refers to the fraction typically reported as a percentage of the hydroxy oxo ester of structural formula Ia that gets converted into the syn dihydroxy ester of structural formula IIa as opposed to the anti dihydroxy ester of formula IIb. It may also be reported typically as a percentage as the diastereomeric excess calculated therefrom according to the formula syn IIa anti IIb syn IIa anti IIb .

The present disclosure provides engineered ketoreductase KRED enzymes that are capable of enantioselectively reducing the 3 oxo group of a 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester enantiomer to produce the corresponding syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester and have at least one improved property when compared with the naturally occurring wild type KRED enzyme obtained from . As noted above the stereoisomerically pure syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate esters produced by the ketoreductase can serve as intermediates for the synthesis of several cholesterol lowering statins. Improvements in various enzyme properties can facilitate use of these engineered ketoreductases in large scale production of this intermediate compound. Any number of improvements in enzymatic properties would be useful for the described application for example enzymatic activity thermal stability and reduced cofactor requirement.

Ketoreductase enzymes having improved properties can be obtained by mutating the genetic material encoding the ketoreductase enzyme of and identifying polynucleotides that express engineered enzymes with a desired property. These non naturally occurring ketoreductases can be generated by various well known techniques such as in vitro mutagenesis or directed evolution. In some embodiments directed evolution is an attractive method for generating engineered enzymes because of the relative ease of generating mutations throughout the whole of the gene coding for the polypeptide as well as providing the ability to take previously mutated polynucleotides and subjecting them to additional cycles of mutagenesis and or recombination to obtain further improvements in a selected enzyme property. Subjecting the whole gene to mutagenesis can reduce the bias that may result from restricting the changes to a limited region of the gene. It can also enhance generation of enzymes affected in different enzyme properties since distantly spaced parts of the enzyme may play a role in various aspects of enzyme function. Mutagenesis and directed evolution techniques useful for the purposes herein are amply described in the literature Ling et al. 1997 Approaches to DNA mutagenesis an overview 254 2 157 78 Dale et al. 1996 Oligonucleotide directed random mutagenesis using the phosphorothioate method 57 369 74 Smith 1985 In vitro mutagenesis 19 423 462 Botstein et al. 1985 Strategies and applications of in vitro mutagenesis 229 1193 1201 Carter 1986 Site directed mutagenesis 237 1 7 Kramer et al. 1984 Point Mismatch Repair 38 879 887 Wells et al. 1985 Cassette mutagenesis an efficient method for generation of multiple mutations at defined sites 34 315 323 Minshull et al. 1999 Protein evolution by molecular breeding 3 284 290 Christians et al. 1999 Directed evolution of thymidine kinase for AZT phosphorylation using DNA family shuffling 17 259 264 Crameri et al. 1998 DNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution 391 288 291 Crameri et al. 1997 Molecular evolution of an arsenate detoxification pathway by DNA shuffling 15 436 438 Zhang et al. 1997 Directed evolution of an effective fructosidase from a galactosidase by DNA shuffling and screening 94 45 4 4509 Crameri et al. 1996 Improved green fluorescent protein by molecular evolution using DNA shuffling 14 315 319 Stemmer 1994 Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling 370 389 391 Stemmer 1994 DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly In vitro recombination for molecular evolution 91 10747 10751 WO 95 22625 WO 97 0078 WO 97 35966 WO 98 27230 WO 00 42651 WO 01 75767 and U.S. Pat.

The naturally occurring polynucleotide encoding the naturally occurring ketoreductase of can be obtained from the isolated polynucleotide known to encode the ketoreductase activity Genbank accession no. NP010159 GI 6320079 . Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding the naturally occurring ketoreductases can be synthesized by polynucleotide synthesis methodologies known in the art based on the reported polynucleotide sequence of the ketoreductase encoding gene. In various embodiments as further described below the naturally occurring polynucleotide encoding the ketoreductase can be codon optimized to the codons preferred by a specific host cell used for expression of the enzyme. See e.g. Example 1.

The parent or reference polynucleotide encoding the naturally occurring or wild type ketoreductase is subjected to mutagenic processes for example random mutagenesis and recombination to introduce mutations into the polynucleotide. The mutated polynucleotide is expressed and translated thereby generating engineered ketoreductase enzymes with modifications to the polypeptide. As used herein modifications include amino acid substitutions deletions and insertions. Any one or a combination of modifications can be introduced into the naturally occurring enzymatically active polypeptide to generate engineered enzymes which are then screened by various methods to identify polypeptides and corresponding polynucleotides having a desired improvement in a specific enzyme property. A polynucleotide encoding an engineered ketoreductase with an improved property can be subjected to additional rounds of mutagenesis treatments to generate polypeptides with further improvements in the desired enzyme property.

As used herein a ketoreductase enzyme that has an improved enzyme property refers to a ketoreductase enzyme that exhibits an improvement in any enzyme property as compared to a reference ketoreductase enzyme. For the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein the comparison is generally made to the wild type ketoreductase enzyme SEQ ID NO 2 although in some embodiments the reference ketoreductase can be another improved engineered ketoreductase. Enzyme properties for which improvement is desirable include but are not limited to enzymatic activity thermal stability pH activity profile cofactor requirements refractoriness to inhibitors e.g. product inhibition sterospecificity and stereoselectivity.

As used herein the context of engineered ketoreductase enzymes derived from identifies the originating ketoreductase enzyme and or the gene encoding such ketoreductase enzyme upon which the engineering was based. For example the engineered ketoreductase enzyme of SEQ ID NO 80 was obtained by artificially evolving over multiple generations the gene encoding the ketoreductase enzyme of SEQ ID NO 2. Thus this engineered ketoreductase enzyme is derived from the wild type ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO. 2.

While not intending to be bound by any theory of operation it is believed that the improvements in enzyme properties arise from introduction of modifications into a polypeptide chain that in effect perturb the structure function of the enzyme and or its interactions with another molecule e.g. substrate . Some regions of the polypeptide may be critical to enzyme activity for example amino acids involved in catalysis and substrate binding domains such that small perturbations to these regions may have significant effects on enzyme function. Some amino acid residues may be at important positions for maintaining the secondary or tertiary structure of the enzyme and thus also produce noticeable changes in enzyme properties when modified. On the other hand some regions of the polypeptide may have a global structural role or form part of the enzyme less involved in the critical aspects of enzyme function e.g. a peptide loop connecting alpha helices and produce a measurable effect on enzyme function only when a large number of substitutions have accumulated in the region. Thus in some embodiments the number of modifications to the naturally occurring polypeptide that produces an improved ketoreductase property may comprise one or more amino acids 2 or more amino acids 5 or more amino acids 10 or more amino acids or 20 or more amino acids up to 10 of the total number of amino acids up to 20 of the total number of amino acids or up to 30 of the total number of amino acids of the reference enzyme sequence.

Because of the nature of the technique gene evolution approaches such as DNA mutagenesis and recombination biases the modification towards amino acid substitutions. Thus in various embodiments the improvements in enzyme properties can arise from substitutions at one amino acid residue 2 or more amino acid residues 5 or more amino acid residues 10 or more amino acid residue 15 or more amino acid residues 20 or more amino acid residues up to 10 of the total number of amino acids up to 20 of the total number of amino acids or up to 30 of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme sequence.

As will be apparent to the skilled artisan an analysis of amino acid substitutions for a large number of engineered ketoreductase with an improved enzyme property shows that the substitutions recur at certain amino acid residues in the ketoreductase polypeptide as well as a bias towards certain types of amino acids. This recurrence of substitutions at certain defined positions within the polypeptide may reflect the effect of amino acid residue on that particular enzyme property and its retention by the continued imposition of selection for the particular improved enzyme property. The recurrence of substitutions as well as the bias of the types of substituted amino acids can be grouped to describe the types of substitutions allowable for generating the improved enzyme property. Typically genetically encoded amino acids can be grouped into the following classes based on their side chain properties 

 Hydrophilic Amino Acid or Residue refers to an amino acid or residue having a side chain exhibiting a hydrophobicity of less than zero according to the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg et al. 1984179 125 142. Genetically encoded hydrophilic amino acids include L Thr T L Ser S L His H L Glu E L Asn N L Gln Q L Asp D L Lys K and L Arg R .

 Acidic Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophilic amino acid or residue having a side chain exhibiting a pK value of less than about 6 when the amino acid is included in a peptide or polypeptide. Acidic amino acids typically have negatively charged side chains at physiological pH due to loss of a hydrogen ion. Genetically encoded acidic amino acids include L Glu E and L Asp D .

 Basic Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophilic amino acid or residue having a side chain exhibiting a pK value of greater than about 6 when the amino acid is included in a peptide or polypeptide. Basic amino acids typically have positively charged side chains at physiological pH due to association with hydronium ion. Genetically encoded basic amino acids include L His H L Arg R and L Lys K .

 Polar Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophilic amino acid or residue having a side chain that is uncharged at physiological pH but which has at least one bond in which the pair of electrons shared in common by two atoms is held more closely by one of the atoms. Genetically encoded polar amino acids include L Asn N L Gln Q L Ser S and L Thr T .

 Hydrophobic Amino Acid or Residue refers to an amino acid or residue having a side chain exhibiting a hydrophobicity of greater than zero according to the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg et al. 1984179 125 142. Genetically encoded hydrophobic amino acids include L Pro P L Ile I L Phe F L Val V L Leu L L Trp W L Met M L Ala A and L Tyr Y .

 Aromatic Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophilic or hydrophobic amino acid or residue having a side chain that includes at least one aromatic or heteroaromatic ring. Genetically encoded aromatic amino acids include L Phe F L Tyr Y and L Trp W . Although owing to the pKa of its heteroaromatic nitrogen atom L His H is classified above as a basic residue as its side chain includes a heteroaromatic ring it may also be classified as an aromatic residue.

 Non polar Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophobic amino acid or residue having a side chain that is uncharged at physiological pH and which has bonds in which the pair of electrons shared in common by two atoms is generally held equally by each of the two atoms i.e. the side chain is not polar . Genetically encoded non polar amino acids include L Leu L L Val V L Ile I L Met M and L Ala A .

 Aliphatic Amino Acid or Residue refers to a hydrophobic amino acid or residue having an aliphatic hydrocarbon side chain. Genetically encoded aliphatic amino acids include L Ala A L Val V L Leu L and L Ile I .

The amino acid L Cys C is unusual in that it can form disulfide bridges with other L Cys C amino acids or other sulfanyl or sulfhydryl containing amino acids. The cysteine like residues include cysteine and other amino acids that contain sulfhydryl moieties that are available for formation of disulfide bridges. The ability of L Cys C and other amino acids with SH containing side chains to exist in a peptide in either the reduced free SH or oxidized disulfide bridged form affects whether L Cys C contributes net hydrophobic or hydrophilic character to a peptide. While L Cys C exhibits a hydrophobicity of 0.29 according to the normalized consensus scale of Eisenberg Eisenberg et al. 1984 supra it is to be understood that for purposes of the present disclosure L Cys C is categorized as a polar hydrophilic amino acid notwithstanding the general classifications defined above.

The amino acid Gly G is also unusual in that it bears no side chain on its carbon and as a consequence contributes only a peptide bond to a particular peptide sequence. Moreover owing to the lack of a side chain it is the only genetically encoded amino acid having an achiral carbon. Although Gly G exhibits a hydrophobicity of 0.48 according to the normalized consensus scale of Eisenberg Eisenberg et al. 1984 supra for purposes of the present invention Gly is categorized as an aliphatic amino acid or residue.

 Small Amino Acid or Residue refers to an amino acid or residue having a side chain that is composed of a total three or fewer carbon and or heteroatoms excluding the carbon and hydrogens . The small amino acids or residues may be further categorized as aliphatic non polar polar or acidic small amino acids or residues in accordance with the above definitions. Genetically encoded small amino acids include Gly L Ala A L Val V L Cys C L Asn N L Ser S L Thr T and L Asp D .

 Hydroxyl containing Amino Acid or Residue refers to an amino acid containing a hydroxyl OH moiety. Genetically encoded hydroxyl containing amino acids include L Ser S L Thr T and L Tyr Y .

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the above defined categories are not mutually exclusive. Indeed the delineated category of small amino acids includes amino acids from all of the other delineated categories except the aromatic category. Thus amino acids having side chains exhibiting two or more physico chemical properties can be included in multiple categories. As a specific example amino acid side chains having heteroaromatic moieties that include ionizable heteroatoms such as His may exhibit both aromatic properties and basic properties and can therefore be included in both the aromatic and basic categories. The appropriate classification of any amino acid or residue will be apparent to those of skill in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.

In some embodiments the substitution in the engineered ketoreductase may be a conservative substitution. The term conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains and thus typically involves substitution of the amino acid in the polypeptide with amino acids within the same or similar defined class of amino acids. By way of example and not limitation an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain may be substituted with another aliphatic amino acid e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine and methionine an amino acid with hydroxyl side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a hydroxyl side chain e.g. serine and threonine an amino acids having aromatic side chains is substituted with another amino acid having an aromatic side chain e.g. phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan and histidine an amino acid with a basic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a basis side chain e.g. lysine arginine and histidine an amino acid with an acidic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with an acidic side chain e.g. aspartic acid or glutamic acid and a hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid is replaced with another hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid respectively.

In various embodiments the substitutions for generating an improved ketoreductase can comprise conservative substitutions non conservative substitutions as well as combinations of conservative and non conservative substitutions.

In some embodiments the improved engineered ketoreductase enzymes comprise deletions of the naturally occurring ketoreductase polypeptides as well as deletions of other improved ketoreductase polypeptides. The term deletion refers to modification to the polypeptide by removal of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Deletions can comprise removal of 1 or more amino acids 2 or more amino acids 5 or more amino acids 10 or more amino acids 15 or more amino acids or 20 or more amino acids up to 10 of the total number of amino acids or up to 20 of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme while retaining enzymatic activity and or retaining the improved properties of an engineered ketoreductase enzyme. Deletions can be directed to the internal portions and or terminal portions of the polypeptide. In various embodiments the deletion can comprise a continuous segment or can be discontinuous.

In other embodiments the improved engineered ketoreductase enzymes comprise insertions of one or more amino acids to the naturally occurring ketoreductase polypeptide as well as insertions of one or more amino acids to other improved ketoreductase polypeptides. Insertions can be in the internal portions of the polypeptide or to the carboxy or amino terminus Insertions as used herein include fusion proteins as is known in the art. The insertion can be a contiguous segment of amino acids or separated by one or more of the amino acids in the naturally occurring polypeptide.

As described above the various modifications introduced into the naturally occurring polypeptide to generate an engineered ketoreductase enzyme can be targeted to a specific property of the enzyme. Thus in some embodiments the improved property of the engineered ketoreductase polypeptides is an increased enzymatic activity typically represented by an increase in specific activity e.g. product produced time weight protein as compared to the reference ketoreductase enzyme i.e. the naturally occurring ketoreductase . Exemplary methods to determine enzyme activity are provided in the Examples. Any property relating to enzyme activity may be affected including the classical enzyme properties of K Vor k changes of which can lead to increased enzymatic activity. Improvements in enzyme activity can be from about 1.5 times the enzymatic activity of the corresponding wild type ketoreductase enzyme to as much as 2 times. 5 times 10 times 20 times 25 times 50 times 75 times 100 times 150 times 200 times 250 times 300 times or more enzymatic activity than the naturally occurring ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2. In specific embodiments the engineered ketoreductase enzyme exhibits improved enzymatic activity in the range of 1.5 to 50 times 1.5 to 100 times 1.5 to 150 times 1.5 to 200 times 1.5 to 250 times or 1.5 to 300 times greater than that of the wild type ketoreductase enzyme. It is understood by the skilled artisan that the activity of any enzyme is diffusion limited such that the catalytic turnover rate cannot exceed the diffusion rate of the substrate including any required cofactors. The theoretical maximum of the diffusion limit or k K is generally about 10to 10 Ms . Hence any improvements in the enzyme activity of the ketoreductase will have an upper limit related to the diffusion rate of the substrates acted on by the ketoreductase enzyme. Ketoreductase activity can be measured by any one of standard assays used for measuring ketoreductase such as a decrease in absorbance or fluorescence of NADPH due to its oxidation with the concomitant reduction of a ketone to the corresponding alcohol or by product produced in a coupled assay. Comparisons of enzyme activities are made using a defined preparation of enzyme and a defined assay under a set condition as further described in detail herein. Generally when lysates are compared the numbers of cells and the amount of protein assayed are determined as well as use of identical expression systems and identical host cells to minimize variations in amount of enzyme produced by the host cells and present in the lysates.

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase with improved enzyme activity comprise engineered polypeptides derived from ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2. In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least about 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to SEQ ID NO 2. Amino acid residues that can be modified to generate engineered polypeptides with improved enzyme activity are shown in in which Xrepresents the modified amino acid residue. In some embodiments one or more of the naturally occurring amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO 2 can be substituted as follows 

Xis an aromatic a polar or a hydroxyl containing amino acid residue. In some embodiments the ketoreductase has all of these residue characteristics.

In some embodiments the ketoreductase has one or more of these residue characteristics. In some embodiments at least one of these residue positions does not include a substitution that is a conservative mutation with respect to SEQ ID NO 2. In some embodiments Xis an aromatic residue. In some embodiments Xis tryptophan. In some embodiments residues at other positions can be conservatively mutated with respect to SEQ ID NO 2.

In some embodiments the amino acid residues of the ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2 can be substituted with one or more specific amino acids as follows 

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductases with improved enzyme activity have substitutions in a subset of the amino acid residues indicated above. Thus in some embodiments the amino acid substitutions can occur in one or more of the amino acid positions X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X and X wherein the amino acid residues for substitution are selected as indicated above.

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase comprises one or more mutations selected from R27A R27K N31S A36V Y48H I63W R65G R65S L86I F125L K152R A160T Y194C A218T V248I K250R E290D L296V Y297W Y297F L301K L301R L301A L301S L301E L301P L301Q L301V L301T L301Y L301D Y307H Y307N and Y307S.

It is also shown herein that the various amino acid residue positions whose substitutions result in a ketoreductase with improved properties are found to cluster in certain segments of the ketoreductase enzyme which allows targeted modifications of the segments. Accordingly in some embodiments selected segments of the ketoreductase polypeptide may be subject to modification. For the reference sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 the segments affecting ketoreductase enzymatic activity include among others those represented by amino acid residues 27 to 36 40 to 65 103 to 125 144 to 169 233 to 265 and or 287 to 312. One or more of the amino acid residues within each segment or combination of segments may be modified. In some embodiments the corresponding amino acid sequences and positions for substitutions comprise 

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase enzyme with improved enzymatic activity has an amino acid sequence selected from the amino acid sequences recited in Table 1 

In other embodiments the engineered ketoreductase comprises a ketoreductase with improved thermal stability as compared to the naturally occurring ketoreductase from which the engineered enzymes are derived. Thermally stable enzymes allow longer incubations with substrate such as in conditions of high substrate concentrations used in large scale production and also minimize the amount of enzyme needed. An enzyme that has improved thermal stability refers to an enzyme that displays increased resistance to inactivation when exposed to a set temperature or set of temperatures in defined assay conditions as compared to the resistance to inactivation of a reference enzyme.

A number of methods are available for measuring enzyme thermal stability. Enzymes may be treated for a defined time period at various temperatures under a standard set of assay conditions e.g. ionic strength pH protein concentration etc. . Half inactivation temperatures i.e. temperatures at which 50 inactivation occurs after heat treatment for the defined time are used to compare the thermal stabilities of the enzymes. Another method of determining thermal stability is to treat the enzyme at a set temperature and measure the amount of enzyme activity remaining. The amount of enzyme activity remaining is compared to the activity remaining of the naturally occurring enzyme prepared under similar or identical conditions. Useful temperatures for analysis of thermal stability are temperature encompassing the reaction temperature for used for carrying out the reaction for example as in large scale reactions and or temperatures at which the engineered enzymes have been selected for improved thermal stability. For example the engineered enzymes can have improved thermal stability as compared to a reference enzyme e.g. a naturally occurring enzyme at temperatures of about 30 C. or above about 35 C. or above 40 C. or above 45 C. or above 50 C. or above 55 C. or above to about 65 C. In some embodiments the enzyme can have an improved thermal stability in which the engineered enzyme retains as compared to a reference enzyme about 10 or more activity about 15 or more activity about 20 or more activity about 30 or more activity about 50 or more activity about 70 or more activity about 90 or more activity. Under the conditions of treatment the times at which enzyme activity shows enhanced thermal stability can include about 5 hrs or more about 6 hrs or more about 12 hrs or more about 18 hrs or more about 24 hrs or more about 36 hrs or more about 48 hrs or more about 72 hrs or more. Substrate may or may not be present during thermal treatment although presence of substrate is known to stabilize enzyme structures in some instances.

In other embodiments the thermal stability of an enzyme can be measured by determining protein folding stability such as by detecting protein unfolding with calorimetry or circular dichroism. For example to determine the thermal stability of the engineered and naturally occurring ketoreductase changes in CD profile at various temperatures can be used. An Arrhenius plot of the unfolding rate constants of the enzymes is generated by use of temperature jumps e.g. from a temperature where an enzyme is active to a temperature where the enzyme is inactive and measuring changes in protein structure. The first order rate constants activation enthalpies and activation free energies between the stable and transition state of the unfolding reaction at an inactivating temperature may be compared. Typically the activation free energy increases with more thermally stable enzymes. Other methods for determining thermal stability will be apparent to the skilled artisan.

In some embodiments the improved thermal stability is separable from other properties of the ketoreductase enzymes while in other embodiments the thermal stability is also observed with another improved property. In some embodiments the ketoreductases comprise engineered ketoreductases with improved thermal stability is derived from the ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2. In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase with improved thermal stability retains about 20 or more of enzyme activity following treatment at temperature ranging from 37 to 50 C. for 16 hrs at pH 7.0. By comparison the naturally occurring ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2 retains only 5 10 of its activity after incubation at 37 C. for 16 hrs at pH 7.0 and retains essentially no activity when incubated at higher temperatures under the same conditions.

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductases with improved thermal stability comprises an amino acid sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO 2 and includes one or more of the following substitutions 

In some embodiments Xis an aromatic residue. In some embodiments Xis tryptophan. In some embodiments the ketoreductase comprises one or more conservative mutations at other positions than those listed above.

Thus in some embodiments the amino acid substitutions can occur at one or more of the amino acid positions X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X and X wherein the amino acid residues for substitution are selected as indicated above.

In some embodiments the engineered ketoreductase with improved thermal stability comprises one or more of the following substitutions as compared to SEQ ID NO 2 E44D I46L I55V I56V A60T I63V L76M G103S L106I D114G L121I Q144R S148T N158H Q223H I237G I237N I237R S239T and V253A.

As observed for the engineered ketoreductases with improved enzymatic activity various amino acid residue positions whose substitutions result in an engineered ketoreductase with improved thermal stability are also found to cluster in certain segments of the ketoreductase of SEQ ID NO 2 which allows targeted modifications. Substitutions resulting in improved thermal stability overlap with those that occur in engineered enzymes with improved enzymatic activity although some do not. Accordingly in some embodiments selected segments of the ketoreductase polypeptide may be subject to modification to generate engineered ketoreductases with improved thermal stability. For the reference sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 the segments affecting ketoreductase enzymatic activity include among others those represented by amino acid residues 27 to 36 40 to 65 103 to 125 144 to 169 233 to 265 and 287 to 312. In some embodiments the segments affecting ketoreductase enzymatic activity include among others those represented by amino acid residues 27 32 60 65 90 93 120 125 157 159 208 211 and 293 306. One or more of the amino acid residues in each segment or combination of segments may be modified.

It is to be understood that the engineered ketoreductases are not limited to those identified directly by mutagenesis or other gene evolution techniques but also include variants or analogs of the improved engineered ketoreductase polypeptides. The term variant or analog as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment having ketoreductase activity with or without retention of the improved property and has substantial identity to a portion of the engineered ketoreductase. In some embodiments analog polypeptides comprise a conservative amino acid substitution or addition or deletion of one or more amino acid residues with respect to the engineered sequence. Analogs typically are at least an enzymatically active fragment and typically as long as the full length naturally occurring reference polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. 312 amino acid residues .

In some embodiments the variant or analog of the engineered ketoreductase polypeptides can comprise an enzymatically active ketoreductase polypeptide that has about 70 or more amino acid identity about 80 or more amino acid identity about 90 or more amino acid identity about 95 or more amino acid identity about 97 or more amino acid identity about 98 or more amino acid identity or about 99 or more amino acid identity to a reference engineered ketoreductase or an enzymatically active fragment of an engineered ketoreductase.

In some embodiments the reference engineered ketoreductase is selected from the amino acid sequences recited in Table 1. An exemplary reference sequence of an improved ketoreductase is SEQ ID NO 314. In some embodiments the variant or analog of the engineered ketoreductase polypeptides can comprise an enzymatically active ketoreductase polypeptide that has about 95.5 or more amino acid identity about 97 or more amino acid identity about 98 or more amino acid identity or about 99 or more amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO 314 or an enzymatically active fragment of SEQ ID NO 314.

In some embodiments segments of the improved ketoreductase polypeptides can be deleted to generate polypeptide fragments. The term fragment as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino terminal and or carboxy terminal deletion but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence. Fragments can be at least 14 amino acids long at least 20 amino acids long at least 50 amino acids long or longer and up to 70 80 90 95 98 and 99 of the full length naturally occurring ketoreductase polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2.

The improved ketoreductase enzymes may be present within a cell present in the cellular medium or prepared in various forms such as lysates or isolated preparations. As such in some embodiments the improved ketoreductase enzyme can be an isolated polypeptide. The term isolated polypeptide refers to a polypeptide which is substantially separated from other contaminants that naturally accompany it e.g. protein lipids and polynucleotides. The term embraces polypeptides which have been removed or purified from their naturally occurring environment or expression system e.g. host cell or in vitro synthesis .

In some embodiments the isolated improved ketoreductases polypeptide is a substantially pure polypeptide composition. The term substantially pure polypeptide refers to a composition in which the polypeptide species is the predominant species present i.e. on a molar or weight basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition and is generally a substantially purified composition when the object species comprises at least about 50 percent of the macromolecular species present by mole or weight. Generally a substantially pure ketoreductase composition will comprise about 60 or more about 70 or more about 80 or more about 90 or more about 95 or more and about 98 or more of all macromolecular species by mole or weight present in the composition. In some embodiments the object species is purified to essential homogeneity i.e. contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species. Solvent species small molecules 

In another aspect the present disclosure provides polynucleotides encoding the engineered ketoreductase enzymes. The polynucleotides may be operatively linked to one or more heterologous regulatory sequences that control gene expression to create a recombinant polynucleotide capable of expressing the polypeptide. Expression constructs containing a heterologous polynucleotide encoding the engineered ketoreductase can be introduced into appropriate host cells to express the corresponding ketoreductase polypeptide. The term heterologous polynucleotide refers to any polynucleotide that is introduced into a host cell by laboratory techniques and includes polynucleotides that are removed from a host cell subjected to laboratory manipulation and then reintroduced into a host cell.

Because of the knowledge of the codons corresponding to the various amino acids availability of a protein sequence provides a description of all the polynucleotides capable of encoding the subject. The degeneracy of the genetic code where the same amino acids are encoded by alternative or synonymous codons allows an extremely large number of nucleic acids to be made all of which encode the improved ketoreductase enzymes disclosed herein. Thus having identified a particular amino acid sequence those skilled in the art could make any number of different nucleic acids by simply modifying the sequence of one or more codons in a way which does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. In this regard the present disclosure specifically contemplates each and every possible variation of polynucleotides that could be made by selecting combinations based on the possible codon choices and all such variations are to be considered specifically disclosed for any polypeptide disclosed herein including the amino acid sequences presented in Table 1.

In some embodiments the polynucleotides encoding the ketoreductases enzymes may be codon optimized for optimal production from the host organism selected for expression. The term codon optimized refers to changes in the codons of the polynucleotide encoding a protein to those preferentially used in a particular organism such that the encoded protein is efficiently expressed in the organism of interest. Although the genetic code is degenerate in that most amino acids are represented by several codons called synonyms or synonymous codons it is well known that codon usage by particular organisms is nonrandom and biased towards particular codon triplets. This codon usage bias may be higher in reference to a given gene genes of common function or ancestral origin highly expressed proteins versus low copy number proteins and the aggregate protein coding regions of an organism s genome.

The terms preferred optimal or high codon usage bias codons refers interchangeably to codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid. The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene a set of genes of common function or origin highly expressed genes the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms or combinations thereof. Codons whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression are typically optimal codons for expression.

A variety of methods are known for determining the codon frequency e.g. codon usage relative synonymous codon usage and codon preference in specific organisms including multivariate analysis for example using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis and the effective number of codons used in a gene see GCG CodonPreference Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package CodonW John Peden University of Nottingham McInerney J. O 1998 Bioinformatics 14 372 73 Stenico et al. 1994 Nucleic Acids Res. 222437 46 Wright F. 1990 Gene 87 23 29 .

Codon usage tables are available for a growing list of organisms see for example Wada et al. 199220 2111 2118 Nakamura et al. 200028 292 Duret et al. supra Henaut and Danchin and 1996 Neidhardt et al. Eds. ASM Press Washington D.C. p. 2047 2066. The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins e.g. complete protein coding sequences CDS expressed sequence tags ESTS or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences see for example Mount D. Chapter 8 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 2001 Uberbacher E. C. 1996266 259 281 Tiwari et al. 199713 263 270 .

In various embodiments the codons are preferably selected to fit the host cell in which the protein is being produced. For example preferred codons used in bacteria are used to express the gene in bacteria preferred codons used in yeast are used for expression in yeast and preferred codons used in mammals are used for expression in mammalian cells. By way of example the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO 1 has been codon optimized for expression in but otherwise encodes the naturally occurring ketoreductase of

In certain embodiments all codons need not be replaced to optimize the codon usage of the ketoreductases since the natural sequence will comprise preferred codons and because use of preferred codons may not be required for all amino acid residues. Consequently codon optimized polynucleotides encoding the ketoreductase enzymes may contain preferred codons at about 40 50 60 70 80 or greater than 90 of codon positions of the full length coding region.

In the embodiments the polynucleotides encoding the engineered ketoreductases are derived from ydl gene. In some embodiments the polynucleotides encoding the engineered ketoreductases are selected from SEQ ID NOS 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 101 103 105 107 109 111 113 115 117 119 121 123 125 127 129 131 133 135 137 139 141 143 145 147 149 151 153 155 157 159 161 163 165 167 169 171 173 175 177 179 181 183 185 187 189 191 193 195 197 199 201 203 205 207 209 211 213 215 217 219 221 223 225 227 229 231 233 235 237 239 241 243 245 247 249 251 253 255 257 259 261 263 265 267 269 271 273 275 277 279 281 283 285 287 289 291 293 295 297 299 301 303 305 307 309 311 313 315 317 319 321 323 325 327 329 331 333 335 337 339 341 343 345 347 349 351 353 355 357 359 361 363 and 365.

These polynucleotides encode the corresponding polypeptides represented by the amino acid sequences listed in Table 1 which were derived by subjecting the codon optimized ydl gene to directed gene evolution techniques described herein.

In other embodiments the polynucleotides comprise polynucleotides that have about 80 or more sequence identity about 85 or more sequence identity about 90 or more sequence identity about 95 or more sequence identity about 98 or more sequence identity or 99 or more sequence identity at the nucleotide level to a reference polynucleotide encoding an engineered ketoreductase with improved enzymatic properties or a fragment of an engineered ketoreductase with improved properties. In some embodiments the reference polynucleotide is selected from polynucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 101 103 105 107 109 111 113 115 117 119 121 123 125 127 129 131 133 135 137 139 141 143 145 147 149 151 153 155 157 159 161 163 165 167 169 171 173 175 177 179 181 183 185 187 189 191 193 195 197 199 201 203 205 207 209 211 213 215 217 219 221 223 225 227 229 231 233 235 237 239 241 243 245 247 249 251 253 255 257 259 261 263 265 267 269 271 273 275 277 279 281 283 285 287 289 291 293 295 297 299 301 303 305 307 309 311 313 315 317 319 321 323 325 327 329 331 333 335 337 339 341 343 345 347 349 351 353 355 357 359 361 363 and 365.

In some embodiments the polynucleotide encodes an enzymatically active ketoreductase and hybridizes under defined conditions such as moderately stringent or highly stringent conditions to the complement of a sequence encoding an engineered ketoreductase enzyme of the present disclosure. The phrase stringent hybridization is used herein to refer to conditions under which nucleic acid hybrids are stable. As known to those of skill in the art the stability of hybrids is reflected in the melting temperature T of the hybrids. In general the stability of a hybrid is a function of ion strength temperature G C content and the presence of chaotropic agents. The Tvalues for polynucleotides can be calculated using known methods for predicting melting temperatures see e.g. Baldino et al. 168 761 777 Bolton et al. 196248 1390 Bresslauer et al. 198683 8893 8897 Freier et al. 198683 9373 9377 Kierzek et al. 25 7840 7846 Rychlik et al. 199018 6409 6412 erratum 199119 698 Sambrook et al. supra Suggs et al. 1981 In Brown et al. eds. pp. 683 693 Academic Press and Wetmur 199126 227 259. All publications incorporate herein by reference .

Generally hybridization reactions are performed under conditions of lower stringency followed by washes of varying but higher stringency. Typically reference to hybridization stringency relates to such washing conditions. The term moderately stringent hybridization refers to conditions that permit target DNA to bind a complementary nucleic acid that has about 60 identity preferably about 75 identity about 85 identity to the target DNA with greater than about 90 identity to target polynucleotide. Exemplary moderately stringent conditions are conditions equivalent to hybridization in 50 formamide 5 Denhart s solution 5 SSPE 0.2 SDS at 42 C. followed by washing in 0.2 SSPE 0.2 SDS at 42 C.

The term high stringency hybridization refers generally to conditions that are about 10 C. or less from the thermal melting temperature Tas determined under the solution condition for a defined polynucleotide sequence. In some embodiments a high stringency condition refers to conditions that permit hybridization of only those nucleic acid sequences that form stable hybrids in 0.018M NaCl at 65 C. i.e. if a hybrid is not stable in 0.018M NaCl at 65 C. it will not be stable under high stringency conditions as contemplated herein . High stringency conditions can be provided for example by hybridization in conditions equivalent to 50 formamide 5 Denhart s solution 5 SSPE 0.2 SDS at 42 C. followed by washing in 0.1 SSPE and 0.1 SDS at 65 C. Other high stringency hybridization conditions as well as moderately stringent conditions are described in the references cited above.

An isolated polynucleotide encoding an improved ketoreductase polypeptide may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the isolated polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides and nucleic acid sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art. Guidance is provided in Sambrook et al. 20013Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press and Ausubel. F. ed. Greene Pub. Associates 1998 updates to 2006.

The term control sequence is defined herein to include all components which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polypeptide of the present disclosure. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Such control sequences include but are not limited to a leader polyadenylation sequence propeptide sequence promoter signal peptide sequence and transcription terminator. At a minimum the control sequences include a promoter and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide.

The term operably linked is defined herein as a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of a polynucleotide and or polypeptide.

The control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence. The promoter sequence is a nucleic acid sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of the coding region. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences which mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleic acid sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant truncated and hybrid promoters and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.

For bacterial host cells suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure include the promoters obtained from the lac operon agarase gene dagA levansucrase gene sacB alpha amylase gene amyL maltogenic amylase gene amyM alpha amylase gene amyQ penicillinase gene penP xylA and xylB genes and prokaryotic beta lactamase gene Villa Kamaroff et al. 197875 3727 3731 as well as the tac promoter DeBoer et al. 198380 21 25 . Further promoters are described in Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria in 1980 242 74 94 and in Sambrook et al. supra.

For filamentous fungal host cells suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure include promoters obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase aspartic proteinase neutral alpha amylase acid stable alpha amylase or glucoamylase glaA lipase alkaline protease triose phosphate isomerase acetamidase and trypsin like protease WO 96 00787 as well as the NA2 tpi promoter a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for neutral alpha amylase and triose phosphate isomerase and mutant truncated and hybrid promoters thereof.

In a yeast host useful promoters can be from the genes for enolase ENO 1 galactokinase GAL1 alcohol dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase ADH2 GAP and 3 phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al. 19928 423 488.

The control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator which is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.

For example exemplary transcription terminators for filamentous fungal host cells can be obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase glucoamylase anthranilate synthase alpha glucosidase and trypsin like protease.

Exemplary terminators for yeast host cells can be obtained from the genes for enolase cytochrome C CYC1 and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al. 1992 supra.

The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used. Exemplary leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase and triose phosphate isomerase. Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for enolase ENO 1 3 phosphoglycerate kinase alpha factor and alcohol dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase ADH2 GAP .

The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence a sequence operably linked to the 3 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence and which when transcribed is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence which is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Exemplary polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells can be from the genes for TAKA amylase glucoamylase anthranilate synthase trypsin like protease and alpha glucosidase. Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman 199515 5983 5990.

The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell s secretory pathway. The 5 end of the coding sequence of the nucleic acid sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding region that encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively the 5 end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding region that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding region may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding region.

Alternatively the foreign signal peptide coding region may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding region in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However any signal peptide coding region which directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.

Effective signal peptide coding regions for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for NClB 11837 maltogenic amylase alpha amylase subtilisin beta lactamase neutral proteases nprT nprS nprM and prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva 199357 109 137.

Effective signal peptide coding regions for filamentous fungal host cells can be the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase neutral amylase glucoamylase aspartic proteinase cellulase and lipase.

Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells can be from the genes for alpha factor and invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding regions are described by Romanos et al. 1992 supra.

The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence positioned at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide or a zymogen in some cases . A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to a mature active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding region may be obtained from the genes for alkaline protease aprE neutral protease nprT alpha factor aspartic proteinase and lactase WO 95 33836 .

Where both signal peptide and propeptide regions are present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide the propeptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of the propeptide region.

It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences which allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those which cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus including the presence of a regulatory compound. In prokaryotic host cells suitable regulatory sequences include the lac tac and trp operator systems. In yeast host cells suitable regulatory systems include as examples the ADH2 system or GAL1 system. In filamentous fungi suitable regulatory sequences include the TAKA alpha amylase promoter glucoamylase promoter and glucoamylase promoter.

Other examples of regulatory sequences are those which allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems these include the dihydrofolate reductase gene which is amplified in the presence of methotrexate and the metallothionein genes which are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases the nucleic acid sequence encoding the KRED polypeptide of the present invention would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.

Thus in another aspect the present disclosure is also directed to a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding an improved ketoreductase polypeptide or a variant thereof and one or more expression regulating regions such as a promoter and a terminator a replication origin etc. depending on the type of hosts into which they are to be introduced. The various nucleic acid and control sequences described above may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector which may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively the nucleic acid sequence of the present disclosure may be expressed by inserting the nucleic acid sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.

The recombinant expression vector may be any vector e.g. a plasmid or virus which can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about the expression of the polynucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.

The expression vector may be an autonomously replicating vector i.e. a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication e.g. a plasmid an extrachromosomal element a minichromosome or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self replication. Alternatively the vector may be one which when introduced into the host cell is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome s into which it has been integrated. Furthermore a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids which together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell or a transposon may be used.

The expression vector of the present invention preferably contains one or more selectable markers which permit easy selection of transformed cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance resistance to heavy metals prototrophy to auxotrophs and the like. Examples of bacterial selectable markers are the dal genes from or or markers which confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin kanamycin chloramphenicol Example 1 or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells are ADE2 HIS3 LEU2 LYS2 MET3 TRP1 and URA3.

Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include but are not limited to amdS acetamidase argB ornithine carbamoyltransferase bar phosphinothricin acetyltransferase hph hygromycin phosphotransferase niaD nitrate reductase pyrG orotidine 5 phosphate decarboxylase sC sulfate adenyltransferase and trpC anthranilate synthase as well as equivalents thereof. Embodiments for use in an cell include the amdS and pyrG genes of or and the bar gene of

The expression vectors of the present invention preferably contain an element s that permits integration of the vector into the host cell s genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome. For integration into the host cell genome the vector may rely on the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration of the vector into the genome by homologous or nonhomologous recombination.

Alternatively the expression vector may contain additional nucleic acid sequences for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell. The additional nucleic acid sequences enable the vector to be integrated into the host cell genome at a precise location s in the chromosome s . To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location the integrational elements should preferably contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids such as 100 to 10 000 base pairs preferably 400 to 10 000 base pairs and most preferably 800 to 10 000 base pairs which are highly homologous with the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell.

Furthermore the integrational elements may be non encoding or encoding nucleic acid sequences. On the other hand the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non homologous recombination.

For autonomous replication the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. Examples of bacterial origins of replication are P15A ori as shown in the plasmid of or the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322 pUC19 pACYC177 which plasmid has the P15A ori or pACYC184 permitting replication in and pUB110 pE194 pTA1060 or pAM 1 permitting replication in . Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication ARS1 ARS4 the combination of ARS1 and CEN3 and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6. The origin of replication may be one having a mutation which makes it s functioning temperature sensitive in the host cell see e.g. Ehrlich 197875 1433 .

More than one copy of a nucleic acid sequence of the present invention may be inserted into the host cell to increase production of the gene product. An increase in the copy number of the nucleic acid sequence can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the nucleic acid sequence where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene and thereby additional copies of the nucleic acid sequence can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.

Many of the expression vectors for use in the present invention are commercially available. Suitable commercial expression vectors include p3xFLAGTM expression vectors from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals St. Louis Mo. which includes a CMV promoter and hGH polyadenylation site for expression in mammalian host cells and a pBR322 origin of replication and ampicillin resistance markers for amplification in . Other suitable expression vectors are pBluescriptII SK and pBK CMV which are commercially available from Stratagene LaJolla Calif. and plasmids which are derived from pBR322 Gibco BRL pUC Gibco BRL pREP4 pCEP4 Invitrogen or pPoly Lathe et al. 198757 193 201 .

In another aspect the present disclosure provides a host cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding an improved ketoreductase polypeptide of the present disclosure the polynucleotide being operatively linked to one or more control sequences for expression of the ketoreductase enzyme in the host cell. Host cells for use in expressing the KRED polypeptides encoded by the expression vectors of the present invention are well known in the art and include but are not limited to bacterial cells such as and cells fungal cells such as yeast cells e.g. or ATCC Accession No. 201178 insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells animal cells such as CHO COS BHK 293 and Bowes melanoma cells and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and growth conditions for the above described host cells are well known in the art.

Polynucleotides for expression of the ketoreductase may be introduced into cells by various methods known in the art. Techniques include among others electroporation biolistic particle bombardment liposome mediated transfection calcium chloride transfection and protoplast fusion. Various methods for introducing polynucleotides into cells will be apparent to the skilled artisan.

An exemplary host cell is W3110 as described in Example 1. The expression vector was created by operatively linking a polynucleotide encoding an improved ketoreductase into the plasmid pCK110900 operatively linked to the lac promoter under control of the lacI repressor. The expression vector also contained the P15a origin of replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene. Cells containing the subject polynucleotide in W3110 were isolated by subjecting the cells to chloramphenicol selection.

To make the improved KRED polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present disclosure the naturally occurring ketoreductase enzyme that catalyzes the reduction reaction is obtained from . In some embodiments the parent polynucleotide sequence is codon optimized to enhance expression of the ketoreductase in a specified host cell. As an illustration the parental polynucleotide sequence encoding the wild type KRED polypeptide ydl of was constructed from oligonucleotides composed of 42 nucleotides based upon the known polypeptide sequence of KRED sequence ydl available in Genbank database NP010159 GI 6320079 . The parental polynucleotide sequence designated as SEQ ID NO 1 was codon optimized for expression in and the codon optimized polynucleotide cloned into the SfiI cloning sites of the expression vector pCK110900 depicted in placing the expression of the ketoreductase gene under the control of the lac promoter and lad repressor gene. The expression vector also contained the P15A origin of replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene. Clones expressing the active ketoreductase in W3110 were identified and the genes sequenced to confirm their identity. The sequence designated ydlC SEQ ID NO 1 was the parent sequence utilized as the starting point for all experiments and library construction of engineered ketoreductases evolved from the ketoreductase.

The engineered ketoreductases can be obtained by subjecting the polynucleotide encoding the naturally occurring ketoreductase to mutagenesis and or directed evolution methods. An exemplary directed evolution technique is mutagenesis and or DNA shuffling as described in Stemmer 199491 10747 10751 WO 95 22625 WO 97 0078 WO 97 35966 WO 98 27230 WO 00 42651 WO 01 75767 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 537 746. Other directed evolution procedures that can be used include among others staggered extension process StEP in vitro recombination Zhao et al. 199816 258 261 mutagenic PCR Caldwell et al. 19943 S136 S140 and cassette mutagenesis Black et al. 199693 3525 3529 .

The clones obtained following mutagenesis treatment are screened for engineered ketoreductases having a desired improved enzyme property. Measuring enzyme activity from the expression libraries can be performed using the standard biochemistry technique of monitoring the rate of decrease via a decrease in absorbance or fluorescence of NADH or NADPH concentration as it is converted into NAD or NADP. In this reaction the NADH or NADPH is consumed oxidized by the ketoreductase as the ketoreductase reduces a ketone substrate to the corresponding hydroxyl group. The rate of decrease of NADH or NADPH concentration as measured by the decrease in absorbance or fluorescence per unit time indicates the relative enzymatic activity of the KRED polypeptide in a fixed amount of the lysate or a lyophilized powder made therefrom . Example 11 discloses an exemplary biochemical assay for ketoreductase activity. Where the improved enzyme property desired is thermal stability enzyme activity may be measured after subjecting the enzyme preparations to a defined temperature and measuring the amount of enzyme activity remaining after heat treatments such as in Example 12. Clones containing a polynucleotide encoding a ketoreductase are then isolated sequenced to identify the nucleotide sequence changes if any and used to express the enzyme in a host cell.

Where the sequence of the engineered polypeptide is known the polynucleotides encoding the enzyme can be prepared by standard solid phase methods according to known synthetic methods. In some embodiments fragments of up to about 100 bases can be individually synthesized then joined e.g. by enzymatic or chemical ligation methods or polymerase mediated methods to form any desired continuous sequence. For example polynucleotides and oligonucleotides of the invention can be prepared by chemical synthesis using e.g. the classical phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage et al. 198122 1859 69 or the method described by Matthes et al. 19843 801 05 e.g. as it is typically practiced in automated synthetic methods. According to the phosphoramidite method oligonucleotides are synthesized e.g. in an automatic DNA synthesizer purified annealed ligated and cloned in appropriate vectors. In addition essentially any nucleic acid can be obtained from any of a variety of commercial sources such as The Midland Certified Reagent Company Midland Tex. The Great American Gene Company Ramona Calif. ExpressGen Inc. Chicago Ill. Operon Technologies Inc. Alameda Calif. and many others.

Engineered ketoreductase enzymes expressed in a host cell can be recovered from the cells and or the culture medium using any one or more of the well known techniques for protein purification including among others lysozyme treatment sonication filtration salting out ultra centrifugation and chromatography. Suitable solutions for lysing and the high efficiency extraction of proteins from bacteria such as are commercially available under the trade name CelLytic B from Sigma Aldrich of St. Louis Mo.

Chromatographic techniques for isolation of the ketoreductase polypeptide include among others reverse phase chromatography high performance liquid chromatography ion exchange chromatography gel electrophoresis and affinity chromatography. Conditions for purifying a particular enzyme will depend in part on factors such as net charge hydrophobicity hydrophilicity molecular weight molecular shape etc. and will be apparent to those having skill in the art.

In some embodiments affinity techniques may be used to isolate the improved ketoreductase enzymes. For affinity chromatography purification any antibody which specifically binds the ketoreductase polypeptide may be used. For the production of antibodies various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. may be immunized by injection with a compound. The compound may be attached to a suitable carrier such as BSA by means of a side chain functional group or linkers attached to a side chain functional group. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanin dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacilli Calmette Guerin and

An exemplary process for recovering the KRED polypeptides from cell lysate for applications in a chemical process is disclosed in Example 2.

The engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein catalyze the reduction of 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate enantiomers according to structural formula Ia 

Skilled artisans will also recognize that when the oxo group at the 3 position is reduced to a hydroxy group the carbon atom of the 3 position in the resultant 3 5 dihydroxy ester is also chiral. Thus each of the enantiomers of structural formulae Ia and Ib can yield two different reduction products a syn diastereomer and anti diastereomer. The syn and anti diastereomers produced by reduction of enantiomer Ia are illustrated below as compounds IIa and IIb respectively and those produced by reduction of enantiomer Ib are illustrated as compounds IIc and IId respectively 

The absolute configurations about the 3 carbon are illustrated in the above structural diagrams. The R or S designations for the absolute configurations about the 5 carbon will depend upon the identity of the X. When X is cyano the 5 carbon is designated R in structures Ia IIa and IIb and designated S in structures Ib IIc and IId . When X is halo or hydroxy the 5 carbon is designated S in structures Ia IIa and IIb and designated R in structures Ib IIc and IId . This is due to the conventions for designating R or S which reverse between X cyano and X halo or hydroxyl.

In some embodiments the reduction reaction is also highly diastereoselective producing the syn diastereomer of structural formula IIa in 99.95 diasteromeric purity i.e. 0.05 of the anti diastereomer of structural formula IIb i.e. .99.9 diastereomeric excess . Many embodiments of the engineered ketoreductases described herein exhibit even higher stereoselectivities. For example in reactions of t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate structural formula Ia X CN R t butyl carried out with the engineered ketoreductases referenced in Table 2 diastereoselectivities for 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate structural formula IIa X CN R t butyl of 99.99 have been observed. Thus diastereoselective reductions ranging from 99.9 99.91 99.92 99.93 99.94 99.95 99.96 99.97 99.98 and even 99.99 diastereoselectivity can be readily achieved with the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein.

The high degree of diastereoselectivity observed in reduction reactions catalyzed by the engineered ketoreductases described herein enables the ability to produce preparations of the syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester of structural formula IIa that are substantially diastereomerically pure i.e. that are substantially free of all other diastereomers without having to perform chiral isolation or separation steps. Because the reaction can be performed in high yield utilizing highly enantiopure 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester Ia starting materials the present disclosure enables the preparation of syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate esters of structural formula IIa that are substantially diastereomerically pure with minimal or no purification. In contrast to the present disclosure prior reduction methods e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 596 879 produced 3 4 IIb X CN R t butyl which is an oil and which was then reacted to form t butyl 6 cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4 acetate X CN R t butyl R R methyl a crystalline compound. In the prior known methods the purity was improved by crystallization to lower the IIb content which resulted in yield losses of IIa .

The high degree of diasteromeric purity of the reduction products obtained with the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein is illustrated in which compares the LC MS MS chromatogram of tert butyl 6 cyanoethyl 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate structural formula IIa X CN R t butyl prepared from commercially available crystalline t butyl 6R cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4R acetate structural formula IVa X CN R t butyl R R methyl Aldrich St. Louis Mo. with that of crude tert butyl 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate oil prepared from t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate structural formula Ia X CN R t butyl using an engineered ketoreductase enzyme of the present disclosure. As illustrated in compared to a tert butyl 6R cyanoethyl 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate sample prepared from commercially available crystalline t butyl 6R cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4R acetate containing less than about 0.1 of the undesired 3S 5R diastereomer IIb the crude tert butyl 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate oil prepared using the engineered ketoreductase of the disclosure contains no more than possibly 0.005 of the undesired 3S 5R diastereomer.

Similarly striking differences in diastereomeric purity are observed for t butyl 6R cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4R acetate see Example 23 and . GC MS chromatograms comparing the stereoisomeric purity of the commercially available crystalline TBIN 4R cis 1 1 dimethyl 6 cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4 acetate and crude extracted but never crystallized TBIN prepared from crude C7 diol prepared using an engineered ketoreductase enzyme of the present invention are illustrated in . Likewise the diastereomeric purity of atorvastatin produced from C7 diol prepared using the methods of the present disclosure are greater than what is currently present in commercial preparations e.g. 0.03 atorvastatin diastereomer present in a Lipitor pill .

As used herein a compound is enriched in a particular stereoisomer when that stereoisomer is present in excess over any other stereoisomer present in the compound. A compound that is enriched in a particular stereoisomer will typically comprise at least about 60 70 80 90 or even more of the specified stereoisomer. The amount of enrichment of a particular stereoisomer can be confirmed using conventional analytical methods routinely used by those of skill in the art as will be discussed in more detail below.

In some embodiments the amount of undesired stereoisomers may be less than 10 for example less than 9 less than 8 less than 7 less than 6 less than 5 less than 4 less than 3 less than 2 less than 1 or even less than 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.2 or 0.1 . Stereoisomerically enriched compounds that contain at least about 99.5 or more of the desired stereoisomer are referred to herein as substantially pure stereoisomers. In some embodiments compounds that are substantially pure in a specified stereoisomer contain greater than 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.9 99.91 99.92 99.93 99.94 99.95 99.96 99.97 99.98 or even 99.99 of the particular stereoisomer. Stereoisomerically enriched compounds that contain 99.99 of the desired stereoisomer are referred to herein as pure stereoisomers.

The stereoisomeric purity of any chiral compound described herein can be determined or confirmed using conventional analytical methods known in the art. Highly sensitive LC MS and GC MS methods and for assessing diastereoisomeric purity of the synthetic intermediates described herein are provided in Examples 5 7. A method for determining diastereomeric purity of atorvastatin is given in Ert rk et al. 200333 5 1017 23.

As is known by those of skill in the art ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions typically require a cofactor. Reduction reactions catalyzed by the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein also typically require a cofactor although many embodiments of the engineered ketoreductases require far less cofactor than reactions catalyzed with wild type ketoreductase enzymes. As used herein the term cofactor refers to a non protein compound that operates in combination with a ketoreductase enzyme. Cofactors suitable for use with the engineered ketoreductase enzymes described herein include but are not limited to NADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH the reduced form of NADP NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and NADH the reduced form of NAD . Equation 1 below illustrates an embodiment of a ketoreductase KRED catalyzed reduction reaction utilizing NADH or NADPH as a cofactor which are represented as alternatives by the designation NAD P H 

As illustrated the reduced form of the cofactor is added to the reaction mixture. The reduced NAD P H form can be optionally regenerated from the oxidized NAD P form using a cofactor regeneration system.

The term cofactor regeneration system refers to a set of reactants that participate in a reaction that reduces the oxidized form of the cofactor e.g. NADP to NADPH . Cofactors oxidized by the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction of the 5 hydroxy 3 oxo hexanoate ester are regenerated in reduced form by the cofactor regeneration system. Cofactor regeneration systems comprise a stoichiometric reductant that is a source of reducing hydrogen equivalents and is capable of reducing the oxidized form of the cofactor. The cofactor regeneration system may further comprise a catalyst for example an enzyme catalyst that catalyzes the reduction of the oxidized form of the cofactor by the reductant. Cofactor regeneration systems to regenerate NADH or NADPH from NAD or NADP respectively are known in the art and may be used in the methods described herein.

Suitable exemplary cofactor regeneration systems that may be employed include but are not limited to glucose and glucose dehydrogenase formate and formate dehydrogenase glucose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase a secondary e.g. isopropanol alcohol and secondary alcohol dehydrogenase phosphite and phosphite dehydrogenase molecular hydrogen and hydrogenase and the like. These systems may be used in combination with either NADP NADPH or NAD NADH as the cofactor. Electrochemical regeneration using hydrogenase may also be used as a cofactor regeneration system. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 538 867 and 6 495 023 both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Chemical cofactor regeneration systems comprising a metal catalyst and a reducing agent for example molecular hydrogen or formate are also suitable. See e.g. PCT publication WO 2000 053731 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The terms glucose dehydrogenase and GDH are used interchangeably herein to refer to an NAD or NADP dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of D glucose and NAD or NADP to gluconic acid and NADH or NADPH respectively. Equation 2 below describes the glucose dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction of NAD or NADP by glucose.

Glucose dehydrogenases that are suitable for use in the practice of the methods described herein include both naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenases as well as non naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenases. Naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenase encoding genes have been reported in the literature. For example the 61297 GDH gene was expressed in and was reported to exhibit the same physicochemical properties as the enzyme produced in its native host Vasantha et al. 198380 785 . The gene sequence of the GDH gene which corresponds to Genbank Acc. No. M12276 was reported by Lampel et al. 1986166 238 243 and in corrected form by Yamane et al. 1996142 3047 3056 as Genbank Acc. No. D50453. Naturally occurring GDH genes also include those that encode the GDH from ATCC 14579 2003 423 87 91 Genbank Acc. No. AE017013 and 1988 174 485 490 Genbank Acc. No. X123701990 70 363 369 Genbank Acc. No. GI216270 . Glucose dehydrogenases from sp. are provided in PCT publication WO 2005 018579 as SEQ ID NOS 10 and 12 encoded by polynucleotide sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS 9 and 11 respectively of the PCT publication the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Non naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenases may be generated using known methods such as for example mutagenesis directed evolution and the like. GDH enzymes having suitable activity whether naturally occurring or non naturally occurring may be readily identified using the assay described in Example 4 of PCT publication WO 2005 018579 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary non naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenases are provided in PCT publication WO 2005 018579 as SEQ ID NOS 62 64 66 68 122 124 and 126. The polynucleotide sequences that encode them are provided in PCT publication WO 2005 018579 as SEQ ID NOS 61 63 65 67 121 123 and 125 respectively. All of these sequences are incorporated herein by reference. Additional non naturally occurring glucose dehydrogenases that are suitable for use in the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions disclosed herein are provided in U.S. application publication Nos. 2005 0095619 and 2005 0153417 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Glucose dehydrogenases employed in the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein may exhibit an activity of at least about 10 mol min mg and sometimes at least about 10 mol min mg or about 10 mol min mg up to about 10 mol min mg or higher in the assay described in Example 4 of PCT publication WO 2005 018579.

When glucose and glucose dehydrogenase are employed as the cofactor regeneration system as the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester substrate is reduced by the engineered ketoreductase and NADH or NADPH the resulting NAD or NADP is reduced by the coupled oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid by the glucose dehydrogenase. The net reaction is described by equation 3 which is the summation of equations 1 and 2 

The ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein are generally carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents include water organic solvents e.g. ethyl acetate butyl acetate 1 octanol heptane octane methyl t butyl ether MTBE toluene and the like ionic liquids e.g. 1 ethyl 4 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate and the like . In some embodiments aqueous solvents including water and aqueous co solvent systems are used.

Exemplary aqueous co solvent systems have water and one or more organic solvent. In general an organic solvent component of an aqueous co solvent system is selected such that it does not completely inactivate the ketoreductase enzyme. Appropriate co solvent systems can be readily identified by measuring the enzymatic activity of the specified engineered ketoreductase enzyme with the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester of interest in the candidate solvent system utilizing an enzyme activity assay such as those described in the Examples.

The organic solvent component of an aqueous co solvent system may be miscible with the aqueous component providing a single liquid phase or may be partly miscible or immiscible with the aqueous component providing two liquid phases. Generally when an aqueous co solvent system is employed it is selected to be biphasic with water dispersed in an organic solvent or vice versa. Generally when an aqueous co solvent system is utilized it is desirable to select an organic solvent that can be readily separated from the aqueous phase. In general the ratio of water to organic solvent in the co solvent system is typically in the range of from about 90 10 to about 10 90 v v organic solvent to water and between 80 20 and 20 80 v v organic solvent to water. The co solvent system may be pre formed prior to addition to the reaction mixture or it may be formed in situ in the reaction vessel.

The aqueous solvent water or aqueous co solvent system may be pH buffered or unbuffered. The reduction of the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester to the corresponding 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester can be carried out at a pH of about 5 or above. Generally the reduction is carried out at a pH of about 10 or below usually in the range of from about 5 to about 10. In some embodiments the reduction is carried out at a pH of about 9 or below usually in the range of from about 5 to about 9. In some embodiments the reduction is carried out at a pH of about 8 or below often in the range of from about 5 to about 8 and usually in the range of from about 6 to about 8. The reduction may also be carried out at a pH of about 7.8 or below or 7.5 or below. Alternatively the reduction may be carried out a neutral pH i.e. about 7.

During the course of the reduction reactions the pH of the reaction mixture may change. The pH of the reaction mixture may be maintained at a desired pH or within a desired pH range by the addition of an acid or a base during the course of the reaction. Alternatively the pH may be controlled by using an aqueous solvent that comprises a buffer. Suitable buffers to maintain desired pH ranges are known in the art and include for example phosphate buffer triethanolamine buffer and the like. Combinations of buffering and acid or base addition may also be used.

When the glucose glucose dehydrogenase cofactor regeneration system is employed the co production of gluconic acid pKa 3.6 as represented in equation 3 causes the pH of the reaction mixture to drop if the resulting aqueous gluconic acid is not otherwise neutralized. The pH of the reaction mixture may be maintained at the desired level by standard buffering techniques wherein the buffer neutralizes the gluconic acid up to the buffering capacity provided or by the addition of a base concurrent with the course of the conversion. Combinations of buffering and base addition may also be used. Suitable buffers to maintain desired pH ranges are described above. Suitable bases for neutralization of gluconic acid are organic bases for example amines alkoxides and the like and inorganic bases for example hydroxide salts e.g. NaOH carbonate salts e.g. KCO bicarbonate salts e.g. NaHCO basic phosphate salts e.g. KHPO NaPO and the like. The addition of a base concurrent with the course of the conversion may be done manually while monitoring the reaction mixture pH or more conveniently by using an automatic titrator as a pH stat. A combination of partial buffering capacity and base addition can also be used for process control.

In such reduction reactions when the pH is maintained by buffering or by addition of a base over the course of the conversion an aqueous gluconate salt rather than aqueous gluconic acid is the product of the overall process. For example equation 4 represents the overall process when aqueous sodium hydroxide Na OH is added over the course of the reaction to maintain an initial pH below about 5 or above.

When base addition is employed to neutralize the gluconic acid released during the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reaction the progress of the conversion may be monitored by the amount of base added to maintain the pH. Typically bases added to unbuffered or partially buffered reaction mixtures over the course of the reduction are added in aqueous solutions.

In some embodiments when the process is carried out using whole cells of the host organism the whole cell may natively provide the cofactor. Alternatively or in combination the cell may natively or recombinantly provide the glucose dehydrogenase.

The terms formate dehydrogenase and FDH are used interchangeably herein to refer to an NAD or NADP dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of formate and NAD or NADP to carbon dioxide and NADH or NADPH respectively. Formate dehydrogenases that are suitable for use as cofactor regenerating systems in the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein include both naturally occurring formate dehydrogenases as well as non naturally occurring formate dehydrogenases. Formate dehydrogenases include those corresponding to SEQ ID NOS 70 sp. and 72 of PCT publication WO 2005 018579 which are encoded by polynucleotide sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS 69 and 71 respectively of PCT publication 2005 018579 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Formate dehydrogenases employed in the methods described herein whether naturally occurring or non naturally occurring may exhibit an activity of at least about 1 mol min mg sometimes at least about 10 mol min mg or at least about 10 mol min mg up to about 10 mol min mg or higher and can be readily screened for activity in the assay described in Example 4 of PCT publication WO 2005 018579.

As used herein the term formate refers to formate anion HCO formic acid HCOH and mixtures thereof. Formate may be provided in the form of a salt typically an alkali or ammonium salt for example HCONa KHCONH and the like in the form of formic acid typically aqueous formic acid or mixtures thereof. Formic acid is a moderate acid. In aqueous solutions within several pH units of its pKa pKa 3.7 in water formate is present as both HCO and HCOH in equilibrium concentrations. At pH values above about pH 4 formate is predominantly present as HCO. When formate is provided as formic acid the reaction mixture is typically buffered or made less acidic by adding a base to provide the desired pH typically of about pH 5 or above. Suitable bases for neutralization of formic acid include but are not limited to organic bases for example amines alkoxides and the like and inorganic bases for example hydroxide salts e.g. NaOH carbonate salts e.g. KCO bicarbonate salts e.g. NaHCO basic phosphate salts e.g. KHPO NaPO and the like.

For pH values above about pH 5 at which formate is predominantly present as HCO equation 5 below describes the formate dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction of NAD or NADP by formate.

When formate and formate dehydrogenase are employed as the cofactor regeneration system the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester is reduced by the ketoreductase and NADH or NADPH the resulting NAD or NADP is reduced by the coupled oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide by the formate dehydrogenase. An embodiment of the net reaction is described by equation 6 which is the summation of equations 1 and 5 

Equation 6 shows that when the formate formate dehydrogenase cofactor regeneration system is employed for the reduction of 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester in aqueous solution at a pH above about pH 5 protons in solution are consumed and the reaction causes the pH of the reaction mixture to rise if it is not otherwise buffered or re acidified. The pH of the reaction mixture may be maintained at the desired level by standard buffering techniques wherein the buffer releases protons up to the buffering capacity provided or by the addition of an acid concurrent with the course of the conversion. Suitable acids to add during the course of the reaction to maintain the pH include organic acids for example carboxylic acids sulfonic acids phosphonic acids and the like mineral acids for example hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and the like acidic salts for example dihydrogenphosphate salts e.g. KHPO bisulfate salts e.g. NaHSO and the like. Some embodiments utilize formic acid whereby both the formate concentration and the pH of the solution are maintained. For example equation 7 represents the overall process when formic acid HCOH is added over the course of the reaction to maintain an initial pH above about pH 5. While the formate is present predominantly as HCO in the reaction mixture the HCO concentration is maintained while the conversion in net consumes the added formic acid.

When acid addition is employed to maintain the pH during a reduction reaction using the formate formate dehydrogenase cofactor regeneration system the progress of the conversion may be monitored by the amount of acid added to maintain the pH. Typically acids added to unbuffered or partially buffered reaction mixtures over the course of conversion are added in aqueous solutions.

The terms secondary alcohol dehydrogenase and sADH are used interchangeably herein to refer to an NAD or NADP dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a secondary alcohol and NAD or NADP to a ketone and NADH or NADPH respectively. Equation 8 below describes the reduction of NAD or NADP by a secondary alcohol illustrated by isopropanol.

Secondary alcohol dehydrogenases that are suitable for use as cofactor regenerating systems in the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein include both naturally occurring secondary alcohol dehydrogenases as well as non naturally occurring secondary alcohol dehydrogenases. Naturally occurring secondary alcohol dehydrogenases include known alcohol dehydrogenases from and and non naturally occurring secondary alcohol dehydrogenases include engineered alcohol dehydrogenases derived therefrom. Secondary alcohol dehydrogenases employed in the methods described herein whether naturally occurring or non naturally occurring may exhibit an activity of at least about 1 mol min mg sometimes at least about 10 mol min mg or at least about 10 mol min mg up to about 10 mol min mg or higher.

Suitable secondary alcohols include lower secondary alkanols and aryl alkyl carbinols. Examples of lower secondary alcohols include isopropanol 2 butanol 3 methyl 2 butanol 2 pentanol 3 pentanol 3 3 dimethyl 2 butanol and the like. In one embodiment the secondary alcohol is isopropanol. Suitable aryl alkyl carbinols include unsubstituted and substituted 1 arylethanols.

When a secondary alcohol and secondary alcohol dehydrogenase are employed as the cofactor regeneration system as the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester substrate is reduced by the engineered ketoreductase and NADH or NADPH the resulting NAD or NADP is reduced by the coupled oxidation of the secondary alcohol to the ketone by the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase. The net reaction is described by equation 9 illustrated with isopropanol which is the summation of equations 1 and 8 

It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan this reaction of a ketone and alcohol to the corresponding alcohol and ketone respectively is reversible and will reach an equilibrium. The inventors found that the forward reaction is thermodynamically favored and that only a modest excess of isopropanol is required to obtain high conversion of the 3 oxohexanoate ester to the desired 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester at the equilibrium. Typically the molar ratio of the secondary alcohol to the 3 oxohexanoate ester provided to the reaction is in the range of 1 to 20. In some embodiments this molar ratio is 1 to 10 1 to 5 or 1 to 2.

Some engineered ketoreductases also have activity to dehydrogenate a secondary alcohol reductant. In some embodiments using secondary alcohol as reductant the engineered ketoreductase and the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase are the same enzyme.

In carrying out embodiments of the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein employing a cofactor regeneration system either the oxidized or reduced form of the cofactor may be provided initially. As described above the cofactor regeneration system converts oxidized cofactor to its reduced form which is then utilized in the reduction of the ketoreductase substrate i.e. 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester to the corresponding 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester.

In some embodiments cofactor regeneration systems are not used. For reduction reactions carried out without the use of a cofactor regenerating systems the cofactor is added to the reaction mixture in reduced form.

In carrying out the enantioselective reduction reactions described herein the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and any enzymes comprising the optional cofactor regeneration system may be added to the reaction mixture in the form of the purified enzymes whole cells transformed with gene s encoding the enzymes and or cell extracts and or lysates of such cells. The gene s encoding the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and the optional cofactor regeneration enzymes can be transformed into host cells separately or together into the same host cell. For example in some embodiments one set of host cells can be transformed with gene s encoding the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and another set can be transformed with gene s encoding the cofactor regeneration enzymes. Both sets of transformed cells can be utilized together in the reaction mixture in the form of whole cells or in the form of lysates or extracts derived therefrom. In other embodiments a host cell can be transformed with gene s encoding both the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and the cofactor regeneration enzymes.

Whole cells transformed with gene s encoding the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and or the optional cofactor regeneration enzymes or cell extracts and or lysates thereof may be employed in a variety of different forms including solid e.g. lyophilized spray dried and the like or semisolid e.g. a crude paste .

The cell extracts or cell lysates may be partially purified by precipitation ammonium sulfate polyethyleneimine heat treatment or the like followed by a desalting procedure prior to lyophilization e.g. ultrafiltration dialysis and the like . Any of the cell preparations may be stabilized by crosslinking using known crosslinking agents such as for example glutaraldehyde or immobilization to a solid phase e.g. Eupergit C and the like .

The solid reactants e.g. enzyme salts etc. may be provided to the reaction in a variety of different forms including powder e.g. lyophilized spray dried and the like solution emulsion suspension and the like. The reactants can be readily lyophilized or spray dried using methods and equipment that are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For example the protein solution can be frozen at 80 C. in small aliquots then added to a prechilled lyophilization chamber followed by the application of a vacuum. After the removal of water from the samples the temperature is typically raised to 4 C. for two hours before release of the vacuum and retrieval of the lyophilized samples.

The quantities of reactants used in the reduction reaction will generally vary depending on the quantities of 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester desired and concomitantly the amount of ketoreductase substrate employed. The following guidelines can be used to determine the amounts of ketoreductase cofactor and optional cofactor regeneration system to use. Generally 5 hydroxy 3 oxo hexanoate ester substrates are employed at a concentration of about 20 to 300 grams liter using from about 50 mg to about 5 g of ketoreductase and about 10 mg to about 150 mg of cofactor. Those having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand how to vary these quantities to tailor them to the desired level of productivity and scale of production. Appropriate quantities of optional cofactor regeneration system may be readily determined by routine experimentation based on the amount of cofactor and or ketoreductase utilized. In general the reductant e.g. glucose formate isopropanol is utilized at levels above the equimolar level of ketoreductase substrate to achieve essentially complete or near complete conversion of the ketoreductase substrate.

The order of addition of reactants is not critical. The reactants may be added together at the same time to a solvent e.g. monophasic solvent biphasic aqueous co solvent system and the like or alternatively some of the reactants may be added separately and some together at different time points. For example the cofactor regeneration system cofactor ketoreductase and ketoreductase substrate may be added first to the solvent.

For improved mixing efficiency when an aqueous co solvent system is used the cofactor regeneration system ketoreductase and cofactor may be added and mixed into the aqueous phase first. The organic phase may then be added and mixed in followed by addition of the ketoreductase substrate. Alternatively the ketoreductase substrate may be premixed in the organic phase prior to addition to the aqueous phase

Suitable conditions for carrying out the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction reactions described herein include a wide variety of conditions which can be readily optimized by routine experimentation that includes but is not limited to contacting the engineered ketoreductase enzyme and substrate at an experimental pH and temperature and detecting product for example using the methods described in the Examples provided herein.

The ketoreductase catalyzed reduction is typically carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 15 C. to about 75 C. For some embodiments the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 20 C. to about 55 C. In still other embodiments it is carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 20 C. to about 45 C. The reaction may also be carried out under ambient conditions.

The reduction reaction is generally allowed to proceed until essentially complete or near complete reduction of substrate is obtained. Reduction of substrate to product can be monitored using known methods by detecting substrate and or product. Suitable methods include gas chromatography HPLC and the like. Conversion yields of the 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester reduction product generated in the reaction mixture are generally greater than about 50 may also be greater than about 60 may also be greater than about 70 may also be greater than about 80 may also be greater than 90 and are often greater than about 97 .

The 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate reduction product can be recovered from the reaction mixture and optionally further purified using methods that are known to those of skill in the art. Suitable methods are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 001 615 6 472 544 6 596 879 and 6 645 746 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additional suitable methods are provided in the Examples below.

As previously discussed the ketoreductase catalyzed reduction of the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate ester enantiomer Ia generates a new stereogenic carbon at the 3 position of the 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate ester product.

As mentioned above the ketoreductase reactions described herein typically generate chiral syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate esters according to structural formula IIa having a diastereomeric purity of at least about 99.5 usually at least about 99.9 and typically at least about 99.95 .

To an 1 L 3 neck flask with an addition funnel and a PTFE coated magnetic stirring bar under a nitrogen atmosphere and immersed in a 20 C. dry ice acetone bath was added 120 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 75 mL 540 mmol diisopropylamine. The solution was stirred and cooled to 20 C. and 200 mL 500 mmol 2.5 M n butyllithium in hexane was added dropwise over 45 minutes giving a pale yellow solution. After an additional 30 minutes 70 mL 520 mmol t butyl acetate was added dropwise with stirring over 25 minutes turning the solution cloudy. After an additional 1 hour maintained at 20 C. a solution of 22.0 g ethyl 4 cyano 3R hydroxybutyrate 99.9 e.e. 140 mmol in 30 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise with stirring over 35 minutes giving a pale yellow solution.

The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with 250 mL toluene. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 mL 1 N HCl followed by 3 100 mL of distilled water. The final water wash gave pH 5. The solvent was removed from the organic phase by rotary evaporation at 60 C. under vacuum to give 31.7 g of a yellow oil.

This and similarly prepared crude t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate typically having purity ranging from 60 to 75 weight the balance being t butyl 3 oxobutyrate and t butyl 4 cyano 3R hydroxybutyrate were used in the following Examples except when the purified substrate is specified. The specified amounts of t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate used in the Examples refer to the amount of the crude preparation uncorrected for its actual composition.

An LC MS MS method was developed to analyze the conversion of t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate to t butyl 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate and the possible conversion of t butyl 3 oxobutyrate in the crude substrate Example 4 to t butyl 3 hydroxybutyrate 

The response ratio for t butyl 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate to t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate substrate was typically 0.84 at 0.1 mg ml. The MS MS transitions for t butyl 3 oxobutyrate and t butyl 3 hydroxybutyrate were not optimized.

An LC MS MS method was developed to separate and analyze the 3R 5R and 3S 5R diastereomers of t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate. The LC conditions provided baseline resolution of the diastereomers. The response was linear from 0.0001 to 1.0 mg ml with a detection limit under 0.0001 mg ml.

A GC MS method was developed to separate and analyze the 4R 6R and 4S 6R diastereomers of t butyl 6R cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4 acetate 

To a 30 mg sample comprising t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate was added 1 mL of ethyl acetate 200 L of 2 2 dimethoxypropane and 20 L of methanesulfonic acid. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at room temperature. After addition of 200 L of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate a sample of the top ethyl acetate layer was analyzed by the method of Example 6.

Each of the 3R 5R and 3S 5R diastereomers of t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate are quantitatively derivatized under these conditions. Accordingly the 3 5R diastereomeric composition of the t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate corresponds to the analyzed 4 6R diastereomeric composition of the 6R cyanomethyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxane 4 acetate derivative.

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours then extracted with 1 mL ethyl acetate. After centrifugation the organic phase was separated and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to leave a nonvolatile oil. The nonvolatile oil was analyzed by the method of Example 4 for the conversion of the t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate and if present the diastereomeric composition of the product t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate by the method of Example 7. The analyses showed 85 conversion of the t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate to produce t butyl 6 cyano 3R 5R dihydroxyhexanoate having 99 d.e.

To a reaction mixture of 1 mL 100 mM triethanolamine chloride buffer pH 7.0 100 L butyl acetate 20 mg t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate 1 mg NAD P and 35 mg glucose was added 3 mg of glucose dehydrogenase powder and 20 mg ketoreductase powder comprising ketoreductase YDL. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 hours then extracted with 1 mL ethyl acetate. After centrifugation the organic phase was separated and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to leave a nonvolatile oil. The nonvolatile oil was analyzed by the method of Example 4 for the conversion of the t butyl 6 cyano 5R hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate and if present the diastereomeric composition of the product t butyl 6 cyano 3 5R dihydroxyhexanoate by the method of Example 5.

Note The 4R 6S diastereomer has the same retention time as its 4S 6R enantiomer and the 4S 6S diastereomer has the same retention time as its 4R 6R enantiomer.

In combination with the preceding Example this Example illustrates an engineered ketoreductase having stereospecificity for reduction of the R enantiomer of t butyl 6 cyano 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate over the S enantiomer.

Further when the 5 hydroxy 3 oxohexanoate substrate is prepared from a 3 hydroxybutyrate ester as exemplified in Example 3 a higher degree of stereopurity in the syn 3 5 dihydroxyhexanoate product can be obtained in net from 3 hydroxybutyrate ester of lower stereopurity.

Upon hydrolysis of the lactone R R R 2 4 fluorophenyl dihydroxy 5 1 methylethyl 3 phenyl 4 phenylamino carbonyl 1H pyrrole 1 heptanoic acid sodium salt atorvastatin sodium salt is formed.

Upon completion of hydrolysis add 10 L HO then wash at least two times with a 1 1 mixture of EtOAc hexane. Each wash should contain 10 L each of EtOAc hexane. If sodium salt is pure add 15 L of methanol. If it is impure and or contains color add 100 g of G 60 charcoal stir for two hours filter over supercel and then wash with 15 L MeOH. Perform an analysis on the reaction mixture by HPLC to determine the exact amount of the sodium salt of atorvastatin that is in the aqueous methanol solution.

Dissolve 1 equivalent or slight excess of CaCl.2HO 73.5 g in 20 L HO. Heat both the CaClsolution and the aqueous methanol solution to 60 C. Add the CaClsolution slowly with high agitation to the 60 C. aqueous methanol solution of atorvastatin sodium salt. After complete addition cool the mixture slowly to 15 C. and filter the precipitating calcium salt of formula VIII. Wash the filter cake with 5 L HO. Dry at 50 C. in a vacuum oven.

The calcium salt from the dried filter cake can be recrystallized by dissolving in 4 L of EtOAc 50 C. filtering over Supercel washing the filtrate with 1 L EtOAc 50 C. then adding 3 L of a nonpolar solvent such as hexane to the 50 C. EtOAc solution. The resulting crystals of formula VIII are then dried by air or with heating.

In an aerated agitated 15 L fermenter 6.0 L of growth medium containing 0.88 g L ammonium sulfate 0.98 g L of sodium citrate 12.5 g L of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate trihydrate 6.25 g L of potassium dihydrogen phosphate 6.2 g L of Tastone 154 yeast extract 0.083 g L ferric ammonium citrate and 8.3 ml L of a trace element solution containing 2 g L of calcium chloride dihydrate 2.2 g L of zinc sulfate septahydrate 0.5 g L manganese sulfate monohydrate 1 g L cuprous sulfate heptahydrate 0.1 g L ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 0.02 g L sodium tetraborate decahydrate was brought to a temperature of 30. The fermenter was inoculated with a late exponential culture of W3110 containing a plasmid with the ketoreductase gene of interest grown in a shake flask as described in Example 3 to a starting ODof 0.5 to 2.0. The fermenter was agitated at 500 1500 rpm and air was supplied to the fermentation vessel at 1.0 15.0 L min to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of 30 saturation or greater. The pH of the culture was controlled at 7.0 by addition of 20 v v ammonium hydroxide. Growth of the culture was maintained by the addition of a feed solution containing 500 g L cerelose 12 g L ammonium chloride and 10.4 g L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate. After the culture reached an ODof 50 the expression of ketoreductase was induced by the addition of isopropyl b D thiogalactoside IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was grown for another 14 hours. The culture was then chilled to 4 C. and maintained at 4 C. until harvested. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 G for 40 minutes in a Sorval RC12BP centrifuge at 4 C. Harvested cells were used directly in the following downstream recovery process or were stored at 4 C. until such use.

The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of 100 mM triethanolamine chloride buffer pH 6.8 at 4 C. to each volume of wet cell paste. The intracellular ketoreductase was released from the cells by passing the suspension through a homogenizer fitted with a two stage homogenizing valve assembly using a pressure of 12000 psig. The cell homogenate was cooled to 4 C. immediately after disruption. A solution of 10 w v polyethyleneimine pH 7.2 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.5 w v and stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 5000 G in a standard laboratory centrifuge for 30 minutes. The clear supernatant was decanted and concentrated ten fold using a cellulose ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 30 Kd. The final concentrate was dispensed into shallow containers frozen at 20 C. and lyophilized to powder. The ketoreductase powder was stored at 80 C.
