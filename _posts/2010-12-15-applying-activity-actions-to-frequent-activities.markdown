title: Applying activity actions to frequent activities
abstract: Activities of users of a service often involve one or more resources, such as uploading or downloading files in a file system of an FTP server. The activities of the users may be tracked and recorded in an activity log in order to identify frequently performed activities involving particular resources, and for such frequently performed activities, one or more activity actions may be performed. For example, malicious users may upload or utilize an equivalent set of assets stored in several accounts. The frequency of these undesirable activities may be identified, and an activity action may be automatically applied to the users (e.g., banning accounts), resources (e.g., deleting assets), and/or activities (e.g., blocking access to the resources). Conversely, desirable activities involving particular resources may be similarly detected, and the activity action applied to such desirable activities may involve reporting the desirable activity to an administrator of the service.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a set of users who may perform various activities involving one or more resources. As a first example users of a network file system may access various files such as creating reading altering deleting naming or renaming and executing various files. As a second example users of a media sharing service may upload download view or share with other users one or more media objects such as documents images and audio and or video recordings. As a third example users of a social media network may author messages referencing various resources such as internet accessible resources identified by a uniform resource identifier URI . The resources involved in such activities may be stored by a device e.g. a file server permitting users to perform various activities on files stored therein . Alternatively users may perform activities involving resources that are not stored by the device such as URIs of resources stored by other devices e.g. references to external resources such as web pages provided by a website or objects stored by other object servers .

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In scenarios where users perform activities involving one or more resources it may be desirable to identify frequent activities. Some such activities may comprise desirable or undesirable activities e.g. sharing an unrestricted recording of a song with a friend or sharing a restricted recording in a manner contrary with the restriction . Accordingly it may be desirable to configure a device such as a file server a media sharing service or a webserver to monitor the activities of users to detect frequent activities that involve a particular set of resources e.g. frequent uploads of a particular file or set of files stored by a fileserver frequent viewing of a particular media item shared by a media sharing service and or frequent referencing of a particular resource within messages sent to other users . Such monitoring may be advantageous in order to apply an activity action in response to a frequent activity. As a first example if an embodiment detects among a set of users a frequent and desirable activity the embodiment may automatically identify the activity as popular among users. As a second example if an embodiment detects among a set of users a frequent but undesirable activity e.g. sending spam email messages or email messages including or referencing malware the embodiment may automatically restrict the activity e.g. by blocking the performance of the activity the user s performing the activity e.g. by suspending or banning users and or the resource s involved in the activity e.g. by blocking access to or deleting such resource s . In this manner an embodiment of these techniques may automatically or with the assistance of a user apply suitable activity actions in response to frequent activities performed by the users involving one or more resources.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a set of users who may perform one or more activities involving one or more resources. As a first example users of a file system such as a set of users of the local file system of a computer a set of users accessing files in a network file system or a set of users accessing a remote file server such as a File Transfer Protocol FTP server or a webserver may perform various activities relating to one or more files such as creating reading altering deleting naming or renaming relocating or executing one or more files. As a second example users of a media sharing service such as an image database a database of documents or an audio and or video streaming service may perform various activities relating to media objects such as uploading downloading streaming or deleting a media object. As a third example users of a social media network may perform various activities relating to objects shared with other users such as posting public or private messages addressed to one or more contacts that may include a reference such as a uniform resource identifier URI to one or more objects such as a web page of a website. In these and other examples a device offering a service to such users may be configured to receive requests from the users to perform various activities and may perform such activities with respect to one or more resources on behalf of the users.

The exemplary scenario of involves the recording of activities . These records may be examined e.g. by an administrator of the device in order to monitor the interactions of users with the service . This monitoring may facilitate the administrator in improving the quality of the service e.g. by identifying performance bottlenecks or opportunities for upgrading the device and or in noticing and evaluating undesirable activities by malicious users e.g. by tracking the activities performed on the resources of the service by the malicious user . However in many scenarios such as a conventional webserver the device is not configured to evaluate the activity requested by the user . Rather the device may be configured only to record the activity and to perform the requested action on behalf of the user .

However it may be desirable to configure the device to evaluate the patterns of activities performed with respect to one or more resources and to automatically perform one or more actions in response to a frequently performed activity involving a particular set of resources . The activities may comprise a desirable activity such as users sharing a popular media object in a media sharing service or undesirable activity such as users uploading an objectionable content item such as an inappropriate photo or a malicious piece of software such as a propagating virus or worm. The device may therefore be configured to upon detecting a particularly frequent activity involving a particular set of resources automatically perform an action in response to the activity . As a first example for a desirable activity such as a frequent sharing of a popular media object the device may perform an action that encourages the activity such as adding the media object to a list of popular media objects stored by the service improving performance by allocating additional resources for the sharing of the media object e.g. storing the media object in a high performance cache or rewarding the user s performing the activity . Conversely for an undesirable activity such as the uploading or accessing of an undesirable object the device may detect the frequency of such activities and may apply one or more activity actions that discourage the undesirable activity . Such activity actions may be performed upon the users performing the activity e.g. warning or banning the users performing the activity the resources involved in the activity e.g. censoring restricting access to replacing or deleting the resource and or the activity e.g. blocking attempts to perform the activity or degrading the performance of the device in performing the activity . Such activity actions may also be applied proactively presently retroactively e.g. for an activity involving the uploading of an undesirable resource the device may retroactively ban the accounts of users who have previously performed the activity may ban the users currently performing the activity and or may monitor future requests of the users in order to ban the account of a user requesting the activity promptly upon receiving the request. In these and other scenarios it may be desirable to configure a device to detect frequently performed activities by users involving particular resources of the service and to perform one or more activity actions in response to such activities .

In this and other scenarios the device may be configured to in accordance with the technique presented herein identify frequent activities involving particular resources and perform one or more activity actions relating thereto. For example upon receiving a request from a user to perform an activity involving one or more resources the device may create a record in an activity log that denotes the user the activity requested and the resources involved in the activity . The device may then evaluate the activity log to identify frequent activities . For example the store activity of the third user and the fourth user may qualify as a frequent activity and the device may therefore perform one or more activity actions to this frequent activity . In this exemplary scenario the frequent activity performed by the third user and the fourth user may comprise an undesirable activity and the device may upon identifying the frequent activity automatically perform an activity action in response to the frequent activity . For example an activity action may be defined to ban from the service the users performing the frequent activity . This activity action may be applied retroactively e.g. after identifying that some users have previously attempted to perform the frequent activity the device may ban users who have previously performed the frequent activity presently e.g. banning users who are currently performing the frequent activity and or proactively e.g. after identifying the frequent activity monitoring the activities of users to detect an attempt to perform the frequent activity and therefore banning the user . In this manner the device may detect frequent activities and automatically apply activity actions thereto in accordance with the techniques presented herein. Moreover the device selectively applies the activity actions to users performing the activity involving the particular resources . For example the third user and the fourth user are subjected to the activity action because the combination of the activity and the involved resources raises a suspicion whereas the second user performing a similar activity but only involving one of these resources which does not raise suspicion is not subjected to the activity action . In accordance this example and the techniques presented herein the device may be capable of identifying new types of activities that are involved in new patterns of attack by malicious users and may automatically and rapidly generate new rules that defend against such attacks by applying activity actions to the frequent activities identified as malicious.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of evaluating activities of users involving resources such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for evaluating activities of users involving resources such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a non transitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be utilized in relation to track and evaluate various types of activities preformed on the resources of various types of services . As a first such variation the device may comprise a data store such as a file system or a database storing various resources such as files or database records and the activity may involve sending a resource to the service . As a second such variation the device may be capable of executing various instructions on behalf of a user such as a compiled binary or a script and the activity may involve executing particular instructions such as attempting to access unauthorized resources such as reading a password file or deleting a system object . For example these techniques may be utilized to evaluate various activities performed on files of a file system such as creating reading updating deleting naming or relocating the file various actions performed on media objects of a media sharing service such as uploading downloading streaming commenting on or removing a media object and various activities performed on messages of a social network such as creating reading replying to or deleting a message. Additionally the activities monitored by an embodiment may be desirable e.g. a first user sharing a media object with a second user undesirable e.g. a user executing a decryption utility against an encrypted resource of the service or simply interesting or unusual e.g. users frequently uploading a file of unknown contents and usage to a file server . As a second example the device whereupon these techniques are performed may comprise a single machine or may be distributed across multiple machines in various ways e.g. two or more machines may be configured to store the activity log evaluate the activities included in the activity log and or apply the activity actions in response to detected activities . As a third example these techniques may be utilized to apply many types of activity actions upon identifying a frequent activity involving one or more particular resources . Such activity actions may apply to the user performing the activity e.g. warning the user that the activity is undesirable or banning the account of the user to the resources involved in the activity e.g. deleting resources involved in an undesirable activity and or to the activity e.g. blocking attempts or requests to perform the activity .

A particular scenario wherein these techniques may be utilized involves a frequent tactic of malicious users such as distributors of spam and malicious software such as viruses and worms unauthorized infiltrators of computer systems and operators of botnets of corrupted devices. Such malicious users often perform malicious activities by invoking a set of resources stored on a service . For example a spammer may store an email template a database of targeted email addresses and an application designed to send unsolicited bulk email messages a distributor of malicious software may store the malicious software and a mechanism for delivering the malicious software e.g. a corrupted user control that may exploit a vulnerability in a webserver to install malicious software and an operator of a botnet may store a list of network addresses of co opted devices and various objects for distributing commands to the botnet such as an encryption key to authenticate the operator of the botnet to the co opted devices. Such users may store these assets as resources within one or more independent services such as a public file server a public webserver or a public media object server and may utilize the bandwidth storage and computational capabilities of these independent services to perform some or all of the actions of the malicious activities . However such users are often aware that authorities including the administrators of the service may attempt to block such malicious activities by identifying and removing the resources comprising the assets of the user .

A frequent tactic utilized by malicious users to evade detection involves registering many user accounts on a service and redundantly storing or utilizing the entire set of assets or a subset thereof in each user account. For example if the malicious activity involves three different resources the malicious user may store all three resources in many user accounts or may store each of the first resource the second resource and the third resource as individual resources in many user accounts. The redundant use of many user accounts may allow the malicious user to continue performing the malicious activity even if some of the user accounts are disabled and some resources are removed. Additionally the malicious user may vary the contents of a resource e.g. by creating many versions of a template of a spam email message that differ in insignificant ways so that even if a particular resource is identified as an asset used in a malicious activity . Therefore techniques devised to detect patterns of malicious activity that consider only the contents of the resources may be unable to detect malicious activities designed in a more sophisticated and robust manner. Finally even if an automated detection of malicious activity may be effectively achieved the blocking of such malicious activities may be inadequate if the response to such detected malicious activity involves the review and or intervention of a user such as an administrator of the service . For example a malicious user may be able to create user accounts and upload resources to a service at least as quickly as the administrator of the service may detect and disable such services . However less sophisticated automated techniques may be less capable of distinguishing legitimate and desirable activities from malicious and undesirable activities . For example an automated technique only focuses on the resources used in a malicious activity but if a malicious user may utilize a particular resource such as a decryption utility the automated technique may incorrectly ban other users who legitimately invoke the decryption utility.

The techniques presented herein may be particularly effective for detecting and remediating the malicious activities involving these tactics. This effectiveness may derive from the identification of frequent patterns of activity based on the activities as well as the particular resources involved because a malicious activity may involve a set of otherwise legitimate activities performed on an otherwise legitimate set of resources . For example a first set of users may as a first activity involving a first resource receive and store a spam email message that is sent to the email account of the user and may as a second activity involving a second resource invoke a sendmail utility to send legitimate email messages to other users. However a second set of users may as a third activity involving the first resource and the second resource invoke the sendmail utility to send the spam email message to spam recipients. By evaluating the combination of the activity and the resources involved the techniques presented herein may automatically identify the malicious frequent activity and ban the second group of users but not the legitimate frequent activity of the first group of users . However those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the detection of activities involving particular resources and the recording of such activities in an activity log . As a first example the identification of an activity and one or more resources may be performed in various ways. One embodiment of these techniques may generate a signature of various activities and or resources such as a hashcode of respective objects utilized by an activity in order to track the identification thereof. The embodiment may therefore record an activity by computing a signature such as a hashcode generated by a hashcode generator of the activity and the at least one resource and recording the user and the activity in the activity log . This general purpose technique may be applied uniformly regardless of the type of activity and or resource . However some users may disguise the activities and or resources from such detection by introducing non significant differences. In a first such variation different types of activity may be performed that differ in non substantive ways in order to avoid detection but that involve the same result. For example a malicious user may generate many variations of a maliciously crafted script and a polymorphic virus may make significant alterations to the code. In a second such variation the resources utilized by the activity may also be altered in many ways such as generating many versions of a template of a spam email message or by encoding an image included in a spam email message using a variety of image encoding algorithms. Therefore rather than directly computing a signature of an activity and or resource if a resource is of an identifiable resource type an embodiment may compute the signature as a content fingerprint that may identify significant features of the resource regardless of non significant alterations or variations. The embodiment may therefore record an activity by invoking a content fingerprint generator to generate a content fingerprint for respective resources based on the resource type of the resource and storing the content fingerprint.

As a second example of this second aspect the activity log may be implemented in many ways. As a first such variation the activity log may comprise a text document comprising records stored as text as in a conventional server log or a database storing records comprising records in a database table. As a second such variation the embodiment may include an activity index generator such as a hashcode generator and respective activities involving particular resources may be stored in the activity log in an indexed manner according to an activity index computed by the activity index generator for the activity and or the resources utilized. The implementation of the activity log as an index may facilitate the rapid storage and evaluation of activities and or resources .

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the evaluation of the activities involving one or more resources in order to identify frequent activities performed by the users . As a first example the evaluation may be performed continuously e.g. by a process that continuously examines and identifies the activities of the users in order to identify trendingly frequent activities . Alternatively the evaluation may be performed periodically e.g. at an evaluation frequency defined by the device e.g. an hourly or daily evaluation of activities . As a second example of this third aspect the identification of a frequent activity among the activities performed by the users may be defined by the device . For example an embodiment may for particular activities record an activity counter comprising the detected number of times the activity has been performed involving a particular set of resources . The embodiment may therefore upon detecting a request to perform the activity increment the activity counter for the activity and may identify frequent activities as those having activity counters that exceed an activity threshold defined by the embodiment e.g. an activity may be identified as a frequent activity if more than one hundred requests to perform the activity are received within an hour .

As a third example of this third aspect the storage and or evaluation of activities may be distributed over many components such as many computers comprising a server farm or various software processes in a multitasking system. As a first such variation the activity log may be stored on two or more machines redundantly e.g. such that a particular activity is recorded on two or more machines or storage devices and or distributively e.g. the activity log comprises a first set of activities recorded on a first machine or storage device and a second set of activities recorded on a second machine or storage device . As a second variation the evaluation of activities recorded in an activity log may be distributed across several machines such that a first machine evaluates a first set of activities and a second machine evaluates a second set of activities . As a third variation the application of activity actions in response to frequent activities may be distributed across several machines. These distribution techniques may be advantageous e.g. for scaling up the evaluation of activities and application of activity actions to identify frequent activities among a large set of activities performed by the users of the service . For example respective components may be assigned to evaluate a particular subset of activities which may improve the scalability of the evaluation of a large set of activities . An activity may therefore be evaluated by first identifying the component assigned to evaluate such activities and by invoking the component to evaluate the activity .

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the application of activity actions in response to respective activities . As a first example with respect to a particular activity performed by a user and involving at least one resource an activity action may be applied against the user performing the frequent activity e.g. restricting the user account of the user by warning or banning the users performing the frequent activity the at least one resource involved in the frequent activity e.g. restricting the resource by censoring restricting access to replacing or deleting the resource and or the frequent activity e.g. blocking attempts to perform the frequent activity or degrading the performance of the device in performing the frequent activity . Such activity actions may also be applied retroactively presently or proactively e.g. for a frequent activity involving the uploading of an undesirable resource the device may retroactively ban the accounts of users who have previously performed the frequent activity may ban users who are currently performing the frequent activity and or may monitor future requests of the users in order to ban the account of a user requesting the frequent activity promptly upon receiving the request. Alternatively the device may periodically review the frequent activities e.g. once per week and may ban the accounts of any users found to have performed the frequent activity during the preceding period.

A particular variation of this first example relates to malicious users who utilize automated utilities to perform many malicious activities quickly such as using scripts or bots that interact with the service in an automated manner. In such scenarios where a frequent action is detected that might be performed by an automated process the activity action may restrict the users performing the frequent activity by presenting to the user a user challenge that is configured to authenticate the user as a human actor e.g. a captcha user challenge such as an image of symbols positioned over a noisy background that is difficult for an automated process to evaluate such that a user who correctly identifies the symbols is likely to be a human actor . The embodiment may perform the requested activity on behalf of the user only if the user submits a user challenge response that satisfies the user challenge. If the user fails to submit a correct user challenge response the embodiment may permit the user to try again may simply refuse to perform the requested activity or may restrict or ban the account of the user .

As a second example of this fourth aspect the activity action may involve notifying a user of the device e.g. an administrator of the service of the frequent activity . For example the embodiment may generate a notification for the user indicating the frequent activity and the resources involved in the activity and also possibly including other information such as the user accounts of the users performing the frequent activity the dates and times of the frequent activities the internet protocol IP addresses of such users and any other activities performed by these users . The embodiment may actively notify the user e.g. by presenting a pop up notification for the user in an administrative interface and or passively notify the user e.g. by sending an email message or by presenting the notification only upon the request of the user .

As a further variation of this second example the embodiment may also present to the user at least one suggested activity action that is recommended for application to the frequent activity . For example if the frequent activity is likely to be desirable the embodiment may present to the user a set of activity actions that encourage the frequent activity such as identifying the frequent action to other users of the service e.g. including a frequently viewed media object in a list of media objects recommended to users of a media sharing service or rewarding the users performing the frequent action . If the frequent activity is likely to be undesirable the embodiment may present to the user a set of activity actions that discourage the frequent activity such as warning or banning the user s performing the frequent activity or blocking the performance of the frequent activity . If the nature of the frequent activity is indeterminate the embodiment may present a range of suggestions to the user and or may offer to perform a further evaluation of the frequent activity e.g. a more sophisticated analysis of resources involved in the frequent activity the other activities of the users performing the frequent activity and or the consequences of the frequent activity or simply to continue monitoring and reporting on the frequent activity .

As a still further variation of this second example an embodiment may allow the user to select from the suggested activity actions an activity action to be applied to the frequent activity and may apply the selected activity action to the frequent activity possibly including the activity action for application to future attempts by users to perform the frequent activity . In this manner the device may include the interaction of a user such as an administrator of the service in determining the activity actions to be automatically applied to a frequent activity . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many types of activity actions and applications to frequent activities while implementing the techniques presented herein.
