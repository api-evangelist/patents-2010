The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to personal data assistants PDAs and in particular to ruggedized personal data assistants RPDAs .

PDAs also known as palmtop computers are small light weight computers that may be held in one s palm. A PDA may be only a few inches wide for example 2 5 inches. A PDA may include a visual display. The visual display may be a touchscreen. The PDA may include a stylus for touching the touchscreen. The PDA housing may include a groove for storing the stylus when not in use. A PDA may include a variety of interfaces for connecting to external devices. One interface may be an interface for powering the PDA and or charging batteries in the PDA. Another interface may be a serial data port for example an RS 232 Recommended Standard 232 port or a USB Universal Serial Bus port. Further interfaces may include card slots such as PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association slots.

An RPDA is a PDA that is designed for more rugged use. An RPDA may have a housing made of a strong and durable material. Compared to PDAs RPDAs may be more shock resistant more waterproof better able to withstand temperature extremes and less prone to malfunction from electromagnetic interference. schematically shows an RPDA having a touchscreen a housing a pair of PCMCIA slots and a stylus grooves and formed in housing for storing stylus a serial data port and a direct current power connection .

RPDA may be a component of a portable fire control apparatus for indirect fire weapons. An example of a portable fire control apparatus for indirect fire weapons is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 698 983 issued on Apr. 20 2010 to Pinto Schneck Alameda and Coradeschi. RPDA may communicate digitally to a Single Channel Ground Airborne Radio System SINCGARS radio via a wired connection. To communicate with a SINCGARS radio RPDA may include radio interface hardware connected to RPDA via for example PCMCIA slot . Radio interface hardware may be housed in housing fixed to RPDA . Housing may include connector for connecting with a SINCGARS digital communication cable . Radio interface hardware and housing may be available from Elbit Systems of America McLean Va.

A problem with the configuration of is that users of RPDA may often use cable as a handle for lifting holding and moving RPDA . Thus cable and its connections to RPDA may become stressed and fatigued and may ultimately fail. The jacket of power cable at power input connection of RPDA may rip or tear. The screws used to fix serial data cable to data port of RPDA may be lost resulting in a partial or complete loss of connection between cable and RPDA .

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for securely connecting multiple cables to an RPDA.

One aspect of the invention is an adapter for a ruggedized personal digital assistant RPDA . The RPDA may have a groove for storing a stylus a power in port and a serial data port.

The first leg may have a generally tubular shape and may include a protruding ridge that is slidable in the groove of the RPDA. The bottom of the first leg may include a connector for a multi function cable. The top of the first leg may include an opening for a communication cable.

The second leg may include a through hole for receiving a thumbscrew. The top of the second leg may include a power connector for engaging the power in port of the RPDA and a serial data connector for engaging the serial data port of the RPDA. A thumbscrew may be disposed in the through hole in the second leg for threadingly engaging an opening in the RPDA adjacent the power in port.

The adapter may include a multi function cable assembly disposed in the first leg and connected to the multi function cable connector. The multi function cable assembly may split into first second and third cables in the first leg. The first cable may extend through the opening in the top of the first leg. The second cable may connect to the power connector in the second leg. The third cable may connect to the serial data connector in the second leg.

The protruding ridge on the first leg may include a bulbous edge. The side of the first leg opposite the side having the protruding ridge may include a strap fixed thereon. The strap may be fixed to a pair of spaced apart projections. Each of the spaced apart projections may include an opening therein for receiving the strap.

The RPDA may have a groove for storing a stylus a power in port and a serial data port. The adapter may include a generally L shaped housing having a first leg and a second leg. The first leg may have a generally tubular shape and may include a protruding ridge that slidably engages the groove of the RPDA. The bottom of the first leg may include a connector for a multi function cable. The top of the first leg may include an opening for a communication cable.

A further aspect of the invention is an adapter for a ruggedized personal digital assistant RPDA . The RPDA may have a groove for storing a stylus a power in port and a serial data port. The adapter may include a generally L shaped housing having a first leg and a second leg. The first leg may have substantially planar exterior and interior surfaces. The interior surface may include a protruding ridge that is slidable in the groove of the RPDA. The bottom of the second leg may include a connector for a multi function cable. The second leg may include a through hole for receiving a thumbscrew.
