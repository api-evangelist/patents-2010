The present invention relates to an ultrasonic inspection device and an ultrasonic inspection method which are one type of nondestructive inspection techniques. The invention more particularly relates to an ultrasonic inspection device that includes an array type ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic inspection method in which an array type ultrasonic probe is used.

In recent years constructional materials and the like are inspected by an ultrasonic inspection method. Such a method having being developed more accurately generates an image inside of an object to be inspected in a short time to inspect the inside of the object as typified by a phased array method and an aperture synthesis method refer to for example Non Patent Document 1 Digital signal processing series volume 12 Digital signal processing with measurement sensor pp 143 186 issued by Shokodo written by Michimasa Kondo Yukimasa Ohashi and Akio Jitsumori .

The phased array method is based on a principle in which an array type ultrasonic probe having a plurality of piezoelectric elements is used and wavefronts of ultrasonic waves transmitted from the piezoelectric elements interfere with each other to form a synthesized wavefront that propagates. Thus in the phased array method timings of transmission of ultrasonic waves from the piezoelectric elements are controlled to delay so that timing of each transmission is shifted thereby enabling control on incident angles of the ultrasonic waves and also focusing of the ultrasonic waves. For reception of ultrasonic waves incident angles of ultrasonic waves that are reflected and received by the piezoelectric elements are shifted in timing and is summed thereby enabling control on the incident angles to be formed when the ultrasonic waves are received and also reception of the ultrasonic waves in focused state as is the case with the transmission.

A linear scanning method and a sector scanning method are generally known as the phased array method. The linear scanning method is such that piezoelectric elements for a one dimensional array probe linearly scan an object to be inspected. The sector scanning method is such that a direction in which an ultrasonic wave is transmitted or received is changed within a fan shaped region. If a two dimensional array probe that has piezoelectric elements arranged in a matrix pattern is used ultrasonic waves can be three dimensionally focused on any position and thereby scanning suitable for an object to be inspected can be performed. Each of the two methods allows ultrasonic waves to be scanned at high speed without moving the ultrasonic probe. Also each of the two methods allows incident angles of ultrasonic waves and the vertical position at a focal point thereof to be controlled without replacing the ultrasonic probe. These methods are techniques which enable inspection to be performed at high speed with high accuracy.

The aperture synthesis method is based on the following principle when a piezoelectric element transmits an ultrasonic wave in such a manner that the ultrasonic wave spreads in an object to be inspected and the piezoelectric element receives the reflected ultrasonic wave a defect that is the source from which the received reflected ultrasonic wave derives is present on a circular arc that has a center thereof at the position of the piezoelectric element that transmitted and received the ultrasonic wave and has a radius of a distance that the reflected ultrasonic wave propagates. The piezoelectric element transmits an ultrasonic wave and receives the reflected ultrasonic wave while the position of the piezoelectric element is sequentially changed. The ultrasonic waves received by the piezoelectric element at the positions are calculated by an electronic computer so that the ultrasonic waves are represented by circular arcs. Intersections on the circular arcs are concentrated at the position of a defect that is the source from which the reflected ultrasonic waves derive whereby the position of the defect is specified. The details of the calculation performed by the electronic computer are described in Non Patent Document 1.

In the methods in which a probe that has a plurality of piezoelectric elements is used the probe can three dimensionally receive an ultrasonic wave signal reflected from a defect without a movement of the probe. However in order to specify the three dimensional position of the defect on the basis of the reflected ultrasonic wave signal the three dimensional position of the defect is estimated on the basis of a two dimensional image having multiple reflection intensity distributions of waves reflected at locations that are spatially different from each other. Alternatively the three dimensional position of the defect is estimated by converting the reflection intensity distributions into three dimensional data and then three dimensionally displaying the three dimensional data.

When the linear scanning method and the sector scanning method based on phased array methods are adopted multiple two dimensional reflection intensity images responsive to known scanning pitches can be acquired. Thus a direction in which a reflected ultrasonic wave appears can be specified by sequentially selectively displaying the two dimensional reflection intensity images on a screen. However these methods have limitations when three dimensional scanning other than the aforementioned scanning is performed.

To cope with this advancement in computer technology in recent years has made available a technique for performing interpolation on ultrasonic wave signals reflected and received from multiple directions so that image data that indicates points three dimensionally arranged in a matrix pattern is generated and displaying the image data by volume rendering or surface rendering. In addition there is a technique for displaying an image as a three dimensional point group without conversion of the reflected ultrasonic wave signals into data that indicates points arranged in a matrix pattern. Since the techniques are designed such that the data is stored as three dimensional inspection data an inspector can confirm the three dimensional inspection data in any direction after the measurement refer to for example Non Patent Document 2 Development of 3 Dimensional Ultrasonic Testing System 3D Focus UT Japan Society of Maintenology The fifth scientific lecture meeting Summary report 155 2008 written by Atsushi Baba So Kitazawa Naoyuki Kono Yuji Adachi Mitsuru Odakura and Osamu Kikuchi and Non Patent Document 3 Potts A McNab A. Reilly D. Toft M. Presentation and analysis enhancements of the NDT Workbench a software package for ultrasonic NDT data REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN QUANTITATIVE NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION Volume 19. AIP Conference Proceedings Volume 509 pp. 741 748 2000 .

However it is difficult to determine only on the basis of such three dimensional inspection data whether or not a wave that corresponds to a peak of a reflection intensity distribution is a wave reflected on an end surface or boundary surface of an object to be inspected or is a wave reflected on a defect. Especially it is difficult even for an experienced inspector to make such a determination for inspection of an object having a complex shape since reflected ultrasonic wave signals shape echoes dependent on the shape of the object appear in great numbers. Thus software has been developed that allows data three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional shape of an object to be inspected to be displayed together with three dimensional inspection data. By overlapping and comparing the two types of the data using this software it is possible to easily determine whether an ultrasonic wave signal is a shape echo or an echo defect echo generated from a defect. Data generated by a general purposed computer aided design CAD system is read and used for three dimensional shape data in many cases refer to for example Non Patent Documents 2 and 3 .

However the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are generated using different coordinate systems. In order to overlap and display the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data it is necessary to perform positioning correction by moving the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data to an appropriate position on a display screen. If the correction is not appropriately performed it is not possible to confirm the correlation between the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data. Thus it is not possible to identify a shape echo and a defect echo. In a conventional technique an inspector performs a positioning correction operation using a display device so as to change coordinate values of the three dimensional inspection data and coordinate values of the three dimensional shape data on the basis of numerical information on the relative positions of a probe and an object to be inspected . This operation is repeatedly performed until identification of a shape echo and a defect echo can be attained it disadvantageously takes much time to identify the echoes.

An object of the present invention is to provide an ultrasonic inspection device and an ultrasonic inspection method which allow position adjustment of three dimensional inspection data and three dimensional shape data to be easily performed on a display screen and allow a defect echo and a shape echo to be quickly identified.

According to the present invention it is possible to easily perform position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data on the display screen and quickly identify a defect echo and a shape echo.

The configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to an embodiment of the present invention are described below with reference to .

First the entire configuration of the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment is described with reference to .

As shown in the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment includes an array type ultrasonic probe a transmitting and receiving unit and a display unit . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits ultrasonic waves so that the ultrasonic waves are incident on an object to be inspected. The display unit displays received signal and an image inspection image on the object to be inspected.

As shown in the array type ultrasonic probe includes a plurality of piezoelectric elements that each generate and receive an ultrasonic wave. The array type ultrasonic probe is placed on a surface hereinafter also referred to as an inspection surface of the object to be inspected. After that the array type ultrasonic probe receives driving signals from the transmitting and receiving unit and generates ultrasonic waves on the basis of the driving signals. Then the array type ultrasonic probe causes the generated ultrasonic waves to propagate in the object to be inspected. The array type ultrasonic probe detects as received signals the waves reflected from the object . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits the received signals to the transmitting and receiving unit . In the array type ultrasonic probe is in direct contact with the object to be inspected. However the array type ultrasonic probe may be in contact with the object through a wedge made of a material through which an ultrasonic wave can pass.

The transmitting and receiving unit causes the array type ultrasonic probe to transmit and receive ultrasonic waves. The transmitting and receiving unit includes a calculator A a delay time controller B a pulser C a receiver D and a data storage unit E. The pulser C supplies driving signals to the array type ultrasonic probe . The receiver D processes signals transmitted from the array type ultrasonic probe .

The calculator A basically includes a CPU A a RAM A and a ROM A. A program that controls the CPU A is written in the ROM A. The CPU A reads necessary external data from the data storage unit E according to the program written in the ROM A. In addition the CPU A receives data from the RAM A executes arithmetic processing on the received data and outputs the processed data to the data storage unit E.

The CPU A controls the delay time controller B the pulser C and the receiver D so that the delay time controller B the pulser C and the receiver D perform necessary operations. The delay time controller B controls the timings of outputting driving signals from the pulser C and the timings of inputting received signals to the receiver D. Thus the array type ultrasonic probe can perform an operation according to a phased array method.

The operation that is performed by the array type ultrasonic probe according to the phased array method is an operation of controlling incident angles of ultrasonic waves and the depth of a point at which the ultrasonic waves are focused transmitting the ultrasonic waves and receiving the reflected ultrasonic waves . Thus the receiver D receives signals from the array type ultrasonic probe and supplies the received signals to the data storage unit E.

As described above in phased array methods various types of scanning can be performed by changing delay times. A linear scanning method in which the ultrasonic waves propagate in parallel in order to acquire two dimensional inspection data is known as one of the phased array methods. In addition a sector scanning method in which the ultrasonic waves propagate within a sector is known as another one of the phased array methods.

For example as shown in scanning is performed to acquire three dimensional inspection data so that the sector is treated as a basic unit and rotated around a central axis of the probe . In addition as shown in scanning is performed to acquire three dimensional inspection data so that the sector is moved in a fan shaped region. Various types of scanning other than the linear scanning and the sector scanning can be performed on the basis of the shape of the object to be inspected.

Signals that are received by performing those types of scanning are transmitted to the data storage unit E stored in the data storage unit E as stored data and transmitted to the calculator A. The calculator A performs on the basis of delay times synthesis processing on the waveforms of the signals received by the piezoelectric elements performs appropriate interpolation on the waveforms of the signals for the incident angles of the respective ultrasonic waves and generates two dimensional inspection data pixel format inspection data including a two dimensional square lattice as a unit or three dimensional inspection data voxel format inspection data including a three dimensional square lattice as a unit . Then the calculator A converts the generated data into an image and causes the display unit to display the image.

The display unit includes a two dimensional display screen B a three dimensional display screen C and a waveform display screen A. The two dimensional inspection data is displayed on the two dimensional display screen B. The three dimensional inspection data is displayed on the three dimensional display screen C. The waveform signals of the ultrasonic waves received by the piezoelectric elements are displayed on the waveform display screen A. In the ultrasonic inspection device includes one display unit . However the waveform display screen A the two dimensional display screen B and the three dimensional display screen C may be included in display units respectively. In this case the display units are separately provided in the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment.

As shown in three dimensional inspection data is displayed on the three dimensional display screen C included in the display unit . A mouse F and a keyboard G are connected to the calculator A. Data can be entered into the calculator A by means of the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the size of an image of the three dimensional inspection data on the display screen is increased or reduced to any size. In addition data can be entered into the calculator A by means of the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the color and transparency of the image of the three dimensional inspection data are optionally changed. The color of the image on the display screen can be changed according to a reflection intensity of wave. In this case an inspector can select a color pattern from among multiple color patterns on the basis of the purpose of use.

Three dimensional writing algorithms that are used to display the three dimensional inspection data are achieved in libraries such as OpenGL registered trademark and DirectX registered trademark . OpenGL and DirectX are industry standard graphics application programming interfaces graphics APIs for graphics applications. When the graphics APIs are used in a program and necessary information such as the shape of an object to be displayed a viewpoint and the position of the object to be displayed is provided the position color transparency and size of the image of the three dimensional inspection data can be selected and the three dimensional inspection data can be displayed on the three dimensional display screen C.

As shown in the display unit can simultaneously display the three dimensional inspection data and three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional display screen C. The three dimensional shape data indicates the shape of the object to be inspected. The inspector can use the mouse F or the keyboard G and enter data so that the color and transparency of an image of the three dimensional shape data are changed. In addition the inspector can enter a value by using the keyboard G or drag the three dimensional shape data by using the mouse F so that the three dimensional shape data can be moved in parallel or rotated on the three dimensional display screen C. In addition the inspector can switch between displaying of the three dimensional shaped data and hiding of the three dimensional shaped data when necessary. Thus the inspector can easily view the three dimensional inspection data even when the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data overlap each other.

When CAD data on the object to be inspected is present as the three dimensional shape data the CAD data can be read from the outside of the calculator A to be displayed. The format of the CAD data is a data format that allows the CAD data to be input and output by commercially available CAD software. For example the format of the CAD data is stereolithography STL format or stand triangulated language STL format. STL formats allow the CAD data to be input and output by many types of CAD software. The format of the CAD data is STL format and represents surfaces of an object by using a group of many triangles. Surface normal vectors of the triangles and coordinate values of the three corners of each of the triangles are written in a STL file. The three dimensional shape data can be easily read from the STL file and displayed using the graphics APIs by writing multiple triangles.

Normally a coordinate system of the three dimensional inspection data is different from that of the three dimensional shape data . Thus when the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are initially displayed the three dimensional inspection data and three dimensional shape data are located at different positions on the three dimensional display screen C as shown in . The inspector can control by trial and error by using the keyboard G and enter values or use the mouse F so that the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are located at desired positions on the three dimensional display screen C. However this operation takes a long time and is cumbersome. A position adjustment process according to the present invention makes this operation easier.

The position adjustment process is performed by the ultrasonic inspection device according to the present embodiment. The process of position adjustment of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data is described below with reference to .

In general in order to appropriately position images of two data pieces a standard coordinate system is set and parallel movements and rotations are performed. The coordinate system of any of the two data pieces is set as the standard coordinate system in many cases. However any coordinate system may be set as the standard coordinate system. The scale sizes of the images of the two data pieces match each other. In order to move the data piece in parallel it is necessary to determine a vector that indicates the amount of the movement and the direction of the movement. In addition in order to rotate the data piece it is necessary to determine a rotational axis and a rotational angle.

In the present embodiment the inspector sets a desired coordinate system on the three dimensional shape data and uses the mouse F or the keyboard G to enter positional information in which the set coordinate system is used as a standard coordinate system so that position adjustment is interactively performed.

The position adjustment process according to the present embodiment is described with reference to . The position adjustment process is performed by the calculator A. Data on the details of the position adjustment process are stored as a program in the ROM A. The CPU A reads necessary external data from the data storage unit E according to the program stored in the ROM A or receives data from the RAM A and executes arithmetic processing on the received data so that an image displayed on the three dimensional display screen C included in the display unit is changed. In this manner the CPU A adjusts the position of the three dimensional inspection data and the position of the three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional display screen C.

In step S the inspector uses the mouse F connected to the calculator A clicks the inspection surface displayed on the three dimensional display screen C and thereby selects the inspection surface that is included in the three dimensional shape data displayed on the three dimensional display screen C. As described above the array type ultrasonic probe has been placed on the inspection surface. The format of the three dimensional shape data is STL format. Thus the displayed three dimensional shape data is constituted by multiple triangles. The inspection surface is also constituted by multiple triangles. Thus the inspection surface is selected by selecting a single triangle by using the mouse F as shown in . The triangle constitutes a part of the inspection surface.

Next in step S the calculator A defines on the basis of the information input in step S a Z direction that is perpendicular to the inspection surface of the three dimensional shape data as shown in . Since the three dimensional inspection data includes positional information on the inspection surface step S can be achieved by simple coordinate conversion.

A surface other than the inspection surface may be selected. When a geometric relationship between a certain surface and the inspection surface is known the certain surface may be selected in step S and a direction that is perpendicular to the certain surface may be defined in step S.

Next in step S the inspector visually confirms on the basis of images redisplayed in step S on the three dimensional display screen C whether or not positive and negative sides of the three dimensional inspection data in the Z direction match positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction . As shown in the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional inspection data in the Z direction are on the opposite side of the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction in some cases. In this case at least one of the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data is not displayed at a desired position.

When the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional inspection data in the Z direction are on the opposite side of the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction the inspector uses the mouse F or the keyboard G to operate a button on the screen in step S. Thus the calculator A rotates the three dimensional shape data 180 degrees with respect to the inspection surface so that the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction are reversed.

When the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional inspection data in the Z direction match the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction in step S or when the positive and negative sides of the three dimensional shape data in the Z direction are reversed in step S the calculator A causes the display unit to redisplay the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data so that a surface that includes an incident point in the three dimensional inspection data matches the inspection surface included in the three dimensional shape data . shows the state in which the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are redisplayed.

Next in step S when the inspector uses the mouse F and clicks to select a predetermined point located on the three dimensional shape data on the three dimensional display screen C the calculator A sets a Z axis that has an origin that is located at the point . The predetermined point is included in the three dimensional shape data and corresponds to a corner of the object to be inspected for example. In addition the calculator A moves the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data in parallel so that an origin of the three dimensional inspection data matches the point . shows the state of the three dimensional display screen C after the parallel movement.

Next in step S the inspector uses the mouse F and clicks to select a predetermined point located on the three dimensional data on the three dimensional display screen C. The point is included in the three dimensional shape data and corresponds to a corner of the object to be inspected for example.

After step S is performed the calculator A sets an X axis that has an origin that is located at the point in step S while the X axis extends on a line that connects the point to the point .

Next in step S the calculator A automatically sets a Y axis so that the X axis set in step S the Z axis set in step S and the Y axis form a right handed coordinate system. In this case the origin of the coordinate system is the point .

In steps S to S the inspector sets the new desired coordinate system on the three dimensional shape data . This coordinate system can be set using the characteristic shape of the object to be inspected as a standard that is used for an actual measurement in the case where data on the position of the array type ultrasonic probe is stored. Normally a corner of the object to be inspected or the like is set as the origin of the coordinate system. In addition normally sides of the object to be inspected which include the corner or the like are set as the X and Y axes. Since the coordinate system is set in the aforementioned manner the inspector sets the position of the array type ultrasonic probe relative to the three dimensional shape data with a feeling similar to that in an actual measurement.

After the coordinate system is set the calculator A rotates the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data relative to the other image around the Z axis on the basis of information that indicates a rotational angle and has been input using the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the calculator A updates the display in step S.

Next in step S the calculator A moves the three dimensional inspection data or the three dimensional shape data in parallel relative to the other data along the X axis the Y axis and the Z axis on the basis of information that indicates the amount of the parallel movement and has been input using the mouse F or the keyboard G so that the calculator A updates the display. Step S may be performed after step S.

Lastly in step S the inspector visually confirms whether or not the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are located at desired positions on the three dimensional display screen C. When the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data are not located at the desired positions steps S and S are repeated.

In the process the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data can be appropriately positioned in an efficient manner.

As described above in the present embodiment it is possible to appropriately position the three dimensional inspection data and the three dimensional shape data on the display screen and quickly identify a defect echo and a shape echo.

Next the configuration and operations of an ultrasonic inspection device according to another embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to .

In the embodiment shown in it is assumed that the three dimensional inspection data is acquired by the phased array method. In the present invention three dimensional inspection data that is acquired by a method other than the phased array method can be used. For example three dimensional inspection data that is acquired by an aperture synthesis method can be used as described below with reference to .

The ultrasonic inspection device shown in according to the present embodiment includes the array type ultrasonic probe the transmitting and receiving unit and the display unit . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits ultrasonic waves so that the ultrasonic waves are incident on the object to be inspected. The display unit displays received signals and an image inspection image on the object to be inspected.

The array type ultrasonic probe has a plurality of piezoelectric elements that each generate and receive an ultrasonic wave as shown in . After the array type ultrasonic probe is placed on the inspection surface of the object the array type ultrasonic probe receives driving signals from the transmitting and receiving unit generates ultrasonic waves on the basis of the driving signals and causes the ultrasonic waves to propagate in the object to be inspected. Then the array type ultrasonic probe detects as received signals the waves reflected from the object . The array type ultrasonic probe transmits the received signals to the transmitting and receiving unit .

The piezoelectric elements included in the array type ultrasonic probe are sequentially driven at predetermined times by means of driving signals transmitted from a driving signal controller through the pulser C. The piezoelectric elements receive as signals the reflected ultrasonic waves that have been transmitted from the piezoelectric elements . The received signals are input to the receiver D. Specifically the piezoelectric elements included in the array type ultrasonic probe receive the reflected waves as much as the total number thereof.

The signals input to the receiver D are sequentially stored in the data storage unit E as storage data. The calculator A converts the waveforms of the waves received by the piezoelectric elements into a three dimensional image by using the storage data and an aperture synthesis method. Then the calculator A causes the display unit to display the three dimensional image.

The calculator A basically includes a CPU A a RAM A and a ROM A. A program that controls the CPU A is written in the ROM A. The CPU A reads necessary external data from the data storage unit E according to the program written in the ROM A. In addition the CPU A receives data from the RAM A executes arithmetic processing on the received data and outputs the processed data to the data storage unit E when necessary.

In this manner the calculator A generates the three dimensional inspection data by using the aperture synthesis method. A method for position adjustment and displaying of the three dimensional inspection data generated using the aperture synthesis method with the three dimensional shape data is the same as or similar to the method described with reference to .

In the present embodiment it is possible to easily adjust the position of the three dimensional inspection data and the position of the three dimensional shape data on the display screen and quickly identify a defect echo and a shape echo.
