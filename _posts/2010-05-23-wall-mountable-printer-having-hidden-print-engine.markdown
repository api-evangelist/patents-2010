This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 014 730 filed on Dec. 20 2004 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 735 994 all of which are herein incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to a wall mountable high speed printer and more particularly to a printer which can print more than 30 pages or more a minute at high quality whilst being capable of blending into the design of a home or office environment.

The following patents or patent applications filed by the applicant or assignee of the present invention are hereby incorporated by cross reference.

With recent trends of incorporating electronic equipment into the deco e of the home and office and the provision of smaller and more compact workstations in office environments it has become necessary to design such equipment to suit such deco e whilst maximising available workspace. With respect to reducing the amount of space occupied by traditional office equipment such as printers wall mountable printers have been proposed. Whilst such proposals have been successful in freeing up the amount of available space by removing the printer from the desktop this has typically resulted in printer units having reduced printing capabilities poor aesthetic appeal and increased complexity for users.

Thus there is a need to provide a wall mountable printer suitable for use in both home and office environments which is capable of blending into the design of the home or work space whilst providing high speed e.g. more than 30 pages per minute ppm and high quality e.g. images of about 1200 dots per inch dpi or more printing capabilities and ease of use.

A frontal view of a printer in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . The printer comprises a body a print media source tray assembly hingedly attached to the body for storing print media to be printed on by the printer a facia hingedly attached to the outer front surface of the source tray assembly a handle provided on an upper outer surface of the source tray assembly for assisting the hinged operation of the source tray assembly from the body and a print media collector which can be extended from the bottom surface of the body for collecting printed media. In combination the source tray assembly the facia and the collector may form part of the body of the printer .

As shown in the facia is hingedly attached to the source tray assembly with hinges which are inset within the rear surface of the facia so as to provide a flush fitting of the facia to the outer surface of the source tray assembly . The facia is hingedly attached to the source tray assembly so as to provide access to a user interface and a data connector of the printer or any other components which may be provided on the outer surface of the source tray assembly . Access is also provided in this way to the inner surface of the facia which has an envelope portion provided thereon. The envelope portion is provided for the housing of pictures photos prints certificates paintings and like ornamentations in the front of the printer for display through a transparent portion or window provided on the outer surface of the facia see . This aspect of the printer will be described in more detail later.

Referring to the print media collector is housed within a rear surface of the body as is a winding arrangement and associated motor provided to drive the extension and retraction of the collector out from and into the bottom surface of the body . As shown in whilst the collector is substantially housed in the body in its retracted position a retaining portion of the collector is provided outside of the bottom surface of the body . Even so when not being used to collect printed media the collector is housed within the body so as to be barely noticeable from the front of the mounted printer since the collector is substantially hidden by the body itself with the collector on the rear surface of the body which faces a wall or other substantially vertical surface to which the printer is mounted. In order to mount the printer to a wall etc mounting bosses may be provided see which will be described in more detail later.

As can be seen from the bottom top and side views of and respectively the printer comprising of the above mentioned components is relatively compact. As such when mounted to a wall etc the printer projects a minimal distance therefrom which minimises the amount of space occupied by the printer . This compactness is further facilitated by the retractable extendable collector which is extended from the printer when printing is being performed and is retracted within the body when not in use. Further by providing the facia which is able to receive prints etc on the front surface of the tray assembly the actual printer itself can be substantially hidden or disguised from view when not printing as will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description.

An exploded view of the printer is provided in illustrating the various components thereof. As can be seen the printer is basically constructed as an assembly of the body the source tray assembly the facia and the collector with their associated components such as a print engine assembly for printing on print media sourced from the source tray assembly and a power supply unit PSU for powering the print engine assembly and other electronics of the printer which are both housed within the body as further shown in .

Referring to the source tray assembly is arranged to be capable of storing print media for printing in a paper tray portion thereof. The print media may be provided in the form of variously sized print media stacks each comprising of about 250 sheets and up to 500 sheets i.e. a ream of paper of up to 300 gsm paper. For example in A4 paper is held by the source tray assembly . However photographic print media e.g. 4 6 paper and other media may be held. In the following description the print media for use in the printer is referred to as paper however other forms of print media are applicable.

The printer thus constructed is intended for use as a printer which is capable of printing information onto paper at a rate of at least 30 pages per minute ppm preferably at least 60 ppm with a printing resolution providing for so called photographic quality printing of at least 1200 dots per inch dpi preferably at least 1600 dpi. The manner in which the printer operates in order to provide these capabilities whilst being wall mounted will now be discussed.

Referring again to a cover portion is provided which snaps into the source tray assembly so as to form the outer surface thereof. The cover portion comprises cut out portions and for accommodating the user interface and the data connector respectively. The source tray assembly is hingedly mounted to the body via a hinge arrangement about a pivot not shown . The stack of paper is received and held on a surface tray of the tray portion which faces the body when the source tray assembly is mounted thereto. That is the stack is loaded on the source tray assembly by being placed on the tray and is held in a desired location on the tray by using a stop plate and a fence plate thereof.

In order to do this a plurality of holes are provided in the tray in a matrix which provides different positions for the stop and fence plates and . The stop plate has tabs arranged to engage with some of the plurality of holes of the tray and the fence plate similarly has a tab for engaging with some of the holes of the tray . Further the fence plate may have a clipping element which engages with a rod not shown provided on the tray so that it is laterally slidable across the tray .

The tray portion and consequently the source tray assembly is made to a size sufficient to accommodate the maximum sized paper to be used with the printer . In the embodiment shown in the figures the maximum paper size that may be accommodated in this way is A4 paper. However the printer may be arranged to accommodate a different maximum print media size. Different sized paper is accommodated in the source tray assembly as shown in by moving the stop and fence plates and into varying positions via the holes . Those skilled in the art will understand that the above described arrangement to accommodate variously sized paper stacks within the source tray assembly is merely an example and alternative arrangements and mechanisms may be used in accordance with the present invention to securely hold such paper stacks.

The source tray assembly also houses a picker assembly which is used to pick up and separate the individual sheets of paper from the stack so as to be advanced to the print engine . The picker assembly may comprise at least one D type drive rollers shown most clearly in the cross sectional view of the printer in which is driven by a motor . A plurality of drive rollers may be provided as shown in so as to extend across the sheets of the stack however a single drive roller having a length which achieves this is also within the scope of the present invention.

In the arrangement shown in the drive rollers are rotated clockwise by the motor so as to pick up a bottommost sheet from the stack which is exposed to the picker assembly through one or more gaps provided in the tray which correspond with the position of the drive roller s see also . The operation and speed of the drive rollers is controlled via control circuitry not shown of the printer . The drive rollers have a surface such as rubber which grips the sheets of paper in the stack . It will be understood that other types of picker mechanism could be used in accordance with the present invention.

As can be seen in the tray is angled from the horizontal by about 80 to 85 i.e. 5 to 10 from the vertical in order to position the bottommost sheet of the stack so that it may be readily picked up for advancement to the print engine assembly for printing by the drive rollers of the picker assembly . During the printing process the size of the stack will change as the sheets of paper are consumed. Thus the stack is spring loaded towards the picker assembly by a spring mechanism provided in the inner section of the body which acts against the stack so as to urge its bottom edge into the position shown in .

In this pick up process when the stack approaches its depleted state there will be a situation where only a small number of sheets remain e.g. two sheets. In this situation it is possible that all of these sheets will be picked up together creating a multiple feed i.e. more than a single sheet fed through the picker assembly to the print engine assembly for printing at any one time which is not desired since jams and or distorted prints can occur. This situation may occur since the friction between the sheets may be greater than the friction between the bottommost sheet of the stack and the drive rollers . Thus a pad is provided on the spring mechanism so as to present a higher friction surface between the last sheet of paper in the stack and the spring mechanism than that between the last and second to last sheets of paper in the stack . The pad may be formed of a material such as rubber felt cork etc.

As can be seen from the inner section of the body comprises foils which act as retaining members for the sheets within the stack . The foils extend across at least part of the width of the inner section of the body so as to project out from the surface of the inner section of the body . The foils are made from a flexible material such as plastic but are secured so as to be resilient to small forces. The purpose of the foils is as follows.

Since the tray is angled sagging in the paper of the stack may occur which can cause errors in the pick up process or individual sheets to separate from the stack which can cause jams. Therefore the foils are provided to apply a retaining force against the sheets in the stack which urges them back against the stack so as to substantially prevent such sagging. The resilient nature of the foils provides the appropriate retaining force to maintain the sheets in position. Whilst two foils are shown a greater or lesser number of foils is within the scope of the present invention as to are foils having recessed portions along their length rather than being continuous so long as the arrangement thereof provides the securing of the sheets in the stack .

Having been successfully picked up by the picker assembly the bottommost sheet advances to the print engine assembly for printing. The print engine assembly may be of the type described in the present Applicant s United States patent applications Ser. Nos. 10 760 254 to 10 760 258 the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference. These applications have been identified by their filing docket number which will be substituted with the corresponding application number once assigned. As such the print engine assembly is generally comprised of two parts a cradle unit and a cartridge unit shown variously in .

The cartridge unit comprises a printhead for printing on a sheet of paper as it passes thereby and at least one ink handling and storage reservoir for providing ink to the printhead . The printhead is a pagewidth printhead which means that no scanning of the printhead across the sheets is required. This enables high speed printing to be performed. Those skilled in the art however will understand that the present invention is applicable to printers employing other types of printheads. Further as shown in the cartridge unit comprises a single printhead . However a duplex printer may be used employing a cartridge unit having two pagewidth printheads aligned so that printing surfaces thereof oppose each other with a gap therebetween for accommodating the sheet of paper.

The cradle unit comprises a guide plate for guiding the sheet into the print engine a roller assembly and an associated motor for advancing and controlling the trajectory and speed of the sheet as it passes the printhead drive electronics for controlling the printing performed by the printhead and a capping unit for capping the printhead when printing is not being performed.

The cradle unit is removably mounted within the body and the cartridge unit is removable received within the cradle unit which allows for easy replacement of the printhead and the ink storage reservoirs and associated components when necessary. A release latch is provided for controlling this removal which can be easily manipulated by a user. In this way the complexity of the printer is minimised which provides ease of use.

By providing a plurality of the ink handling and storage reservoirs in the cartridge unit different coloured ink and associated printing fluids such as fixative for assisting the setting of the printed ink can be stored. The printhead draws the ink from these reservoirs in order to print on the sheets. A refill port is incorporated in the cartridge unit to which a refill cartridge not shown can be applied so as to refill the reservoirs with the particular types of inks which may have been depleted through printing. In order to facilitate this refilling process an indicator light such as an LED is provided on the cradle unit which is controlled to indicate to a user when refilling is needed and or has been completed in the manner described in the present Applicant s above mentioned applications. The need for refilling can also be indicated to a user via the user interface or by print manager software loaded on the user s personal computer PC connected to the printer as discussed later.

The mounted position of the cradle unit is such that the leading edge of the sheet being fed from the drive rollers of the picker assembly and guided by the guide plate enters the roller assembly of the cradle unit so as to be advanced past the printhead to be printed under action of the roller assembly and in part of the drive rollers . The leading edge of the sheet progresses through the cradle unit and following printing exits the body via an exit slot see and .

During the printing process the trailing edge of the sheet is transferred from being driven by the drive rollers to being driven only by the roller assembly of the print engine assembly due to the D type drive rollers used in the picker assembly . Once printed the trailing edge exits the body via the exit slot whereupon the printed sheet is collected by the extended collector .

The extended collector is shown variously in . As can be seen the collector is an articulated collection tray comprising two sections an upper section and a lower section attached to one another in a hinged relationship with hinges . The hinges may be arranged so that the lower section can be disengaged from the upper section when a moderate force is applied thereto. The total length provided by the upper and lower sections and is such that the maximum sized paper can be collected whilst providing sufficient clearance between the collected paper and the bottom of the body for a user to easily collect the printed sheets.

The lower section is substantially L shaped with a foot portion of the L shape acting as a stop surface for the collected sheets and having the retaining portion of the collector attached thereto. The retaining portion is used to assist in the retention of the collected sheets and the foot portion is provided so that the consecutively released sheets can be squared or knocked up so as to provide a neat collection of the printed sheets . The depth of the foot portion is sufficient to hold a plurality of sheets for example the number of sheets provided within the stack held by the source tray assembly .

When the collection tray is extended the lower section is angled relative to the upper section which is substantially parallel to the body along its length. By arranging the collection tray in this way the sheets ejected from the print engine assembly via the exit slot of the body are securely collected and retained on the upper and lower sections and in the manner shown in . That is as each of the sheets exits the body the leading edge thereof comes into contact with the surface of the lower section or the previously collected sheet held thereon and advances until it is stopped by the foot portion of the lower section . This is because the upper section of the collection tray is situated behind the exit slot with respect to the printer mounting direction see such that the lower section is sprung forward so as to lie in the exit path of the sheets . In this way the sheets are collected and held at an angle from the vertical i.e. substantially the angle of the lower section which together with the retaining member prevents the sheets from toppling forward from the collection tray .

The required angle e.g. about 5 from the vertical is provided by a spring located on the lower edge of the upper section which engages with the rear surface of the lower section so as to urge the lower section away from the plane of the upper section about the hinges . In the retracted position of the collection tray the lower section is forced to be in the plane of the upper section through contact with the rear surface of the body as shown in . In this way the retracted tray is situated within the body in a compact manner. Those skilled in the art will understand that other mechanisms for securely collecting the printed sheets of paper are within the scope of the present invention such as guiding ribs used on the surface of the collection tray for imparting lateral curvature to the sheets and the like.

In order to manoeuvre the collection tray into and out of its retracted and extended positions the winding arrangement is provided comprising a wire connected between the upper section and a winch situated within the upper surface of the body as shown in and the motor which operates the winch so as to change the length of the wire by winding the wire about the winch .

The upper section has tabs provided at the top of each of the longitudinal sides thereof which engage with running slots provided within the body . Therefore in operation as the length of the wire is changed by the winding arrangement the upper section and consequently the lower section is caused to lower or climb by the tabs sliding along the running slots . This winding may be controlled via the control circuitry or the drive electronics of the print engine assembly receiving instructions for extension retractions via the user interface or via print manager software loaded on the user s PC connected to the printer . Alternatively the operation may be performed automatically in conjunction with printing being performed by the printer and or as a result of pressure sensor s not shown provided in the foot portion of the collection tray sensing that the collected printouts have been removed from the collection tray .

In addition to acting as a means for collecting printouts the collector may be provided with a light pipe on the upper section and also the lower section if desired as a means of providing a user of the printer with an indication of the state of the printer and or the printing being performed thereby. Such a light pipe may consist of a hollow transparent material such as plastic provided as a channel for transmitting light along the length thereof from a light source or further light pipe located in the body see . This is achieved by the inner surface of the hollow material incorporating a lining which is highly reflective for light striking its surface at certain angles and transmissive for light striking at other angles. The channel may be moulded into the shape of ribs or the like provided on the surface of the upper and lower sections and of the collection tray as shown in .

The light source may comprise three differently coloured light sources such as red green and blue light sources which may each be a LED. The use of these different coloured light sources allows a wide spectrum of colours to be emitted by the light pipe when the light sources are selectively operated either individually or in combination. Alternatively the light source may be capable of multiple colour emission such as a tri colour LED. As such different coloured light can be used to indicate different states of the printer and or the printing being performed thereby by controlling the light source emission with the control circuitry of the printer and or the drive electronics of the print engine assembly .

For example a blue light emitted by the light pipes used as ribs of the collector may indicate that the printer is in a standby state whilst a green light may indicate that the printer is in the state of printing and a red light may indicate that the printer is malfunctioning such as there being a paper jam or there being a need for more paper or ink. Other combinations of lighting strobing flashing etc could alternatively be used for such purposes. For example increased aesthetic appeal of the printer could be provided by indicating the standby state with a cycle through a spectrum of colours. The operational state of the printer such as the occurrence of a paper jam may be determined by the printer in a conventional manner as understood by those skilled in the art.

In this arrangement if a problem arises with the functioning of the printer the light pipes can be used to indicate that a problem has occurred upon which the user can refer to the user interface or the print manager software loaded on the user s PC to determine what problem has occurred and where. Other parts of the printer could also be arranged with the light pipes for this purpose such as the light source itself or by providing the facia of the printer as stylised facia as shown in rather than one for holding prints etc as shown in where this stylised facia comprises the light pipes arranged as shown and also the user interface . In this way the wall mountable printer of has the appearance of a printer more so than the wall mountable printer of but still provides a greater aesthetic appeal than conventional printers. In this arrangement the cover portion of the source tray assembly may be omitted or rather replaced by the facia with the facia snapping into the source tray assembly .

The user interface in any form of the printer of the present invention may be a display screen such as a liquid crystal display as shown in used to display information about the state of the printer and the like and is preferably a touch screen via which users can operate the printer . This means that mechanical buttons and the like do not need to be provided on the printer which facilitates a compact design of the printer . However such buttons can be provided together with a simple display screen if desired.

The user interface can therefore be used either alone or in combination with the light pipes to display information as to the state of the printer such as the ink capacity left in the ink storage reservoirs of the print engine assembly the occurrence of a paper jam in the transport system as well as command and information menus etc for the operation of the printer . To achieve this the user interface may further comprise a memory and a processor not shown for storing software for such menus and processing commands input by the user by touching areas of the touch screen. Alternatively such components may be provided by the drive electronics of the print engine assembly with suitable connections between the user interface and the drive electronics being provided in the body .

The command and information menus displayed by the user interface can also be used to display information on print jobs being or to be performed by the printer . In order to receive print jobs the printer may be connected directly to a user terminal not shown such as a PC or connected to a plurality of such terminals via a network which terminal s transmit the print jobs to the drive electronics of the print engine assembly for processing and printing by the printhead . Such menus can also be easily adapted to display in different languages etc which is convenient for providing the printer for use in different countries. In this way the user interface is able to display information to a user regarding the operation of the printer which is more useful than that which is typically provided at the print manager level on a PC connected to the printer which is typically the case for conventional printers.

This connection external data devices terminals and networks can be provided in a wired manner via the data connector situated in the snap in cover portion of the source tray assembly as shown in and or via a USB connector and an Ethernet connector provided in the bottom surface of the body as shown in with suitable wiring between such connectors and the user interface and the drive electronics housed within the body . Alternatively the data connection can be provided in a wireless manner by using a WIFI card and or a Bluetooth card located in the inner section of the body behind the foils as shown in . Alternatively still or in addition the printer may incorporate means for directly receiving image data for the print jobs by incorporating photocard slots or the like not shown for receiving photocards and the like so that images stored thereon can be downloaded to the printer s or the drive electronics memory for direct printing.

Power for the user interface the print engine assembly particularly for the motor of the roller assembly the printhead the drive electronics and the capping unit the picker assembly particularly for the motor of the drive rollers the winding arrangement particularly the winding motor the light pipes and source and and other electronic components of the printer is supplied by the PSU which is powered by an external power source not shown connected thereto via a power connector provided in the bottom surface of the body as shown in . Alternatively battery power not shown may be provided to the PSU which coupled with the above described wireless data communication eliminates the need for any cabling to the printer . Corresponding connections from the PSU to the various electronic components can be provided via suitable wiring housed within the body .

For the wired versions of the printer the provision of the data and power connections on the bottom surface of the body of the printer behind the exit slot with respect to the mounting direction of the printer see means that any cables from external devices such as a user s PC can be easily connected to the printer without interfering with the collector . On the other hand such connections could be provided on the rear surface of the body coupled with means to provide such cables through the wall space to which the printer is mounted.

With respect to the mounting of the printer to a wall or the like as described earlier the mounting bosses may be provided on the rear surface of the body as shown in . In this way a fixing means e.g. a screw can be engaged with the mounting bosses through the wall surface so as to suspend the printer from the wall etc. Any manner of mounting is applicable so long as it is sufficient to support the combined weight of the printer and the stack of paper provided therein. It should be noted that the components of the printer including the body the source tray assembly the facia and the various components thereof can in the most part be moulded from lightweight material such as plastic so as to provide maximum flexibility in the type of mounting arrangement used.

Once mounted the printer in its non operational state i.e. with the collector retracted into the body may appear as shown in with a photo or picture provided in the facia . As described earlier in order to place the photo into the facia the facia is hinged open from the source tray assembly which is mounted to the body of the printer and the photo is slid into the envelope portion through a slot see so as to be displayed through the transparent window provided on the outer surface of the facia . A cut out portion is also provided in the envelope portion for easy removal of the photo .

Also as can be seen most clearly from the facia is further provided with a picture frame portion on the front surface thereof about the transparent window . In this way when the printer is in the non operational state the appearance of the printer is that of a framed picture hanging on the wall or the like. This is because the picture frame portion has a size which is substantially the same as the size of the facia and front surface of the body of the printer . Such an arrangement provides a means of enabling the printer to blend into the deco e of a room or office. That is the presence of the printer can be disguised until it is required to operate. Upon operation the collector is extended from the body of the printer as described earlier and the printouts collected thereon for removal by a user as shown in . Once the printouts have been collected the collector is then retracted back into the body of the printer to again provide the state shown in .

The printer may also be adapted for mounting to other substantially vertical surfaces. For example it may be desired to mount the printer in an office environment such as on a partition wall or privacy screen of a work station and the like. In such an arrangement the rear surface of the body may be fitted with a cover as shown in . As can be seen the cover may comprise a plurality of slots in the surface thereof which are arranged to engage a mounting bracket or hook for mounting the printer on the partition wall. That is an engaging portion of the bracket is arranged to engage with any one of the slots at a time and a hook portion of the bracket which projects from the rear surface of the body when the engaging portion is engaged with one of the slots is arranged to engage over a top surface of the partition wall. In this way the plurality of slots provide a number of reconfigurable positions of the bracket which in turn provides a number of different mounting heights for the printer . This variety of possible printer heights provides flexibility in the mounting of the printer so as to sufficiently accommodate the space required for the extended collector .

The printer mounted to a partition wall of a work station via this mounting arrangement is shown in with the suspended height of the printer suitable for the extended collector . As can be seen in this arrangement the printer is provided in a non intrusive manner in the work station such that sufficient space is left on the desktop for a user s PC and the like and neat connection of the PC to the printer is provided via cables as described earlier.

The bracket may be specifically configured to fit over a specific sized partition wall or provided as a one size fits all configuration. In any event the arrangement of the bracket in the slots and the attachment of the cover to the body must be such to sufficiently support the combined weight of the printer and the stack of paper provided therein. As such the cover may be snapped onto the body via a sufficiently strong clipping arrangement or attached to the body by any other suitable means or provided as part of the body itself.

In consideration of the various locales in which the printer is able to be mounted to a wall and the like various facia styles may be desired for the printer . That is the printer may be adapted so that a single printer unit is able to accommodate different facias . For example the picture frame portion may be provided as a snap on portion of the facia such that picture frames of different styles can be easily provided and alternated such as the different style picture frame portions shown in . Alternatively the facia itself may be removed by providing the hinges of the facia with the ability to disengage from the source tray assembly such that the picture frame facia as shown in can be removed so as to be replaced with a facia having a different picture frame or the stylised facia of or any other suitable facia which will provide aesthetic appeal and or functionality of the printer in accordance with the locale in which the printer is mounted.

Exemplary construction and operation of the wall mountable printer of the present invention is now described.

For the printer configured to print on A4 paper as being the maximum sized paper the pagewidth printhead of the print engine assembly has a printhead width of 224 mm or 8.8 inches. In order to form this printing width the printhead comprises a plurality of printhead integrated circuits ICs incorporating printing or ink ejecting nozzles therein such as those described in the present Applicant s above referenced applications RRA01US to RRA33US.

In accordance with the present invention at least 5 000 nozzles may be incorporated to provide the required quality of printing i.e. at least 1600 dpi at the high speed of at least 30 ppm preferably at least 60 ppm. However depending upon the printing quality and speed required the printhead may comprise at least 10 000 nozzles preferably at least 20 000 nozzles and more preferably at least 50 000 nozzles in higher speed higher quality printing applications.

These nozzles are arranged as a two dimensional array across the width of the printhead so as to eject ink and other printing fluids such as fixative onto the surface of the passing print media in order to print images thereon. Each of the nozzles corresponds to a printed dot on the print media and therefore the larger the number of nozzles and the greater the packing density thereof in the printhead the closer the printed dots and therefore the higher the resolution of the printing. The drive electronics receives and processes image data from an external data source via one or more of the data connectors and or data devices and and drives the nozzles of the printhead in accordance with the processed image data explained in more detail later .

With respect to the type of nozzle systems which are applicable for the printhead any type of ink jet nozzle array which can be integrated on a printhead IC is suitable. That is systems such as a continuous ink system an electrostatic system and a drop on demand system including thermal and piezoelectric types can be used.

Regarding a thermal drop on demand system there are various types known which typically include ink reservoirs adjacent the nozzles and heater elements in thermal contact therewith. The heater elements heat the ink which creates gas bubbles therein. The gas bubbles generate pressures in the ink causing droplets to be ejected through the nozzles onto the print media. The amount of ink ejected onto the print media by each nozzle and when this occurs is controlled by the drive electronics. Such thermal systems impose limitations on the type of ink that can be used however since the ink must be resistant to heat and also require a cooling process which can reduce the optimum printing speed.

Regarding a piezoelectric drop on demand system various types are also known which typically use piezo crystals arranged adjacent the ink reservoirs which are caused to flex when an electric current flows therethrough. This flexing causes droplets of ink to be ejected from the nozzles in a similar manner to the thermal systems described above. Such piezoelectric systems allow more control over the shape and size of the ink droplets than the thermal systems and the ink does not have to be heated and cooled between cycles giving a greater range of available ink types.

Further a micro electromechanical system MEMS of nozzles could be used which includes thermo actuators which cause the nozzles to eject ink droplets. Such nozzle systems are described in the present Applicant s following co pending and granted applications

Description of an exemplary MEMS nozzle system applicable to the printhead is provided below as is an exemplary manner in which the drive electronics processes the image data and drives such a nozzle system with reference the .

The printhead can however be adapted to print using any desired number of colours and can comprise a monolithic printhead IC or require multiple substrates depending upon implementation. Further the rows of the nozzle arrangements are staggered with respect to each other allowing closer spacing of ink dots during printing than would be possible with a single row of nozzles. The multiple rows also allow for redundancy if desired thereby allowing for a predetermined failure rate per nozzle.

The printhead ICs of the printhead are manufactured using an integrated circuit fabrication technique and as previously indicated embody a micro electromechanical system MEMS . Referring to which shows a single nozzle each printhead IC includes a silicon wafer substrate and CMOS microprocessing circuitry formed thereon. This is done by depositing a silicon dioxide layer on the substrate as a dielectric layer and aluminium electrode contact layers on the silicon dioxide layer . Both the substrate and the layer are etched to define an ink channel and an aluminium diffusion barrier is positioned about the ink channel .

A passivation layer of silicon nitride is deposited over the aluminium contact layers and the layer . Portions of the passivation layer that are positioned over the contact layers have openings therein to provide access to the contact layers .

Each nozzle includes a nozzle chamber which is defined by a nozzle wall a nozzle roof and a radially inner nozzle rim . The ink channel is in fluid communication with the chamber .

A moveable rim that includes a movable seal lip is located at the lower end of the nozzle wall . An encircling wall surrounds the nozzle and provides a stationery seal lip that when the nozzle is at rest as shown in is adjacent the moveable rim . A fluidic seal is formed due to the surface tension of ink trapped between the stationery seal lip and the moveable seal lip . This prevents leakage of ink from the chamber whilst providing a low resistance coupling between the encircling wall and the nozzle wall .

The nozzle wall forms part of lever arrangement that is mounted to a carrier having a generally U shaped profile with a base attached to the layer . The lever arrangement also includes a lever arm that extends from the nozzle wall and incorporates a lateral stiffening beam . The lever arm is attached to a pair of passive beams that are formed from titanium nitride and are positioned at each side of the nozzle best seen in . The other ends of the passive beams are attached to the carriers .

The lever arm is also attached to an actuator beam which is formed from TiN. This attachment to the actuator beam is made at a point which is a small but critical distance higher than the attachments to the passive beam .

As can best be seen from the actuator beam is substantially U shaped in plan defining a current path between an electrode and an opposite electrode . Each of the electrodes and is electrically connected to a respective point in the contact layer . The actuator beam is also mechanically secured to an anchor and the anchor is configured to constrain motion of the actuator beam to the left of when the nozzle arrangement is activated.

The actuator beam is conductive being composed of TiN but has a sufficiently high enough electrical resistance to generate self heating when a current is passed between the electrodes and . No current flows through the passive beams so they do not experience thermal expansion.

In operation the nozzle is filled with ink that defines a meniscus under the influence of surface tension. The ink is retained in the chamber by the meniscus and will not generally leak out in the absence of some other physical influence.

To fire ink from the nozzle a current is passed between the contacts and passing through the actuator beam . The self heating of the beam causes it to expand with the actuator beam being dimensioned and shaped so that it expands predominantly in a horizontal direction with respect to . The expansion is constrained to the left by the anchor so the end of the actuator beam adjacent the lever arm is impelled to the right.

The relative horizontal inflexibility of the passive beams prevents them from allowing much horizontal movement of the lever arm . However the relative displacement of the attachment points of the passive beams and the actuator beam respectively to the lever arm causes a twisting movement that in turn causes the lever arm to move generally downwardly with a pivoting or hinging motion. However the absence of a true pivot point means that rotation is about a pivot region defined by bending of the passive beams .

The downward movement and slight rotation of the lever arm is amplified by the distance of the nozzle wall from the passive beams . The downward movement of the nozzle walls and roof causes a pressure increase within the chamber causing the meniscus to bulge as shown in . The surface tension of the ink causes the fluid seal to be stretched by this motion however ink is not allowed to leak out.

As shown in at the appropriate time the drive current is stopped and the actuator beam quickly cools and contracts. This contraction causes the lever arm to commence its return to the quiescent position which in turn causes a reduction in pressure in the chamber . The interplay of the momentum of the bulging ink and its inherent surface tension and the negative pressure caused by the upward movement of the nozzle chamber causes thinning and ultimately snapping of the bulging meniscus to define an ink drop that continues upwards until it contacts passing print media.

Immediately after the drop detaches the meniscus forms the concave shape shown in . Surface tension causes the pressure in the chamber to remain relatively low until ink has been suctioned upwards through the inlet or ink channel which returns the nozzle arrangement and the ink to the quiescent state shown in .

In order to control the delivery of the drops from each of the nozzles the print engine assembly uses the drive electronics . As described earlier the drive electronics receives image data of print jobs to be printed by the printer . Referring to this image data may be received from an external data source such as a computer system or the user s PC . The PC is programmed to perform various steps involved in printing image data i.e. a document including receiving the document step buffering and rasterising the document to provide a page description steps and and compressing this to provide a page image step suitable for transmission to the print engine assembly of the printer .

At the drive electronics of the print engine assembly provided in the printer the compressed multi layered page image is buffered step and then expanded to separate the different layers of the page image step . The expanded contone layer is dithered step and then the black layer is composited over the dithered contone layer step . Coded data can also be rendered step to form an additional layer to be printed using infrared ink for example that is substantially invisible to the human eye. The black dithered contone and infrared layers are combined step to form a page that is supplied to the printhead for printing step which as mentioned above is preferably configured to print in five colours.

Further the document data is preferably divided into a high resolution bi level mask layer for text and line art and a medium resolution contone colour image layer for images or background colours. Optionally coloured text can be supported by the addition of a medium to high resolution contone texture layer for texturing text and line art with colour data taken from an image or from flat colours. The contone layers are generalised by representing them in abstract image and texture layers which can refer to either image data or flat colour data. This division of data into layers based on content follows the base mode Mixed Raster Content MRC model known to those skilled in the art. Like the MRC base mode compromises are made in some cases when data to be printed overlap. For example all overlaps may be reduced to a 3 layer representation in a process collision resolution embodying the compromises explicitly.

The central data structure is a generalised representation of the three layers called a page element shown in a simplified UML diagram in . The page element can be used to represent units ranging from single rendered elements emerging from a rendering engine up to an entire band of a print job. Conceptually the bi level symbol region selects between the two colour sources as described in more detail below with reference to . It will be appreciated that the device components shown in which carry out the steps to shown in will typically be device dependent in that they process the data into a form required by a software or hardware component further downstream.

In a renderer is provided outside of the more general printer system pipeline shown in in order to render files to be printed and deliver the rendered elements to a data receiver step of the pipeline using an Application Programming Interface API exposed by the data receiver for that purpose. The rendered elements are delivered in order according to the painter s algorithm which is well known to those skilled in the art. The data passed in through the API is converted by the data receiver into lists of dictionaries and page elements for processing in later stages.

The data is then rasterised step in as follows. A collision resolver accepts the simple page elements created by the data receiver via buffering at step and creates a fully opaque resolved page element for each intersection of a new element with the background and any elements already present. Fundamentally the collision resolver guarantees that the entire page is tiled with opaque elements. A stripper divides a band of data into horizontally overlapping pieces which is performed since the printer is relatively fast and as such uses multiple parallel devices in order to achieve the required output dot rate. In such cases each horizontally overlapping piece is fed into a corresponding device downstream. Where such data division is not required the stripper can be omitted.

Different printing configurations will require different configurations of layers for delivery to the downstream hardware. A layer reorganiser converts 3 layer page elements to the appropriate 2 or 3 layer form for the specific configuration. Again there may be cases in which this function is not required in which case the layer organiser can be omitted. A contone combiner combines and clips the image and texture layers of all page elements in a strip into single image and texture layers as required by downstream hardware.

A colour converter transforms the contone planes of all page elements from the input colour space to a device specific colour space which is usually CMYK . A mask combiner performs the same operation on the mask layer as the contone combiner performs on the contone layers. All elements are clipped to a strip boundary and drawn into a single mask buffer.

A densitometer measures the density of the current page as a percentage of total possible density. This operation is necessary when the power supply of the printer is not able to handle a fully dense page at full speed. A contone compressor compresses the contone layers of all page elements in order to reduce downstream memory and or transmission bandwidth requirements. A mask formatter converts the mask layer of page elements which may be represented as regions of placed symbol references into the form expected by a downstream mask decompressor.

A size limiter ensures that all size limitations for bands and for entire pages are adhered to by either dividing bands into smaller bands or by recompressing the data repeating until the constraint is satisfied. If data is to be transmitted to the printer between pipeline stages a serialised form of the data structures is generated in a serialiser transmitted then deserialised in a deserialiser .

Within the drive electronics of the print engine assembly incorporated in the printer a distributor converts data from a proprietary representation into a hardware specific representation and ensures that the data for each strip is sent to the correct hardware device whilst observing any constraints or requirements on data transmission to these devices. The distributor distributes the converted data to an appropriate one of a plurality of pipelines . The pipelines are identical to each other and in essence provide decompression scaling and dot compositing functions to generate a set of printable dot outputs for the nozzles of the printhead .

Each pipeline includes a buffer for receiving the page image data from the PC step in . A contone decompressor decompresses the colour contone planes and a mask decompressor decompresses the monotone text layer step in . Further a contone scaler and a mask scaler are provided to scale the decompressed contone and mask planes respectively to take into account the size of the print media onto which the processed page is to be printed by the printhead .

The scaled contone planes are then dithered by a ditherer using stochastic dispersed dot dither step in . Clustered dot or amplitude modulated dither is not used since dispersed dot or frequency modulated dither reproduces high spatial frequencies i.e. image detail almost to the limits of the dot resolution while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full colour depth when spatially integrated by the eye. A stochastic dither matrix is carefully designed to be relatively free of objectionable low frequency patterns when tiled across the image. As such its size typically exceeds the minimum size required to support a particular number of intensity levels e.g. 16 16 8 bits for 257 intensity levels .

The dithered planes are then composited in a dot compositor on a dot by dot basis to provide dot data suitable for printing steps and in . This data is forwarded to data distribution and drive circuitry which in turn distributes the data to the correct nozzle actuators of the printhead which in turn cause ink to be ejected from the correct nozzles at the correct time step in .

In the above system a mainly software based PC portion is provided prior to the serialiser and a mainly hardware based print engine assembly portion that is located within the printer remote from the PC is provided including everything from the deserialiser onwards. It will be appreciated however that the indicated division between computer system and printer is somewhat arbitrary and various components can be placed on different sides of the divide without substantially altering the operation as a whole. It will also be appreciated that some of the device components can be handled in hardware or software remotely from the computer system and printer. For example rather than relying on the general purpose processor of the PC some of the components in the architecture can be accelerated using dedicated hardware.

Preferably the hardware pipelines are embodied in a controller of the print engine assembly which also preferably includes one or more system on a chip SoC components as well as the print engine assembly pipeline control application specific logic configured to perform some or all of the functions described above in relation to the printing pipeline.

Referring to from the highest point of view the controller of the print engine assembly consists of three distinct subsystems a central processing unit CPU subsystem a dynamic random access memory DRAM subsystem and a print engine assembly pipeline PEP subsystem . Various components of these subsystems to are described below with a more detailed description of these components including their various functions being provided later in Tables 1 to 3.

The CPU subsystem includes a CPU that controls and configures all aspects of the other subsystems and provides general support for interfacing and synchronizing the various components of the printer with the print engine assembly . It also controls the low speed communication to Quality Assurance QA devices described in more detail later . The CPU subsystem also contains various peripherals to aid the CPU such as General Purpose Input Output GPIO which includes motor control etc Interrupt Controller Unit ICU Low Speed Serial LSS master and general Timers TIM .

The DRAM subsystem accepts requests from the CPU Serial Communications Block SCB on the CPU subsystem which provides a full speed USB1.1 interface to the host as well as an Interface INT to other controllers of the print engine assembly and blocks within the PEP subsystem . The DRAM subsystem and in particular DRAM Interface Unit DIU thereof arbitrates the various requests and determines which request should win access to DRAM incorporated therein. DIU arbitrates based on configured parameters to allow sufficient access to DRAM for all requestors. DIU also hides the implementation specifics of DRAM such as page size number of banks and refresh rates.

The PEP subsystem accepts compressed pages from DRAM and renders them to bi level dots for a given print line destined for PrintHead Interface PHI that communicates directly with the printhead ICs of the printhead . The first stage of the page expansion pipeline includes Contone Decoder Unit CDU Lossless Bi level Decoder LBD and Tag Encoder TE . CDU expands the JPEG compressed contone typically CMYK layers LBD expands the compressed bi level layer typically K and TE encodes infrared tags for later rendering typically in IR or K ink . The output from the first stage is a set of buffers Contone FIFO Unit CFU Spot FIFO Unit SFU and Tag FIFO Unit TFU . CFU and SFU buffers are implemented in dynamic random access memory.

The second stage includes Halftone Compositor Unit HCU which dithers the contone layer and composites position tags and the bi level spot layer over the resulting bi level dithered layer. A number of compositing options can be implemented depending upon the printhead with which the controller is used. Up to six channels of bi level data are produced from this stage although not all channels may be present on the printhead . For example the printhead may be CMY only with K pushed into the CMY channels and IR ignored. Alternatively the encoded tags may be printed in K if IR ink is not available or for testing purposes .

In the third stage Dead Nozzle Compensator DNC compensates for dead nozzles in the printhead by colour redundancy and error diffusing of dead nozzle data into surrounding dots. The resultant bi level six channel dot data typically CMYK IR and fixative is buffered and written to a set of line buffers stored in DRAM via Dotline Writer Unit DWU . Finally the dot data is loaded back from DRAM and passed to PHI via a dot FIFO not shown . The dot FIFO accepts data from Line Loader Unit LLU at the system clock rate while PHI removes data from the dot FIFO and sends it to the printhead at a rate of times the system clock rate.

The details and functions of the above described components of the subsystems to and those shown in but not described above are provided in Tables 1 to 3 below for the CPU subsystem the DRAM subsystem and the PEP subsystem respectively.

Preferably DRAM of the DRAM subsystem is 2.5 Mbytes in size of which about 2 Mbytes are available for compressed page store data. A compressed page is received in two or more bands with a number of bands stored in memory. As a band of the page is consumed by the PEP subsystem for printing a new band can be downloaded. The new band may be for the current page or the next page. Using banding it is possible to begin printing a page before the complete compressed page is downloaded but care must be taken to ensure that data is always available for printing or a buffer under run may occur.

The embedded USB 1.1 device accepts compressed page data and control commands from the PC and facilitates the data transfer to either DRAM or to another controller in a multiple controller print engine assembly. A multiple controller print engine assembly may be used to perform different functions depending upon the particular implementation. For example in some cases a controller can be used simply for its onboard DRAM while another controller attends to the various decompression and formatting functions described above. This can reduce the chance of buffer under run which can happen in the event that the printhead commences printing a page prior to all the data for that page being received and the rest of the data is not received in time. Adding an extra controller for its memory buffering capabilities doubles the amount of data that can be buffered even if none of the other capabilities of the additional controller are utilized.

Each controller may have several QA devices designed to cooperate with each other to ensure the quality of the mechanics of the printer the quality of the ink supply so the nozzles of the printhead will not be damaged during printing and the quality of the software to ensure the printhead and the mechanics of the printer are not damaged.

Normally each controller of the print engine assembly will have an associated QA device not shown which stores information on the attributes of the printer such as the maximum printing speed. The cartridge unit of the print engine assembly also contains an ink QA device not shown which stores information on the cartridge unit such as the amount of ink remaining in the ink storage and handling reservoirs . The printhead also has a QA device not shown which is configured to act as a ROM effectively as an EEPROM that stores printhead specific information such as dead nozzle mapping and the characteristics of the printhead . The CPU in the CPU subsystem of the controller also runs a logical software QA device not shown and may optionally load and run program code from a QA device that effectively acts as a serial EEPROM. Generally all of the QA devices are physically identical with only the contents of flash memory differentiating one from the other.

Each controller has two LSS system buses that can communicate with QA devices for system authentication and ink usage accounting. A large number of QA devices can be used per bus and their position in the system is unrestricted with the exception that printhead QA and ink QA devices should be on separate LSS busses.

In use the logical QA device communicates with the ink QA device to determine remaining ink. The reply from the ink QA device is authenticated with reference to the printhead QA device. The verification from the printhead QA device is itself authenticated by the logical QA device thereby indirectly adding an additional authentication level to the reply from the ink QA device.

Data passed between the QA devices other than the printhead QA device is authenticated by way of digital signatures. For example HMAC SHA1 authentication may be used for data and RSA may be used for program code although other schemes could be used instead.

A single controller can control a plurality of the printhead ICs of the printhead and up to the six printing fluid channels e.g. CMYK IR and F . However the controller is preferably colour space agnostic. Such that although the controller can accept contone data as CMYX or RGBX where X is an optional 4th channel it also can accept contone data in any print colour space. Additionally the controller provides a mechanism for arbitrary mapping of input channels to output channels including combining dots for ink optimization and generation of channels based on any number of other channels. However inputs are typically CMYK for contone input K for the bi level input the optional IR tag dots are typically rendered to an infrared layer and a fixative channel is generated due to the high speed printing capability.

Further the controller is also preferably resolution agnostic such that it merely provides a mapping between input resolutions and output resolutions by means of scale factors and has no knowledge of the physical resolution of the printhead . Further still the controller is preferably pagelength agnostic such that successive pages are typically split into bands and downloaded into the page store as each band of information is consumed.

Turning now to the printhead ICs of the printhead will be further described. For clarity only one printhead IC is shown in but it will be appreciated that a corresponding arrangement is implemented for the other printhead ICs.

The nozzle core array is shown in detail in . As can be seen in the nozzle core array comprises an array of nozzle columns a fire select shift register and up to six channels each of which is represented by a corresponding dot shift register .

As shown in the fire select shift register includes a forward path fire shift register a reverse path fire shift register and a select shift register and each dot shift register includes an odd dot shift register and an even dot shift register . The odd and even dot shift registers and are connected at one end such that data is clocked through the odd shift register in one direction then through the even shift register in the reverse direction. The output of all but the final even dot shift register is fed to one input of one of plurality of multiplexers . This input of the multiplexers is selected by a signal CoreScan during post production testing. In normal operation the CoreScan signal selects dot data input Dot x supplied to the other input of each of the multiplexers . This causes Dot x for each colour to be supplied to the respective dot shift registers .

A single column N of the array of nozzle columns is also shown in . In the embodiment shown the column N includes 12 data values comprising an odd data value and an even data value for each of the six dot shift registers . Column N also includes an odd fire value from the forward fire shift register and an even fire value from the reverse fire shift register which are supplied as inputs to a multiplexer . The output of the multiplexer is controlled by a select value in the select shift register . When the select value is zero the odd fire value is output and when the select value is one the even fire value is output.

Each of the odd and even data values and is provided as an input to corresponding odd and even dot latches and respectively. Each of the dot latches and and its associated data value and form a unit cell such as a unit cell shown in for the odd latch and the odd data value . This situation for the odd dot shift register is illustrated in more detail in which is also applicable to the situation for the even dot shift register .

Referring to the odd dot latch is a D type flip flop that accepts the output of the odd data value which is held by the unit cell a D type flip flop which forms an element of the odd dot shift register . The data input to the flip flop is provided from the output of a previous element in the odd dot shift register unless the element under consideration is the first element in the shift register in which case its input is the Dot x value . Data is clocked from the output of the flip flop into the odd dot latch upon receipt of a negative pulse provided on line LsyncL.

The output of the odd dot latch is provided as one of the inputs to a three input AND gate . Other inputs to the AND gate are a fire enable Fr signal from the output of multiplexer and a pulse profile Pr signal. The firing time of a nozzle is controlled by the pulse profile signal Pr and can be for example lengthened to take into account a low voltage condition that arises due to low battery in a situation where the power supply of the printer is provided as a battery element not shown mounted in the body for example. This is to ensure that a relatively consistent amount of ink is efficiently ejected from each nozzle as it is fired. The profile signal Pr may be the same for each of the dot shift registers which provides a balance between complexity cost and performance. However the Pr signal can be applied globally i.e. is the same for all nozzles or can be individually tailored to each unit cell or even to each nozzle.

Once the data is loaded into the odd dot latch the Fr and Pr signals are applied to the AND gate combining to trigger the nozzle to eject a dot of ink for each odd dot latch that contains a logic 1.

As shown in the Fr signals are routed on a diagonal to enable firing of one colour in the current column the next colour in the following column and so on. This averages the current demand by spreading it over six columns in time delayed fashion.

The dot latches and the latches forming the various shift registers are fully static and are CMOS based. The design and construction of latches is well known to those skilled in the art and so is not described in detail herein.

As stated earlier the printhead which has a printing surface or zone across the width of a maximum sized page of print media that can be printed on using the printer may incorporate at least 5 000 nozzles and even more than 50 000 nozzles in order to provide the required quality of printing at the high speed printing of the printer across this pagewidth. For example the combined printhead ICs may define a printhead having 13824 nozzles per channel including the coloured ink and fixative channels.

The nozzle speed may be as much as 20 kHz for the printer capable of printing at about 60 ppm and even more for higher speeds. At this range of nozzle speeds the amount of ink than can be ejected by the entire printhead is at least 50 million drop per second. However as the number of nozzles is increased to provide for higher speed and higher quality printing at least 100 million drops per second preferably at least 300 million drops per second and more preferably at least 1 billion drops per second may be delivered.

Consequently in order to accommodate printing at these speeds the drive electronics and particularly the controller s thereof must calculate whether a nozzle is to eject a drop of ink at a rate of at least 50 million dots per second and depending on the printing speed at least 100 million dots per second preferably at least 300 million dots per second and more preferably at least 1 billion dots per second for the higher speed higher quality printing applications.

For the colour printer printing with the maximum width of A4 paper the above described ranges of the number of nozzles and print speeds results in an area print speed of at least 50 cmper second and depending on the printing speed at least 100 cmper second preferably at least 200 cmper second and more preferably at least 500 cmper second at the higher speeds.

While the present invention has been illustrated and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof various modifications will be apparent to and might readily be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Accordingly it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein but rather that the claims be broadly construed.
