The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention is directed generally to a compact engine generator or alternator combination and specifically to a more compact engine generator for use with unmanned submersibles hereinafter called Unmanned Undersea Vehicles or UUVs .

An Undermanned Undersea Vehicle UUV which operates independent of air must use thermal engines with air independent fuels or use electric power with energy delivered via primary batteries secondary batteries fuel cells etc. The range of the UUVs can be significantly increased if an air breathing engine is used to recharge the batteries. This technique has not yet been accepted in UUVs since the diesel engine and generator occupy a large amount of space and weight thereby leaving little allocation for fuel storage and batteries. This technique is also not acceptable due in part to acoustic signature considerations. If a quiet compact air breathing generator could be constructed then this type of propulsion system would be of greater benefit.

Various engine types are commonly available such as a spark ignition combustion engine a compression ignition internal combustion engine and an external combustion engine. These engines can be powered by either a monopropellant or bipropellant fuel oxidizer energy source.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 343 704 to Kanzaki et al. discloses a double headed and swash plate type engine which includes double headed pistons defining front spaces and rear spaces and anchored to the swash plate by shoes. Hence the reciprocal movement of the double headed pistons due to the expansion and compression of an operating gas in the front and rear spaces is directly converted into the rotary movement of the swash plate.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 960 082 to Sullivan et al. discloses a bent axis rotary piston engine with the capability of dual output power improved cooling and gas flow through the engine as well as supercharging and improved scavenging of the exhaust.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 390 052 to McMaster et al. discloses a wobble plate engine having a wobble plate that rolls against truncated cone portions of a housing and has an inner extremity rotatably supported by an axially inclined annular bearing on a spherical member of the wobble plate assembly so as to rotate a shaft during the wobbling motion.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 334 513 to Belser discloses an axial piston machine having a swash plate and a control piston which contacts the swash plate by way of a side block which is partially received by the swash plate or the control piston.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 968 751 to Shulenberger et al. discloses a system and method for converting reciprocal linear motion of one or more pistons into rotary motion of an output power shaft whose rotational axis is parallel to the motions of the pistons or conversely rotary motion of a similarly configured input shaft into reciprocal linear motion of one or more pistons.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 174 139 to Stolzer discloses an axial piston machine which includes a cylinder block having cylinder bores in which pistons are movably guided with the pistons being supported on an inclined or wobble plate in order to perform a lifting movement.

U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008 0271715 to duPont discloses an internal combustion two stroke barrel engine including a power output shaft configured to rotate an even number of cylinders around the output shaft where each cylinder includes opposing first and second power pistons configured to reciprocate within their respective power cylinder and a pair of non rotating wobble plates opposed and hingedly connected to the power pistons.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 236 123 to Pinkerton discloses an electrical generator having at least one rotating ring of field magnets which produce a circular array of magnetic fields and a ring of generator output coils which are in the magnetic fields. Pinkerton s machine is shaft driven much like a conventional generator. Pinkerton does not disclose a piston engine with a rotating block. Specifically Pinkerton discloses that a motor rotates a shaft an optional flywheel and a generator magnet assembly. Also Pinkerton describes an ability to move the coils via an actuator to change voltage.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 400 069 to Kundel discloses a generator for producing electric power including a drive mechanism such as a drive motor having a rotor supported for rotation about an axis first and second generator magnets to produce a magnetic field whose flux extends between reference poles of the magnets plus a stator with an electrical conductor winding located adjacent to the magnets.

Accordingly it is a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide a lighter more compact engine and generator combination for use in UUVs.

To attain the object described the present invention provides an integrated engine and generator including a stationary non rotating shaft and an engine block rotating about the shaft with a plurality of cylinders. Each cylinder includes a piston translating in rectilinear motion while rotating about the shaft.

The engine and generator also includes a stationary generator housing and stator surrounding the engine block and having stator windings wound into the generator housing.

Permanent magnets are affixed to an outer curvilinear surface of the engine block to rotate with the engine block. The magnets are separated from the generator housing by a controlled dimension air gap. Provided stator windings are electrically configured to match pole pairs of the permanent magnets to generate induced electrical current upon engine block rotation.

Standard diesel electric powerplants have separately housed engine and generator devices operationally connected on a common shaft whereas the present invention combines the thermal engine portion and permanent magnet generator portion into a single integrated system. This system reduces size and weight and enables smaller and lighter engine generator systems for UUV applications.

The rotating block engine design used in the present invention enables integration of the generator with the engine. Also the multi lobe cam enables balance of axial forces resulting in reduced axial vibration.

These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description drawings and claims.

In the figures the rotating engine block is configured with a number of cylinders in which pistons translate in rectilinear motion while rotating with the engine block about a shaft . In the preferred embodiment five cylinders are shown although this number can vary as needed.

The pistons are attached by connecting rods to a cam follower wobble plate and a bearing assembly . The stationary shaft and a swash plate are fixed together and remove the rotating moment of the rotating block and piston assembly.

The engine block rotates at the same rotational speed as the cam follower or wobble plate . Fuel and oxidizer mixture is ported into a combustion chamber and hot combustion gas enters the cylinders through inlet tubes imparting an axial force on the pistons thereby resulting in rotary motion of the engine block .

Permanent magnets are fixedly attached to an outer cylindrical surface of the rotating engine block thereby rotating with the block. Stator windings are wound into a stationary generator housing in an appropriate electrical configuration to match the number of permanent magnet pole pairs and to generate induced electrical current upon engine block rotation. The magnets and stationary housing are separated by a controlled dimension air gap through which magnetic flux passes.

The rotating engine block is configured with a working gas inlet and exhaust valve ports not shown to control the sequence of working fluid flow to from the cylinders and cooling channels to remove heat from the engine and generator. The stationary housing could also be configured with cooling channels to enable heat removal from the stator .

The engine portion of the integrated engine generator system can be configured as a spark ignition internal combustion engine or a compression ignition internal combustion engine. Furthermore the engine can be powered by either a monopropellant or a bi propellant fuel oxidizer energy source.

The generator portion of the integrated engine generator system can be configured with either surface mounted or embedded permanent magnets and can make use of either straight or skewed magnets and or stator slots.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. Also the engine and generator claimed and described herein is available for any application and is not limited to use with an unmanned undersea vehicle.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
