title: Tube shaft with integrated oil separator
abstract: An oil-laden gas stream flows axially through a tube shaft formed with at least one radially throughgoing inner oil-discharge port and, axially downstream therefrom, with at lest one radially throughgoing inner gas-discharge port. A bearing supports the tube shaft for rotation about the axis and is formed axially level with the ports with respective radially throughgoing outer oil-discharge and gas-discharge ports. An oil separator inside the tube shaft axially between the oil-discharge ports and the gas-discharge ports is oriented to deflect oil particles from the stream radially outward such that the oil flows out through the inner and outer oil-discharge ports and the gas stream can flow downstream out through the gas-discharge ports.

This application is the US national stage of PCT application PCT EP2010 000230 filed 16 Jan. 2010 and published 16 Sep. 2010 with a claim to the priority of German patent application DE 10 2009 012 402.0 filed 10 Mar. 2009.

The present invention refers to a tube shaft especially to a camshaft rotatable in a bearing with an integrated oil separation device integrated into a cavity of the tube shaft the tube shaft having at least one feed opening for the introduction of oil laden gas into the cavity and at least one discharge opening for draining separated oil and gas that is freed of oil.

A tube shaft constructed as a camshaft with an integrated separation device is already known from WO 2006 119737 U.S. Pat. No. 7 717 101 where in addition to a preseparator the outer periphery of the camshaft is provided with a swirler serving as a final separator and integrated into the cavity of the camshaft.

The object of the present invention is to provide a generic type tube shaft with integrated oil separation device of construction that is as compact and space saving as possible is ensured.

According to the invention this object is achieved by a tube shaft formed with at least one radial discharge opening and the bearing has a radial discharge passage aligned with the tube shaft discharge opening. Owing to the fact that the at least one discharge opening especially the oil radial discharge opening provided on the convex surface side and advantageously all the existing discharge openings for the oil to be discharged and the gas to be discharged is or are provided in the region of a bearing surrounding the tube shaft and that the at least one discharge opening of the tube shaft corresponds to at least one corresponding discharge passage of the bearing an exceptionally space saving and compact construction of the tube shaft with integrated oil separation device is ensured. In a simple embodiment the draining of the separated oil could be carried out by one or more radial discharge openings in the tube shaft axially level with at least one discharge passage of the bearing whereas the discharging of the gas flow could be carried out axially via the open end of the tube shaft. For the preferred case in which both the draining of the oil and the discharging of the cleaned gas are to be carried out via radial discharge openings the at least one convex surface side gas discharge opening is provided downstream of the at least one convex surface side oil discharge opening as seen in the flow direction. For diverting the axially flowing air or gas flow into the radial gas discharge openings of the tube shaft wall a correspondingly designed flow guiding element is provided inside the tube shaft. This flow guiding element can be designed as a plug like component in such a way that the axially flowing gas is diverted at least in part toward the at least one gas discharge opening. To this end the flow guiding element can be essentially of a conical design and orientated by its cone point against the flow direction The flow guiding element can be of a design that is impermeable by gas or air so that the entire gas flow is diverted discharged radially outward into the gas discharge opening s by the flow guiding element. Alternatively the flow guiding element can also be designed in such a way that it axially passes through a predetermined gas or air flow in the case of a known flow pressure while the remaining portion is diverted discharged radially outward into the gas discharge openings. In another possible embodiment the flow element can also have an axial bypass channel that via a pressure dependent bypass valve for example with a spring force loaded check valve is opened when a predetermined pressure is exceeded so that when the predetermined pressure is exceeded a portion of the cleaned gas flow is discharged via the bypass valve and a remaining portion is discharged via the convex surface side gas discharge opening s .

The integrated oil separation device is advantageously of a multistage construction. In this case a first oil separation stage is advantageously formed by a so called swirler. This swirler can be designed for example as a body that extends in the cavity of the tube shaft in the axial direction and that circumferentially has at least one screw thread flight such that the screw thread flight defines a flow passage for guiding the introduced oil laden gas or oil laden or laden with oil droplets air subsequently also referred to as blow by gas or oil mist between the body of the swirler and the inner wall of the tube shaft. A second oil separation stage can be formed by an oil separation ring provided downstream of the swirler as seen in the flow direction. In this case the oil separation ring is advantageously of a solid design such that in the edge flow region of the cavity of the tube shaft it constitutes a corresponding flow obstruction for the oil enriched gas or air in this region on account of the rotation centrifugal force .

In a tube shaft rotatably supported in a bearing with an integrated oil separation device is shown in a partial longitudinal section. The bearing comprises a bearing body that can be constructed either in the form of a bearing block formed by a part of the cylinder head for example or that can be constructed as a separate component that can be fastened onto the cylinder head. For rotatable support of the tube shaft the bearing can be constructed in the form of the bearing body that on its cylindrical inner surface is designed in such a way to form a friction bearing together with a hardened region bearing section of the tube shaft . In another embodiment of the bearing it can have a multiplicity of rolling elements over its cylindrical inner surface by means of which the tube shaft that is surface hardened at least in sections is rotatably supported. In the latter case illustrated in the bearing has a seal ring by means of which the adjacent gas discharge passage is sealed relative to the region with rolling elements . As a result of this the effect of uncleaned gas being drawn into the gas discharge passage and being fed to the internal combustion engine is prevented.

The tube shaft has at least one essentially radial discharge opening for draining oil that is separated from the so called blow by gas. Thus there are radial discharge openings respectively for gas and oil and the tube shaft is supported in the region of the discharge openings by the bearing . In the region of the oil discharge openings a radial seal ring which has at least one oil passage that corresponds to the oil discharge opening and also to the oil discharge passage is provided in the bearing or in its bearing body . On its inner surface the radial seal ring has a radially inwardly open circumferential groove in which oil that is deposited on the inner wall of the tube shaft and exits through the circumferentially distributed oil discharge openings can be received and discharged via the oil passage that open into the groove. The radial seal ring which is retained circumferentially in the bearing in a friction fit and which via its sealing lips projecting radially inward toward the tube shaft surface is sealed relative to the tube shaft that rotates in the radial seal ring a reliable draining of the separated oil is ensured and drawing in of oil into the adjacent gas discharge passage is reliably prevented.

In the illustrated embodiment the tube shaft is rotatably supported in the bearing via the rolling elements . The bearing section s of the tube shaft that interact s with the rolling elements rolling bearings or with regions of the bearing body friction bearing can be constructed as a hardened and or surface treated tube shaft section or sections. If the bearing is not constructed as a friction bearing but as a rolling bearing provision is made in the bearing or in the bearing body for regions that are free of rolling elements for provision of the discharge openings for oil or for oil and gas. In the region of the tube shaft in which it interacts with the bearing or is enclosed by it provision is made for at least one radial discharge opening or discharge hole for discharging gas or oil. A plurality of holes angularly distributed around the tube shaft are advantageously provided as discharge openings for gas or oil in such a way that a ring of holes consisting of a multiplicity of angularly spaced holes is formed for discharging the cleaned blow by gases and a ring of holes is formed for draining oil separated from the blow by gas. Each radially extending discharge opening interacts in this case with a discharge passage that is formed in the bearing or in the bearing body and corresponds to the respective discharge opening . The discharge passage of the respective discharge openings is constructed inside the bearing as an annular passage with at least one corresponding radial discharge section for discharging the oil or gas that is to be discharged from the tube shaft .

In order to be able to separately discharge the blow by gas with its separated constituents having already been basically separated into its gas and oil constituents in the region of the discharge openings a flow guiding element is provided inside the cavity of the tube shaft to radially outwardly deflect the axially flowing gas into the at least one radial gas discharge opening . In this case the flow guiding element is provided with an annular seal D in order to be able to discharge all the gas fraction of the cleaned blow by gas as much as possible via the radial discharge openings . To this end the flow guiding element is designed essentially like a plug or cork and on its end face turned toward the inflowing gas has a basically centrally orientated conical extension . On the opposite end face the flow guiding element has a threaded hole . This threaded hole serves especially for simple removal of the illustrated device. In order to be able to separately drain the oil deposited by the integrated oil separation device on the inner wall of the tube shaft an oil guiding element is provided between the oil discharge opening and the at least one gas discharge opening that is downstream of the at least one oil discharge opening as seen in the flow direction S. The oil guiding element as shown in can be constructed in one piece with the flow guiding element . In another embodiment of the invention as shown in the oil guiding element can be designed as a separate component in the form of a separation ring provided between the gas discharge openings and the oil discharge openings

The integrated oil separation device advantageously comprises at least two differently acting oil separation elements. In this case a first oil separation element is designed in the form of a so called swirler not shown for example whereas a second oil separation element is constructed in the form of an oil separation ring that is downstream of the first oil separation element as seen in the flow direction S. As a result of the geometric arrangement of the oil separation ring which is provided directly upstream of the oil discharge opening as seen in the flow direction S and of the oil guiding element provided directly downstream of the oil discharge opening but still upstream of the gas discharge opening as seen in the flow direction S a calm flow d region is formed. On account of the calm flow region efficient draining of oil and also improved separation or maintaining of the separation between the clean gas constituents and the separated oil constituents can be achieved.

In a possible embodiment of an oil separation ring is shown in each case. According to the oil separation ring is essentially of solid design and constitutes a large flow obstruction in the form of an impingement element for the flow of the blow by gas near the inner wall of the tube shaft . The oil particles suspended in the blow by gas cannot follow the quick change of direction around the oil separation ring impinge against the end face of the oil separation ring and so are separated out from the oil mist. The oil separation ring has a multiplicity of axially extending recesses via which the oil particles deposited on the wall side or the oil film formed therefrom on the wall surface can flow further in the flow direction S toward the oil discharge opening

The oil separation ring advantageously has a system of interconnected cavities so that a labyrinth of cavities that extend through the oil separation ring is formed. The end face of the oil separation ring additionally constitutes an impingement element whereas the inner labyrinth is a combination of impingement and deflection elements. By means of these impingement and deflection elements lighter oil particles are also separated out from the oil mist so that the oil mist that flows downstream of the oil separation ring as seen in the flow direction S can be considered to be cleaned gas or cleaned air. Materials for the aforesaid configurations of the oil separation ring may be for example porous plastics or synthetic materials. The oil separation ring preferably also comprises a plastic mesh and or metal mesh that forms or form a large number of cavities and labyrinths in which case the oil separation ring then preferably comprises a support ring that is supports the mesh and moreover serves for fixing the mesh in the cavity of the tube shaft .

In one embodiment of the oil separation ring as illustrated in the oil separation ring comprises a perforated sheet metal ring. Such an oil separation ring advantageously comprises a multiplicity of sheet metal rings that are arranged in series and rotated or offset relative to each other with the respective hole rows or hole patterns and that are spaced apart and interconnected via circumferential connecting elements . As a result of the offset or the angular offset of the individual sheet metal rings relative to each other and the corresponding spacing apart of the individual sheet metal rings a corresponding labyrinth is created for separating oil from the blow by gas that flows through the oil separation ring .
