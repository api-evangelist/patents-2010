title: Method of converting bomblet to hand grenade
abstract: A method of converting a bomblet into a hand-thrown grenade may include providing a bomblet having a fuze, a shaped-charge liner, a casing, and explosive material disposed between the shaped-charge liner and the casing. The fuze may be removed from the bomblet. A housing may be attached a fuze end of the bomblet. The housing may adjoin the casing. A cavity that abuts and is exterior to the shaped-charge liner may be filled with a filler material, such as pellets. A hand-grenade fuze may be attached to the fuze end of the bomblet.

Some large gun launched projectiles such as 155 mm projectiles may carry many submunitions or bomblets that may be expelled in flight. Each bomblet may be independently stablized and armed. One type of bomblet may include a point detonating fuze that detonates the bomblet on impact. Detonation of the bomblet may send anti personnel fragments radially and may send a shaped charge jet downward. A large number of gun launched projectiles that contain bomblets may no longer be used. Thus there may be millions of surplus bomblets.

If the surplus bomblets are destroyed the large original capital investment in the bomblets will be lost. And the process of de militarizing the bomblets is another large cost. A need exists for a cost effective method of converting surplus bomblets into useful products.

It is an object of the invention to provide a cost effective method for converting surplus bomblets into useful products.

One aspect of the invention is a method of converting a bomblet into a hand thrown grenade. The bomblet may included a fuze a shaped charge liner a casing and explosive material disposed between the shaped charge liner and the casing. The method may include removing the fuze from the bomblet and attaching a housing to a fuze end of the bomblet. The housing may adjoin the casing. A cavity that abuts and is exterior to the shaped charge liner may be filled with a filler material. A hand grenade fuze may be attached to the fuze end of the bomblet.

The bomblet may include studs that were used to stake the bomblet fuze to the bomblet. The housing may include openings therein for receiving the studs. The housing may be attached by re staking the studs to fix the housing in place. The housing may abut the shoulder of the casing. The housing may have a central opening therein. One end of the central opening may include internal threads.

The method may include placing a stab detonator in the central opening in the housing. The hand grenade fuze may be inserted in the central opening in the housing.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A known Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition DPICM bomblet may be converted into a hand grenade that may be thrown by soldiers. The process of converting the known DPICM bomblet into a hand grenade may be about 30 to 40 cheaper than purchasing a new hand grenade.

A housing may be attached to the fuze end of bomblet . Housing may adjoin casing and may abut shoulder of casing . Housing may include openings formed therein for receiving studs . Housing may include a central opening formed therein. Opening may include internal threads at one end. Housing may be made of for example plastic metal or epoxy. Housing may be fixed in placed on casing by inserting studs in openings in housing and resting the bottom of housing on shoulder . Interior holes in studs may be used to stake studs and secure housing in place.

The method may include filling cavity with a filler material. Filler material may include pellets such as steel buckshot. Pellets may impart increased lethality to hand grenade . Pellets may be held in a matrix such as a polymer matrix that may be fixed to the exterior surface of liner using for example an adhesive. Filler material may also include for example sand epoxy or plastic or other suitable materials.

A stab detonator may be placed in central opening in housing . Stab detonator may be for example an M55 stab detonator. As shown in a hand grenade fuze may then be inserted in central opening in housing . Fuze may include external threads for engaging internal threads formed in one end of central opening . Fuze may be for example an M218 hand grenade fuze.

The novel method uses a bomblet designed for use in artillery projectiles and converts the bomblet into a hand thrown grenade for the infantry. The method may save the cost of demilitarizing millions of bomblets and the cost of procuring new hand grenade warheads. In addition the method may recover sunken costs in existing hardware.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
