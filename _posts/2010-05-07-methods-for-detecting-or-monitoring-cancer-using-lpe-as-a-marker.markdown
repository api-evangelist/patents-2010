This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. R01 CA106414 awarded by the National Institutes of Health NIH . The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Methods for detecting a cancer such as ovarian cancer are disclosed herein. Also discussed herein are methods for monitoring a cancer such as ovarian cancer. More particularly disclosed herein are methods for detecting ovarian cancer in a test subject by determining the amount of a lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine LPE in a sample of a bodily fluid taken from the test subject. The methods discussed herein are particularly useful as a screening test for ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest cancers for women due to its high fatality rate. In the United States in 2007 it was estimated that 22 430 women would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 15 280 women would die of ovarian cancer. Unfortunately heretofore only 25 of ovarian cancer patients were diagnosed at stage I. Most of the patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage stage III or IV at which the 5 year survival rate decreases to 20 to 25 from 95 at stage I.

Presently the most commonly used biomarker for diagnosing ovarian cancer is CA 125 a group of surface glycoproteins with uncertain biological function. Although CA 125 is elevated in 82 of women with advanced ovarian cancer it has very limited clinical application for the detection of early stage disease exhibiting a positive predictive value of less than 10 . The addition of physical examination by diagnostic ultrasound improves the positive predictive value to 20 which is still too low to meet the requirement for cancer detection. Developing a clinical test to diagnose ovarian cancer with high sensitivity and specificity at the early stage has become the most urgent issue in battling this refractory disease.

Frequently the detection of cancer depends upon the detection and inspection of a tumor mass which has reached sufficient size to be detected by physical examination. The detection of molecular markers of carcinogenesis and tumor growth can solve many of the problems associated with the physical examination of tumors. Samples taken from the patient for screening by molecular techniques are typically blood or urine and thus require minimally invasive techniques. Thus they can be used on a regular basis to screen for cancers. In addition because molecular markers may appear before the tumor reaches a detectable size it is possible to detect cancers at very early stages in the progression of the disease.

Biomarkers identified from serum proteomic analysis for the detection of ovarian cancer are discussed in Z. Zhang et al. 64 5882 5890 Aug. 15 2004.

The above objects as well as other objects advantages and aims are satisfied by the present invention.

The present invention concerns a method of detecting a cancer for example ovarian cancer in a test subject comprising 

 a determining the amount of a lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine in a sample of a bodily fluid taken from the test subject and

 b comparing the amount of the lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine in the sample of the bodily fluid taken from the test subject to a range of amounts found in samples of the bodily fluid taken from a group of normal subjects of the same species as the test subject and lacking the cancer for example if the bodily fluid taken from the test subject is serum then the bodily fluid taken from each member of the group of normal subjects will also be serum whereby a change in the amount such as a lower amount of the lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine in the sample of the bodily fluid taken from the test subject indicates the presence of the cancer for example ovarian cancer .

The present invention further concerns a method for monitoring a cancer for example ovarian cancer in a test subject over time comprising 

 a determining the amount of a lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine in a sample of a bodily fluid taken from the test subject at a first time

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.

Applicants have discovered that the lipid lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine LPE can be used in the methods disclosed herein for detecting a cancer such as ovarian cancer and monitoring a cancer such as ovarian cancer in a test subject.

Non limiting examples of the lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine that can be used in the methods disclosed herein include the following 18 0 LPE 18 1 LPE 18 2 LPE 16 0 LPE 22 6 LPE and 20 4 LPE.

The molecule weights chemical names and structures for 16 0 LPE 18 0 LPE 18 1 LPE 18 2 LPE 20 4 LPE and 22 6 LPE are as follows 

In an embodiment of the invention an amount of a lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine LPE found in a sample of a bodily fluid taken from a test subject is compared to the amount of the LPE found samples taken from normal subjects of the same species as the test subject lacking a cancer for example ovarian cancer e.g. if the test subject is a human then the normal subject is a human who does not have the cancer for example ovarian cancer . Thus the amount of a LPE taken from a test subject e.g. a female is determined and a range of amounts of LPE taken from normal females e.g. lacking ovarian cancer is obtained. A lower amount of the LPE found in the sample of the bodily fluid taken from the test subject when compared to a range of amounts of the LPE in samples of the bodily fluid taken from a group of normal subjects of the same species as the test subject and lacking the cancer for example ovarian cancer indicates the presence of the cancer for example ovarian cancer .

The amount of the LPE detected in the sample taken from a test subject may be measured by first extracting lipids as described in detail infra. The amount of the LPE is then quantified using standard procedures such as mass spectroscopy gas chromatography HPLC NMR or other approaches.

In addition to the direct measurement of the LPE by extraction antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies reactive with the LPE can be used in an assay to detect the amount of the LPE. For example anti LPE antibodies may be labeled using standard procedures and used in assays including radioimmunoassay RIA both solid and liquid phase fluorescence linked assays or enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA wherein the antibody is used to detect the presence and amount of the LPE.

The test subject can be a eukaryotic organism preferably a vertebrate including but not limited to a mammal a bird a fish an amphibian or a reptile. Preferably the subject is a mammal most preferably a human. The bodily fluid includes but is not limited to plasma serum urine saliva ascites cerebral spinal fluid or pleural fluid. Preferably the bodily fluid is plasma or a serum which is obtained from a whole blood specimen from the test subject.

The methods disclosed herein can be used to detect screen or monitor for a broad range of cancers at an early stage. Such cancers include gynecological cancers including ovarian cancer breast cancer cervical cancer uterine cancer endometrial cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer and vulva cancer. Other cancers that can be detected screened or monitored according to the methods disclosed herein include but are not limited to testicular cancer colon cancer lung cancer prostate cancer bladder cancer kidney cancer thyroid cancer stomach cancer pancreatic cancer brain cancer liver cancer ureter cancer esophageal cancer and larynx cancer. The methods disclosed herein are preferably directed to detecting ovarian cancer.

The methods disclosed herein are non invasive and require only a bodily fluid specimen such as a blood specimen from the test subject patient . Thus such methods are particularly useful for screening patients who have not been previously diagnosed as having ovarian cancer. Such patients include women at elevated risk by virtue of a family history of the disease premenopausal women with anovulatory cycles and postmenopausal women. The methods disclosed herein include a screening test for identifying within a risk population a subject population with a greater propensity for developing ovarian cancer.

The methods disclosed herein can provide a number of benefits. First the methods provide a rapid and economical screen for large numbers of subjects to promote early diagnosis of ovarian cancer which can result in improved quality of life and better survival rates for patients.

Using the methods disclosed herein for prognosis the medical professional can determine whether a subject having ovarian cancer in the early stages requires therapy or does not require therapy. This could also identify subjects who may not benefit from a particular form of therapy e.g. surgery chemotherapy radiation or biological therapies. Such information could result in an improved therapy design for obtaining better responses to therapy.

The methods disclosed herein can also be used to identify patients for whom therapy should be altered from one therapeutic agent to another. This could obviate the need for second look invasive procedures to determine the patient s response to the therapy and facilitate decisions as to whether the particular type of therapy should be continued terminated or altered.

Because cancers may recur in a significant number of patients with advanced cancers early detection and continued monitoring over time using the methods disclosed herein can identify early occult i.e. hidden recurrences prior to symptoms presenting themselves.

In addition methods disclosed herein will facilitate distinguishing benign from malignant tumors. Masses in the ovary can be initially detected using procedures such as ultrasound or by physical examination. Thereafter the methods disclosed herein can be used to diagnose the presence of a cancer for example ovarian cancer . This could obviate the need for surgical intervention and or identify subjects for whom continued monitoring is appropriate resulting in improved early detection and survival for ovarian cancer patients.

LPE in plasma was extracted using a modified Bligh Dyer method which follows the following procedure First mix 200 pmol 14 0 LPE with 200 l plasma. The mixture was vortexed and 2 ml 2 1 v v methanol chloroform was added. The mixture was vortexed again and kept at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then it was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 10 C. for 10 minutes. The top liquid layer was transferred into another tube and dried under nitrogen. The dried pellet was dissolved in 200 l 100 mM ammonium acetate in methanol and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 minutes. 50 l of the supernatant was injected and analyzed by LC ESI MS MS.

LC ESI MS MS analysis of LPE species was performed using a Quattro Micro mass spectrometer Micromass Altrincham U.K. equipped with an electrospray ionization ESI probe and interfaced with a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp HPLC system Shimadzu Tokyo Japan . Lipids were separated with a Betabasic 18 column 20 2.1 mm 5 m Thermo Electron Waltham Mass. protected by a Betabasic 18 pre column 10 2.1 mm 5 m Thermo Electron Waltham Mass. . 1 mM ammonium acetate aqueous solution was used as mobile phase A and 1 mM ammonium acetate in methanol was used as mobile phase B. The flow rate was 200 l minute. The gradient used was as follows the column was first equilibrated with 50 B 50 A followed by a linear change from 50 B 50 A to 100 B 0 A in the first 4 minutes. The gradient was kept at 100 B in the following 8 minutes. In the following 4 minutes the gradient was changed back to 50 B 50 A to re equilibrate the column. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed online using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the negative multiple reaction monitoring MRM mode. The MS parameters are capillary voltage 3.0 KV cone voltage 35 V source temperature 100 C. desolvation temperature 350 C. flow rate of desolvation gas 500 L hr flow rate of cone gas 50 L hr mass resolution of both parent and daughter ions 15.0 multiplier 650.
