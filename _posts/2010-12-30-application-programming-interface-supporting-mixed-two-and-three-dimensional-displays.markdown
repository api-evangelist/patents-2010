title: Application programming interface supporting mixed two and three dimensional displays
abstract: Application programming interfaces (APIs) are provided that enable applications to display two-dimensional and three-dimensional content in regions of a display screen. A first command is received from an application directing at least in part a first configuration of a first region of the screen to support the three-dimensional content. The first command is responded to by sending a first configuration request to place the screen in a three-dimensional mode within the first region. A second command is received directing at least in part a second configuration of a second region of the screen to support the two-dimensional content. The second command is responded to by sending a second configuration request to place the screen in mode corresponding to a two-dimensional mode within the second region.

The present invention relates to application programming interfaces associated with applications that provide three dimensional content.

Images may be generated for display in various forms. For instance television TV is a widely used telecommunication medium for transmitting and displaying images in monochromatic black and white or color form. Conventionally images are provided in analog form and are displayed by display devices in two dimensions. More recently images are being provided in digital form for display in two dimensions on display devices having improved resolution e.g. high definition or HD . Even more recently images capable of being displayed in three dimensions are being generated.

Conventional displays may use a variety of techniques to achieve three dimensional image viewing functionality. For example various types of glasses have been developed that may be worn by users to view three dimensional images displayed by a conventional display. Examples of such glasses include glasses that utilize color filters or polarized filters. In each case the lenses of the glasses pass two dimensional images of differing perspective to the user s left and right eyes. The images are combined in the visual center of the brain of the user to be perceived as a three dimensional image. In another example synchronized left eye right eye LCD liquid crystal display shutter glasses may be used with conventional two dimensional displays to create a three dimensional viewing illusion. In still another example LCD display glasses are being used to display three dimensional images to a user. The lenses of the LCD display glasses include corresponding displays that provide images of differing perspective to the user s eyes to be perceived by the user as three dimensional.

Some displays are configured for viewing three dimensional without the user having to wear special glasses such as by using techniques of autostereoscopy. For example a display may include a parallax barrier that has a layer of material with a series of precision slits. The parallax barrier is placed proximal to a display so that a user s eyes each see a different set of pixels to create a sense of depth through parallax. Another type of display for viewing three dimensional images is one that includes a lenticular lens. A lenticular lens includes an array of magnifying lenses configured so that when viewed from slightly different angles different images are magnified. Displays are being developed that use lenticular lenses to enable autostereoscopic images to be generated.

As such many types of display devices exist that are capable of displaying three dimensional images and further types are being developed. Different types of displays that enable three dimensional image viewing may have different capabilities and attributes including having different depth resolutions being configured for three dimensional image viewing only being switchable between two dimensional image viewing and three dimensional image viewing and further capabilities and attributes. Furthermore different types of applications may be configured to provide and or interact with the displays to provide either two dimensional or three dimensional image content. However each application may not be directly compatible with each type of display device.

Methods systems and apparatuses are described for application programming interfaces that interface applications with display devices that have three dimensional image display capability substantially as shown in and or described herein in connection with at least one of the figures as set forth more completely in the claims.

The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally the left most digit s of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.

The present specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of the invention. The disclosed embodiment s merely exemplify various aspects of the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment s . The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.

References in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an example embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

Furthermore it should be understood that spatial descriptions e.g. above below up left right down top bottom vertical horizontal etc. used herein are for purposes of illustration only and that practical implementations of the structures described herein can be spatially arranged in any orientation or manner.

The present invention relates to an application programming interface API that provides support for the display of mixed two dimensional and three dimensional content. In embodiments APIs interface applications and display devices enabling the applications to configure screens of the display devices for the display of mixed 2D and 3D content. For instance an API may include a vocabulary and a calling convention that a programmer of an application may use to pass commands from the application to a device driver configured to control the display of content. The vocabulary and calling convention may be used to define a region e.g. a window a frame etc. within which to display video content and to specify one or more parameters to be associated with the region. The parameters can specify for example one or more of a type of video content that will be displayed within the region e.g. 2D stereoscopic 3D or a particular type of multi view 3D a desired orientation of the video content within the region a brightness contrast to be associated with the region and or a video resolution to be associated with the region. When the device driver receives a configuration request or set of configuration requests that define such a region and also specifies parameters associated with the region the display driver controls driver circuitry associated with the display so that the defined region is opened on the display and video content is presented therein in a manner that is consistent with the associated parameters. A user interface may also be provided along with the device driver that allows a user to associate parameters with a region by issuing commands in accordance with the API. The API may include a standard API that is used to provide an abstraction layer for interacting with a plurality of different display devices produced by different manufacturers.

In embodiments an API may enable a display device to display images video and further types of content in two dimensions and three dimensions that are provided by applications. Such content may be received and processed by applications or may be internally generated by applications. Numerous types of display devices may display 2D and 3D content as configured through an API. For example the display devices may include one or more light manipulators such as parallax barriers and or lenticular lenses to deliver 3D media content in the form of images or views to the eyes of the viewers. Other types may include display devices with 3D display pixel constructs e.g. multiple layers of pixels that can be illuminated in the different layers to provide depth that may or may not employ such light manipulators. When used light manipulators may be fixed or dynamically modified to change the manner in which the views are delivered. For instance embodiments enable light manipulators that are adaptable to accommodate a changing viewer sweet spot switching between two dimensional 2D stereoscopic three dimensional 3D and multi view 3D views as well as the simultaneous display of 2D stereoscopic 3D and multi view 3D content. With regard to parallax barriers example features that may be dynamically modified include one or more of a number of slits in the parallax barriers the dimensions of each slit the spacing between the slits and the orientation of the slits. Slits of the parallax barriers may also be turned on or off in relation to certain regions of the screen such that simultaneous mixed 2D stereoscopic 3D and multi view 3D presentations can be accommodated. Similarly a lenticular lens may be dynamically modified such as by modifying a width of the lenticular lens to modify delivered images.

The following subsections describe numerous exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For instance the next subsection describes embodiments for APIs followed by a subsection that describes embodiments for displaying content using APIs a subsection that describes example displays a subsection that describes example display environments and a subsection that describes example electronic devices. It noted that the section subsection headings provided herein are not intended to be limiting. Embodiments are described throughout this document and any type of embodiment may be included under any section subsection.

It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and detail can be made to the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of exemplary embodiments described herein.

In embodiments application programming interfaces APIs that are configured to enable applications to display mixed content are provided. An application may generate a command in the form of a call to configure a display screen region e.g. a window or frame in which image or video content can be displayed. The command is received by an API and processed by the API according to a calling convention for the particular call. The command may specify one or more parameters for the screen region. The parameters can specify for example one or more of a type of video content to be displayed within the screen region e.g. 2D stereoscopic 3D or a particular type of multi view 3D a desired display orientation of the video content within the screen region a brightness contrast to be associated with the screen region a video resolution to be associated with the screen region e.g. 720p 1080p etc. and or further parameters described herein. The parameters to be associated with a screen region may be specified programmatically or determined dynamically at run time. The parameters may also be modified at run time by a user through a user control interface provided by the screen region. The API may process the call to provide configuration information to a device driver so that a region is opened on the display and the video content is presented therein in a manner that is consistent with the associated parameters.

For instance shows a block diagram of a display system according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in system includes a display device an application and an API . System is a system where API configures display device for display of content according to commands calls from application and provides content to display device for display. System is described as follows.

System may be implemented in one or more devices. For example in one embodiment application API and display device may be implemented in a common electronic device that may be accessed by a user such as a mobile computing device e.g. a handheld computer a laptop computer a notebook computer a tablet computer e.g. an Apple iPad a netbook etc. a mobile phone e.g. a cell phone a smart phone a mobile email device some types of televisions etc. In another embodiment as shown in application and API may be implemented in an electronic device that is separate from display device . For instance device may be a home theater system receiver a set top box a computer a game console or other such device and display device may be a display device that is coupled to device in a wired or wireless fashion.

Application may be any type of application that is capable of generating and or processing content for display. For instance application may be implemented in software e.g. computer programs and or data that runs on a device. Application may generate or receive an image file a video file or stream or other item of content. For instance application may be a media player that is configured to load and or read a content file and or stream and to display the associated content. Application may receive the content from a local storage device over a network e.g. a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or a combination of communication networks such as the Internet or may receive the content from another source. Alternatively application may be a graphics application and or any other form of application that generates its own content for display. Application may make calls to API to configure one or more screen regions of a display screen of display device for display of content and may transmit the content for display in the region s . Example description of implementations of programming languages for application and other applications described herein is provided in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 982 156 titled Programming Architecture Supporting Mixed Two And Three Dimensional Displays filed on same date herewith which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety although application and further applications described herein are not limited to such implementations.

API is an interface for applications such as application . API enables the applications to interact with display device . API receives calls from applications to configure regions of the screen of display device for display of content. API may receive content from the applications that includes graphics information and may be configured to perform graphics operations on the graphics information received from the applications. API may be implemented in a same device as application or a separate device. API may be a special purpose API or may include features of a commercially available API such as Microsoft DirectX e.g. Direct3D OpenGL or other 3D graphics API which may be modified according to embodiments to receive commands and or content from application . API may be implemented in software e.g. computer program code or logic hardware firmware or a combination thereof.

As shown in API includes mixed 2D 3D supporting programming elements . Mixed 2D 3D supporting programming elements may be maintained in the form of a library and may be coded in a programming language compiled or un compiled that enables API to support display of mixed 2D and 3D content according to an exemplary embodiment. For example programming elements may enable API to configure and or provide two and three dimensional content for display by display devices that are capable of separately displaying two dimensional and three dimensional content display devices that are capable of simultaneously displaying two dimensional and three dimensional content display devices that are capable of simultaneously displaying different types of three dimensional content as well as display devices that can adaptively change the display of two dimensional and three dimensional contents e.g. by modifying display screen regions etc. .

For example 2D 3D supporting programming elements may be capable of enabling application to display 2D and 3D content at display device in a manner based on the content itself and or based on one or more commands and or parameters provided with the commands. For instance API may support commands for configuring display screen regions for display of 2D or 3D content including one or more types of 3D content. Specific commands may be provided by application to configure screen regions e.g. a configure screen for3D4 command etc. and or one or more parameters may be included with commands calls that indicate types and characteristics of 2D and 3D content and or the screen regions in which the content is to be displayed. For example a command and or a parameter may indicate whether the content is to be displayed as 2D or 3D. Further commands and or parameters may be defined to indicate various types of three dimensional content such as 3D 4 to indicate 3D multiview content with four camera views 3D 8 to indicate 3D multiview content with eight camera views 3D HVGA to indicate three dimensional HVGA half size VGA etc. Any number of commands and or parameters may be available to indicate one or more 3D display characteristics such as stereoscopic depth e.g. a depth parameter brightness e.g. a brightness parameter a size of a region of a screen in which the 3D content is to be displayed e.g. a regionsize parameter having attributes such as row column width and height parameters a resolution parameter e.g. a resolution parameter a window orientation parameter indicating whether image content is to be displayed vertically or rotated by 90 degrees or by other amount e.g. an orientation parameter a window shape or freeform window parameter indicating a non rectangular shape for the displayed content e.g. a freeform parameter a display region type parameter e.g. a window a frame a tab etc. . Programmers may be enabled to use such commands and or parameters compatible with a calling convention of API to define application to display 2D and or 3D content.

For instance an example command that may be received by API for configuring a screen region is provided as follows 

The example command shown above is a command for configuring a region of a display screen. As shown above the command includes five parameters including a display type parameter that is 3D 4 in this example a freeform parameter having a value of default that indicates the region should be rectangular shaped a region size parameter that defines a region location having an upper left region corner at coordinates 0 0 and a region size of 100 by 200 pixels a brightness parameter of 80 of full brightness and an orientation parameter indicating the displayed content is to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. The parameters shown above for the configure screen region command are provided for purposes of illustration and the command may have additional and or alternative parameters that are described herein or otherwise known. Furthermore additional and or alternative commands for a programming language to support configuring and displaying mixed 2D and 3D content in further ways may be formed in a similar manner as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein. In an embodiment such a command may be received by API and a call to a programming element of programming elements may be made based on the command to enable a function of configuring a display screen region according to the command.

In embodiments display device may be one of a variety of display devices capable of displaying two dimensional and or three dimensional content. For instance shows a block diagram of a display system which is an exemplary embodiment of system of . As shown in system includes application API a first display device and a second display device . As shown in API includes mixed 2D 3D supporting programming elements . First display device is a display device that is only capable of displaying two dimensional content and second display device is a display device that is capable of display two dimensional content and three dimensional content. In the example of via mixed 2D 3D supporting programming elements API is capable of enabling application to display content at first and second display devices and . In embodiments application may be capable of providing content for display by first and second display devices and through API one at a time. In another embodiment application may be capable of providing content for display by first and second display devices and and or other combinations and numbers of display devices through API simultaneously.

Note that API may interface with display devices in various ways. For instance shows a block diagram of API interfacing with display device of in various ways according to embodiments. As shown in API can be interfaced with display device through an operating system OS and display driver and or directly through display driver . is described as follows.

OS provides a platform on which programs may be executed such as application . API may be separate from OS or may be integrated in OS . OS may be implemented in software e.g. computer programs and or data that runs on a device or in other manner. OS manages hardware provides common services enables execution of applications and enables applications to access hardware such as display device . OS may include a user interface such as a graphical user interface GUI which a user may interact with to access applications and or display device . OS may be a commercially available or proprietary operating system. For instance OS may be an operating system such as Microsoft Windows Apple Mac OS X Google Android or Linux which may be modified according to embodiments. Further description of implementations of OS and other operating system implementations described herein is provided in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 982 124 titled Operating System Supporting Mixed 2D Stereoscopic 3D And Multi View 3D Display filed on same date herewith which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Display driver may be implemented in software and enables applications e.g. higher level application code and API to interact with display device . Display driver may be implemented in a same or different device as API . Multiple display drivers may be present and each display driver is typically display device specific although some display drivers may be capable of driving multiple types of display devices. Each type of display device typically is controlled by its own display device specific commands. In contrast most applications communicate with display devices according to high level device generic commands. Display driver accepts the generic high level commands from applications via API and or OS and breaks them into a series of low level display device specific commands as used by the particular display device.

In an application may generate a command associated with the display of 2D and or 3D content that is received by API . In one embodiment API processes the command and generates a configuration request that is received by OS . OS passes configuration request to display driver in a modified or unmodified form . Display driver receives configuration request and generates one or more control signals received by display device . Control signal s place s a screen of display device in a display mode corresponding to configuration request . Furthermore the application may stream content to display device through API OS and display driver to be displayed in the screen configured according to configuration request .

In another example API may generate a configuration request based on the command from the application that is directly received by display driver e.g. does not pass through OS . Display driver receives configuration request and generates control signal s received by display device . Control signal s place s a screen of display device in a display mode corresponding to configuration request . Furthermore the application may stream content to display device through API and display driver to be displayed by the screen configured according to command .

As such commands and content may be provided by applications to display device through API and optionally one or more additional intermediate components which may include OS and display driver .

API may be executed in an electronic device. For instance shows a block diagram of an electronic device according to an exemplary embodiment. Device is an example of either of devices and shown in . As shown in device includes API . Device may include additional features that are not shown in for ease of illustration. Display device may be included in or may be external to device . Device may be any of the electronic devices mentioned herein or may be an alternative device.

API is an example of API described above. As shown in API includes a programming library . Programming library provides a library of functions that may be called by applications to configure 2D and 3D display screen regions. As shown in programming library includes programming elements . Programming elements include programming sequences . Each programming element of programming library has a calling convention according to which a command from an application may be configured to access the function of the particular programming element . A programming sequence of a programming element may be triggered by a call from an application to perform particular functionality such as the placement of a screen region of a display in a corresponding 2D or 3D configuration. For instance programming sequences may be present to configure a screen region according to any of the commands and or parameters described above or elsewhere herein. For instance a programming sequence may generate a configuration request based on the command parameters that includes information for configuring a display screen for display of 2D or 3D content configuring the display screen for display of a particular type of three dimensional content configuring one or more 3D display characteristics such as stereoscopic depth brightness region size resolution orientation window shape display region type parameter and or other configuration a display screen in other ways. The call to a programming sequence may include the parameters of the command received from an application. Programming sequences may generate configuration requests to cause screen regions to be displayed according to the commands parameters. For example the configuration requests may be received by display drivers that generate corresponding control signals configured to set up screen regions according to the attributes of the configuration requests.

Device may be configured in various ways to perform its functions and various embodiments for device are described herein. For instance shows a block diagram of a display system that includes an API configured to support display of 2D and 3D content according to an embodiment. API is an embodiment of API that is capable of configuring display devices for display of two dimensional content and or three dimensional content and to supply such content from applications to the display devices.

Furthermore 3Dx display with 2D mode may be capable of displaying 3D content having multiple camera views multiview a number of x views such as 3D 4 having four camera views 3D 16 having sixteen camera views etc. The additional camera views enable viewers to view behind displayed 3D content by moving their heads left right as further described elsewhere herein. Regionally configurable 2D 3Dx display is an example of 2D 3D display device of and is a display device that is capable of displaying two dimensional and three dimensional content simultaneously. For instance regionally configurable 2D 3Dx display may display 2D content in one or more regions of a display screen while simultaneously displaying 3D content in one or more other regions of the display screen. Furthermore regionally configurable 2D 3Dx display may be capable of displaying 3D content having multiple camera views.

Subsequently to the first and second regions of screen being configured according to first and second configuration requests and 3D and 2D content may be transmitted by application to API for display by screen . For instance shows a flowchart providing a process for an API to provide content for display according to an exemplary embodiment. Flowchart may be performed by APIs described elsewhere herein such as API of API of and API of . Flowchart is described as follows with respect to API of for illustrative purposes.

As described above for three dimensional content images of differing perspective are delivered to the right and left eyes of a viewer. The images are combined in the visual center of the brain of the viewer to be perceived as a three dimensional image. Thus 3D content includes left and right images or image streams to be displayed to the left and right eyes of a viewer respectively. In the case of 3D 4 or further numbers of camera views 3D content may include multiple pairs of left right image streams. As shown in 3D content is received by 3Dx region rendering programming sequence . Programming sequence processes 3D content e.g. processes each image stream and outputs 3D graphical data that defines the 3D content. Display driver may receive 3D graphical data and transmit corresponding processed 3D graphical data that is received by display device . Display device may display the 3D content of processed 3D graphical data in the first region of screen which is configured according to first configuration request .

In step the display of two dimensional content is enabled within the second region of the screen. For instance the second content which may be two dimensional or three dimensional content may be internally generated by second application or received from an external source and processed by application . As shown above second application transmits e.g. streams 2D content to API . As described above for two dimensional content same images are delivered to the right and left eyes of a viewer so that the content is perceived as two dimensional. Thus 2D content may include a single image or image stream. As shown in 2D content is received by 2D region rendering programming sequence . Programming sequence processes 2D content and outputs 2D graphical data that defines the 2D content. Display driver may receive 2D graphical data and transmit corresponding processed 2D graphical data that is received by display device . Display device may display the 2D content of processed 2D graphical data in the second region of screen which is configured according to second configuration request .

As such according to flowcharts two dimensional and three dimensional content provided by one or more applications may be enabled to be simultaneously displayed within corresponding regions of a display screen by API . Furthermore different types of three dimensional content e.g. different resolutions different numbers of image pairs different stereoscopic depths etc. are enabled to be individually or simultaneously displayed. In embodiments any number of different types of two dimensional and three dimensional content may be displayed in any number of regions of screen .

For instance A and B show examples of screen displaying content in various screen regions according to embodiments. shows screen including a first region and a background region .

As shown in background region has a size that is approximately the full display area of screen and first region has a smaller size filling a rectangular space imposed on background region . For instance in one embodiment provided for purposes of illustration background region may be a three dimensional desktop region displayed on a computer screen and first region may be a window generated by an application displaying two dimensional content in the desktop region. In another embodiment background region may correspond to three dimensional television content while first region is a picture in picture region generated by an application that displays two dimensional television content overlaid on background region .

As shown in background region has a size that is approximately the full display area of screen first region has a smaller size filling a rectangular space imposed on background region and second region also has a smaller size filling an elliptical space imposed on background region adjacent to first region . Similarly to background region may be a two dimensional or three dimensional desktop region of a computer screen a two dimensional or three dimensional television screen region etc. First and second regions and may be both generated by a same application e.g. application one of applications etc. that has mixed 2D and 3D display capability or by first and second applications e.g. first and second applications and of . First region may be a window displaying two dimensional content in the desktop region in a picture in picture region etc. and second region may be a window displaying three dimensional content in the desktop region in a picture in picture region etc. In the example of first and second regions and are not in contact with each other. In another embodiment first and second regions and may be in contact with each other or overlapping. Furthermore one or more additional screen regions may be present that display 2D or 3D content provided by the application.

It is noted that the examples of A and B are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting.

As described above 2D region rendering programming sequence and 3D region rendering programming sequence are configured to receive and render 2D and 3D content respectively from applications for display by one or more of displays . In an embodiment one or both of programming sequences and may implement a graphics pipeline model for rendering 2D and 3D displays respectively. For instance shows a block diagram of programming library of according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in programming elements of programming library include a graphics pipeline . Graphics pipeline is configured to render mixed 2D and 3D content and may be implemented by one or both of programming sequences and

Graphics pipeline may render 2D and or 3D content in various ways. For instance content received from applications e.g. 3D content and 2D content of may include the content in the form of primitives and graphics pipeline may process the primitives to generate corresponding content for display. In alternative embodiments content may be received and processed in other forms.

In an embodiment graphics pipeline may include one or more of the stages or modules described as follows. For example graphics pipeline may include a transformation module that consumes data about polygons with vertices edges and faces that constitute a whole scene. A matrix may control linear transformations scaling rotation translation etc. and viewing transformations world and view space that are to be applied on the data. Graphics pipeline may include a vertex shader configured to perform per vertex lighting. Geometry in a complete 3D scene may be lit according to the defined locations of light sources and reflectance and other surface properties. Lighting at vertices may be generated by the vertex shader and values between vertices may be interpolated during rasterization. Per fragment i.e. per pixel lighting can be performed as a post rasterization process e.g. by a shader program . Graphics pipeline may include a viewing transformer module that transforms objects from 3D world space coordinates into a 3D coordinate system based on the position and orientation of a virtual camera. This results in the original 3D scene being generated as seen from the camera s point of view defined in an eye space or camera space. Graphics pipeline may include a primitives generator that generates new primitives provided from primitives that were sent to the beginning of graphics pipeline .

Graphics pipeline may include a projection transformer. In the case of a perspective projection objects which are distant from the camera are made smaller sheared . In an orthographic projection objects retain their original size regardless of distance from the camera. Geometry may be transformed from the eye space of the rendering camera into a special 3D coordinate space called Homogeneous Clip Space which is convenient for clipping. The projection transformer is responsible for mapping the planes of the camera s viewing volume or Frustum to the planes of the box which makes up clip space. Graphics pipeline may include a clipping module. Geometric primitives that fall outside of the viewing frustum are not be visible and thus may be discarded by clipping performed by the clipping module. Clipping is not necessary to achieve a correct image output but can accelerate the rendering process by eliminating the unneeded rasterization and post processing of primitives that are not visible anyway.

Graphics pipeline may include a viewport transformer. The post clip vertices may be transformed by the viewpoint transformer to be in window space. A scale may be applied multiplying by the width of the window as well as a bias adding to the offset from the screen origin . At this point the vertices have coordinates which directly relate to pixels in a raster. Graphics pipeline may include a rasterization module. Rasterization is a process performed by the rasterization module by which a 2D image space representation of a scene is converted into raster format and the correct resulting pixel values are determined. From this point on operations may be carried out on single pixels. Graphics pipeline may include a texture mapping unit. At this stage of graphics pipeline individual fragments or pre pixels are assigned a color based on values interpolated from the vertices during rasterization or from a texture in memory. Graphics data associated with these final colored pixels may be provided from graphics pipeline e.g. as 3D graphical data or 2D graphical data to display driver to be displayed on screen in a defined region.

In alternative embodiments graphics pipeline may have other configurations as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein.

In an embodiment API may be configured to transform one type of content received from an application to another type of content. For instance such a translation may be performed if the display screen does not support a particular type of content display if a user has selected or indicated a preference for a type of content etc. In the examples of A and B described above it is assumed that the display device supports the display of both two dimensional and three dimensional content. However it is noted that not all types of display device e.g. display device may support both two dimensional content and three dimensional content. Furthermore not all types of display device that support three dimensional content may support all types of three dimensional content. As such in embodiments API may be configured to translate unsupported types of content to supported types of content.

For instance shows a block diagram of programming library of API of according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in programming library includes a first translator and a second translator . In embodiments programming library may include one or both of first and second translators and . First and second translators and may be programming sequences that may be called to translate content from one type to another type. First translator may called when a display device does not support the display of three dimensional content. Second translator may be called when a display device does not support the display of one or more types of three dimensional content.

First translator is configured to translate received 3D data to 2D data for display by a display device. For example API may receive an indication of a 2D configuration of a screen region. As such if received content for display in the screen region is 3D content first translator may translate three dimensional graphical data representative of the received content to two dimensional graphical data . The supported type of two dimensional graphical data may be transmitted to the display device to enable the corresponding two dimensional content to be displayed in the region of screen .

Furthermore a display device that supports the display of three dimensional data may not support all types of three dimensional data e.g. the display device does not support 3D graphics data having additional camera views other than initial first right and left views does not support a number of camera views greater than 3D 4 etc. . Second translator is configured to translate received 3D data of a first 3D content type to 3D data of a second 3D content type for display by a display device. For example API may receive an indication of a 3D configuration of a screen region. As such if received content for display in the screen region is a type of 3D content that is unsupported by the screen region second translator may translate the unsupported type of three dimensional graphical data of the received content to a supported type of three dimensional graphical data . The supported type of three dimensional graphical data may be transmitted to the display device to enable the corresponding three dimensional content to be displayed in the region of screen .

First translator may be configured in various ways to translate received 3D data to 2D data. For instance in an embodiment three dimensional graphical data may be received as a stream of right image data and left image data. First translator may be configured to combine the right and left image data into two dimensional image data that defines a stream of two dimensional images that may be output as two dimensional graphical data . In another embodiment first translator may be configured to select the right image data or the left image data to be output as two dimensional graphical data while the other of the right image data or left image data is not used. In further embodiments first translator may translate received 3D data to 2D data in other ways.

Second translator may be configured in various ways to translate 3D data of a first 3D content type to 3D data of a second 3D content type. For instance second translator may translate a first 3D multiview type e.g. 3D 16 to a second 3D multiview type e.g. 3D 4 or to a single 3D view. In such an embodiment second translator may not pass extra left right image pairs from first type three dimensional graphical data to second type three dimensional graphical data . In an embodiment second translator and or first translator may use techniques of image scaling to modify an unsupported display resolution to a supported display resolution. For instance second translator may use upsampling or interpolating to increase resolution and may use subsampling or downsampling to decrease resolution. In further embodiments second translator may translate 3D data in other ways. In still further embodiments a translator may be present to translate 2D content to 3D content such as when a user has a preference to view content as 3D content. Various techniques may be used to convert 2D graphical data to 3D graphical data as would be known to person skilled in the relevant art s .

In an embodiment a user interface may be provided that allows a user to associate parameters with a displayed screen region by issuing commands in accordance with an API. For instance as described above user input interface receives user input to enable persons to interact with display devices associated with display system . For example via user input interface a user may be enabled to move displayed graphical objects e.g. icons windows etc. may be able to modify e.g. rotate resize etc. displayed graphical objects to interact with displayed controls etc. User input interface may provide a command line interface a GUI and or other interface with which the user can interact. In embodiments user input interface may enable users to adjust three dimensional characteristics of displayed three dimensional content. For example user input interface may enable three dimensionality of displayed content to be turned on or off e.g. to toggle between two dimensionality and three dimensionality . User input interface may enable a degree of three dimensionality of displayed content to be modified e.g. increased or decreased such as by changing a depth of three dimensionality increasing or decreasing a number of supplied camera views etc. may enable three dimensional objects to be rotated in three dimensions and or may enable further types of adjustment to three dimensional characteristics of displayed three dimensional content. Furthermore user input interface may enable other characteristics of displayed content to be modified such as modifying contrast brightness etc.

In embodiments the user may interact with user input interface in various ways including using a mouse pointing device to move a displayed pointer cursor. The pointer may be used to click and drag objects to move them to resize objects to rotate objects to select controls settings to open a pop up menu etc. In other embodiments the user may interact with a keyboard a thumb wheel or other wheel a roller ball a stick pointer a touch sensitive display any number of virtual interface elements e.g. such as a keyboard or other user interface element displayed by screen a voice recognition system and or other user interface elements described elsewhere herein or otherwise known to provide user input. For instance user input interface may support a touch screen that is reactive to user finger touches to the screen to cause three dimensional characteristics of displayed objects to be modified. For instance particular motions of one or more figures against the screen may cause object resizing 3D rotation movement in 3D etc. e.g. touching two fingers to the screen and dragging them together may be interpreted as grabbing a window and moving the window in 3D .

As a result of the input signal received at the user input interface API may generate a configuration request that is configured to cause an adjustment of a three dimensional characteristic of three dimensional content displayed in the corresponding region of screen . The configuration request may be received by a display driver such as one of driver variants and of or display driver of which may generate a control signal based on the command. The control signal may relate to selecting and or modifying a three dimensional characteristic indicated by a user interacting with user input interface . The control signal may be delivered by the display driver to the display device to cause an adjustment of the three dimensional characteristic of three dimensional content displayed in a region of screen e.g. by causing a device driver circuit to generate corresponding drive signals .

For example a user may interact with one of regions or shown in A and B. The user may resize a region and or object that is displayed as three dimensional may rotate a region and or object that is displayed as three dimensional may move a region and or object that is displayed as three dimensional in any of the three degrees e.g. left right up down or forward backward from a first screen region to a second screen region may change a degree of three dimensionality of a region and or object that is displayed as three dimensional e.g. reducing or increasing a number of associated camera views etc. A corresponding configuration request and thereby a control signal may be generated to adjust the three dimensional characteristic of the three dimensional content being displayed.

In an embodiment an API may include an API description document that defines a plurality of calling conventions of the API. For instance shows a block diagram of API according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in API includes an API description document . API description document defines a plurality of calling conventions for API . API description document may be a human readable document stored in electronic form e.g. as a file in storage including any type of storage described elsewhere herein.

Any type and number of calling conventions may be defined in API description document according to the particular implementation. For instance the plurality of calling conventions defined by API description document may include a first calling convention for a request to configure a screen region to display three dimensional content and a second calling convention for a request to configure a screen region to display two dimensional content. Further types of calling conventions may be defined by API description document . For instance the first command of step may be configured according to the first calling convention and the second command of step may be configured according to the second calling conventions. Further types of calling conventions may be defined in API description document to call further functions of API as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein.

Embodiments described herein for APIs that support the display of two dimensional and three dimensional content may be implemented with respect to various types of display devices. For example as described above some display screens are configured for displaying two dimensional content although they may display two dimensional images that may be combined to form three dimensional images by special glasses worn by users. Some other types of display screens are capable of display two dimensional content and three dimensional content without the users having to wear special glasses using techniques of autostereoscopy. As described above API embodiments described herein may generate configuration requests in response to application calls to configure regions of the display screen for display of content and may provide the content for display in the configured regions. Display drivers e.g. display driver of driver variants and of display driver of etc. may receive the configuration requests commands and may generate control signals to cause the screen to be configured as indicated. Furthermore the display drivers may supply the content provided by the applications through the APIs to the display devices to be displayed on the screen. Example display devices screens and display driver circuits are described as follows that receive the control signals are configured accordingly and that receive and display the provided content.

As described above display devices such as display device e.g. display devices may be implemented in various ways. For instance display device may be a television display e.g. an LCD liquid crystal display television a plasma television etc. a computer monitor or any other type of display device. Display device may include any suitable type or combination of light and image generating devices including an LCD screen a plasma screen an LED light emitting device screen e.g. an OLED organic LED screen etc. Furthermore display device may include any suitable type of light filtering device such as a parallax barrier e.g. an LCD filter a mechanical filter e.g. that incorporates individually controllable shutters etc. and or a lenticular lens and may be configured in any manner including as a thin film device e.g. formed of a stack of thin film layers etc. Furthermore display device may include any suitable light emitting device as backlighting including a panel of LEDs or other light emitting elements.

As shown in screen includes a light manipulator . Light manipulator is configured to manipulate light that passes through light manipulator to enable three dimensional images to be delivered to users in a viewing space. For instance control signal s may be configured to activate or deactivate light manipulator to place screen in a three dimensional display mode or a two dimensional display mode respectively.

Examples of light manipulator include a parallax barrier and a lenticular lens. For instance light manipulator may be a parallax barrier that has a layer of material with a series of precision slits. The parallax barrier is placed proximal to a light emitting pixel array so that a user s eyes each see a different set of pixels to create a sense of depth through parallax. In another embodiment light manipulator may be a lenticular lens that includes an array of magnifying lenses configured so that when viewed from slightly different angles different images are magnified.

Exemplary embodiments for display devices and of are described as follows for purposes of illustration.

Display devices and may include parallax barriers as light manipulators and respectively. For instance shows a block diagram of a display system which is an example of display device according to an embodiment. As shown in system includes a display device driver circuit an image generator and parallax barrier . As shown in image generator includes a pixel array and parallax barrier includes a barrier element array . Furthermore as shown in display driver circuit includes a pixel array driver circuit and a barrier array driver circuit . These features of system are described as follows.

Pixel array includes a two dimensional array of pixels e.g. arranged in a grid or other distribution . Pixel array is a self illuminating or light generating pixel array such that the pixels of pixel array each emit light included in light emitted from image generator . Each pixel may be a separately addressable light source e.g. a pixel of a plasma display an LCD display an LED display such as an OLED display or of other type of display . Each pixel of pixel array may be individually controllable to vary color and intensity. In an embodiment each pixel of pixel array may include a plurality of sub pixels that correspond to separate color channels such as a trio of red green and blue sub pixels included in each pixel.

Parallax barrier is positioned proximate to a surface of pixel array . Barrier element array is a layer of parallax barrier that includes a plurality of barrier elements or blocking regions arranged in an array. Each barrier element of the array is configured to be selectively opaque or transparent. Combinations of barrier elements may be configured to be selectively opaque or transparent to enable various effects. For example in one embodiment each barrier element may have a round square or rectangular shape and barrier element array may have any number of rows of barrier elements that extend a vertical length of barrier element array . In another embodiment each barrier element may have a band shape that extends a vertical length of barrier element array such that barrier element array includes a single horizontal row of barrier elements. Each barrier element may include one or more of such bands and different regions of barrier element array may include barrier elements that include different numbers of such bands.

One advantage of such a configuration where barrier elements extend a vertical length of barrier element array is that such barrier elements do not need to have spacing between them because there is no need for drive signal routing in such space. For instance in a two dimensional LCD array configuration such as TFT thin film transistor display a transistor plus capacitor circuit is typically placed onsite at the corner of a single pixel in the array and drive signals for such transistors are routed between the LCD pixels row column control for example . In a pixel configuration for a parallax barrier local transistor control may not be necessary because barrier elements may not need to be changing as rapidly as display pixels e.g. pixels of pixel array . For a single row of vertical bands of barrier elements drive signals may be routed to the top and or bottom of barrier elements. Because in such a configuration drive signal routing between rows is not needed the vertical bands can be arranged side by side with little to no space in between. Thus if the vertical bands are thin and oriented edge to edge one band or multiple adjacent bands e.g. five bands may comprise a barrier element in a blocking state followed by one band or multiple adjacent bands e.g. two bands that comprise a barrier element in a non blocking state a slit and so on. In the example of five bands in a blocking state and two bands in a non blocking state the five bands may combine to offer a single black barrier element of approximately 2.5 times the width of a single transparent slit with no spaces therein.

It is noted that in some embodiments barrier elements may be capable of being completely transparent or opaque and in other embodiments barrier elements may not be capable of being fully transparent or opaque. For instance such barrier elements may be capable of being 95 transparent when considered to be transparent and may be capable of being 5 transparent when considered to be opaque. Transparent and opaque as used herein are intended to encompass barrier elements being substantially transparent e.g. greater than 75 transparent including completely transparent and substantially opaque e.g. less than 25 transparent including completely opaque respectively.

Display driver circuit receives control signal and content signal . As described below content signal includes two dimensional and or three dimensional content for display. Control signal may be control signal of for a non adaptable parallax barrier or may be control signal of for an adaptable parallax barrier .

Display driver circuit is configured to generate drive signals based on control signal and content signal to enable display system to display two dimensional and three dimensional images to users in viewing space . For example pixel array driver circuit is configured to generate a drive signal that is received by pixel array e.g. based on content signal and or control signal . Drive signal may include one or more drive signals used to cause pixels of pixel array to emit light of particular desired colors and or intensity. Barrier array driver circuit is configured to generate a drive signal that is received by barrier element array e.g. based on control signal . Drive signal may include one or more drive signals used to cause each of the barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent or opaque. In this manner barrier element array filters light to generate filtered light that includes one or more two dimensional and or three dimensional images that may be viewed by users in viewing space .

For example drive signal may control sets of pixels of pixel array to each emit light representative of a respective image to provide a plurality of images. Drive signal may control barrier elements of barrier element array to filter the light received from pixel array according to the provided images such that one or more of the images are received by users in two dimensional form. For instance drive signal may select one or more sets of barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent to transmit one or more corresponding two dimensional images or views to users . Furthermore drive signal may control sections of barrier element array to include opaque and transparent barrier elements to filter the light received from pixel array so that one or more pairs of images or views provided by pixel array are each received by users as a corresponding three dimensional image or view. For example drive signal may select parallel strips of barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent to form slits that enable three dimensional images to be received by users .

In embodiments drive signal may be generated by barrier array driver circuit to configure one or more characteristics of barrier element array . For example drive signal may be generated to form any number of parallel strips of barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent to modify the number and or spacing of parallel strips of barrier elements of barrier element array that are transparent to select and or modify a width and or a length in barrier elements of one or more strips of barrier elements of barrier element array that are transparent or opaque to select and or modify an orientation of one or more strips of barrier elements of barrier element array that are transparent to select one or more areas of barrier element array to include all transparent or all opaque barrier elements etc.

Backlighting is a backlight panel that emits light . Light element array or backlight array of backlighting includes a two dimensional array of light sources. Such light sources may be arranged for example in a rectangular grid. Each light source in light element array is individually addressable and controllable to select an amount of light emitted thereby.

Filtered light is configured to enable a two dimensional image or a three dimensional image e.g. formed by a pair of two dimensional images in filtered light to be formed based on images subsequently imposed on filtered light by pixel array .

Similarly to pixel array of pixel array of includes a two dimensional array of pixels e.g. arranged in a grid or other distribution . However pixel array is not self illuminating and instead is a light filter that imposes images e.g. in the form of color grayscale etc. on filtered light from parallax barrier to generate filtered light to include one or more images. Each pixel of pixel array may be a separately addressable filter e.g. a pixel of a plasma display an LCD display an LED display or of other type of display . Each pixel of pixel array may be individually controllable to vary the color imposed on the corresponding light passing through and or to vary the intensity of the passed light in filtered light . In an embodiment each pixel of pixel array may include a plurality of sub pixels that correspond to separate color channels such as a trio of red green and blue sub pixels included in each pixel.

Display driver circuit of is configured to generate drive signals based on control signal and or content signal to enable display system to display two dimensional and three dimensional images to users in viewing space . For example light source driver circuit within display driver circuit controls the amount of light emitted by each light source in light element array by generating a drive signal that is received by light element array based on content signal and or control signal . Drive signal may include one or more drive signals used to control the amount of light emitted by each light source in light element array to generate light . As described above barrier array driver circuit is configured to generate drive signal received by barrier element array e.g. based on control signal . Drive signal may include one or more drive signals used to cause each of the barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent or opaque to filter light to generate filtered light . Pixel array driver circuit is configured to generate a drive signal that is received by pixel array e.g. based on content signal and or control signal . Drive signal may include one or more drive signals used to cause pixels of pixel array to impose desired images e.g. colors grayscale etc. on filtered light as it passes through pixel array . In this manner pixel array generates filtered light that includes one or more two dimensional and or three dimensional images that may be viewed by users in viewing space .

For example drive signal may control sets of light sources of light element array to emit light . Drive signal may control barrier elements of barrier element array to filter light received from light element array to enable filtered light to enable two and or three dimensionality. Drive signal may control sets of pixels of pixel array to filter filtered light according to respective images to provide a plurality of images. For instance drive signal may select one or more sets of the barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent to enable one or more corresponding two dimensional images to be delivered to users . Furthermore drive signal may control sections of barrier element array to include opaque and transparent barrier elements to filter the light received from light element array so that one or more pairs of images provided by pixel array are each enabled to be received by users as a corresponding three dimensional image. For example drive signal may select parallel strips of barrier elements of barrier element array to be transparent to form slits that enable three dimensional images to be received by users .

Flowchart begins with step . In step light is received at an array of barrier elements. For example as shown in light is received at parallax barrier from pixel array . Each pixel of pixel array may generate light that is received at parallax barrier . Depending on the particular display mode of parallax barrier parallax barrier may filter light from pixel array to generate a two dimensional image or a three dimensional image viewable in viewing space by users . As described above with respect to alternatively light may be received by parallax barrier from light element array .

In step a first set of the barrier elements of the array of barrier elements is configured in the blocking state and a second set of the barrier elements of the array of barrier elements is configured in the non blocking state to enable a viewer to be delivered a three dimensional view. Three dimensional image content may be provided for viewing in viewing space . In such case referring to or barrier array driver circuit may generate drive signal to configure barrier element array to include transparent strips of barrier elements to enable a three dimensional view to be formed. For example as shown in barrier element array includes a plurality of barrier elements that are each either transparent in a non blocking state or opaque in a blocking state . Barrier elements that are blocking are indicated as barrier elements and barrier elements that are non blocking are indicated as barrier elements . Further barrier elements may be included in barrier element array that are not visible in . Each of barrier elements and may include one or more barrier elements. Barrier elements alternate with barrier elements in series in the order of barrier elements and . In this manner blocking barrier elements are alternated with non blocking barrier elements to form a plurality of parallel non blocking or transparent slits in barrier element array .

For instance shows a view of a parallax barrier with transparent slits according to an exemplary embodiment. Parallax barrier is an example of parallax barrier of . As shown in parallax barrier includes barrier element array which includes a plurality of barrier elements arranged in a two dimensional array. Furthermore as shown in barrier element array includes a plurality of parallel strips of barrier elements that are selected to be non blocking to form a plurality of parallel non blocking strips or slits . As shown in parallel non blocking strips non blocking slits are alternated with parallel blocking or blocking strips of barrier elements that are selected to be blocking. In the example of non blocking strips and blocking strips each have a width along the x dimension of two barrier elements and have lengths that extend along the entire y dimension twenty barrier elements of barrier element array although in other embodiments may have alternative dimensions. Non blocking strips and blocking strips form a parallax barrier configuration for parallax barrier . The spacing and number of parallel non blocking strips in barrier element array may be selectable by choosing any number and combination of particular strips of barrier elements in barrier element array to be non blocking to be alternated with blocking strips as desired. For example hundreds thousands or even larger numbers of non blocking strips and blocking strips may be present in parallax barrier .

Referring back to in step the light is filtered at the array of barrier elements to form the three dimensional view in a viewing space. Barrier element array of parallax barrier is configured to filter light received from pixel array or light received from light element array according to whether barrier element array is transparent or non blocking e.g. in a two dimensional mode or includes parallel non blocking strips e.g. in a three dimensional mode . If one or more regions of barrier element array are transparent those regions of barrier element array function as all pass filters to substantially pass all of light as filtered light to deliver one or more corresponding two dimensional images generated by pixel array to viewing space to be viewable as a two dimensional images in a similar fashion as a conventional display. If barrier element array includes one or more regions having parallel non blocking strips e.g. as shown for barrier element array in those regions of barrier element array pass a portion of light as filtered light to deliver one or more corresponding three dimensional images to viewing space .

For example as shown in pixel array includes a plurality of pixels and . Pixels alternate with pixels such that pixels and are arranged in series in the order of pixels and . Further pixels may be included in pixel array that are not visible in including further pixels along the width dimension of pixel array e.g. in the left right directions as well as pixels along a length dimension of pixel array not visible in . Each of pixels and generates light which emanates from display surface of pixel array e.g. generally upward in towards barrier element array . Some example indications of light emanating from pixels and are shown in as dotted lines including light and light emanating from pixel light light and light emanating from pixel etc.

Furthermore light emanating from pixel array is filtered by barrier element array to form a plurality of images in a viewing space including a first image at a first location and a second image at a second location . A portion of the light emanating from pixel array is blocked by blocking barrier elements while another portion of the light emanating from pixel array passes through non blocking barrier elements according to the filtering by barrier element array . For instance light from pixel is blocked by blocking barrier element and light and light from pixel are blocked by blocking barrier elements and respectively. In contrast light from pixel is passed by non blocking barrier element and light from pixel is passed by non blocking barrier element

By forming parallel non blocking slits in a barrier element array light from a pixel array can be filtered to form multiple images or views in a viewing space. For instance system shown in is configured to form first and second images and at locations and respectively which are positioned at a distance from pixel array as shown in further instances of first and second images and may be formed in viewing space according to system in a repeating alternating fashion . As described above pixel array includes a first set of pixels and a second set of pixels . Pixels correspond to first image and pixels correspond to second image . Due to the spacing of pixels and in pixel array and the geometry of non blocking barrier elements in barrier element array first and second images and are formed at locations and respectively. As shown in light from the first set of pixels is focused at location to form first image at location . Light from the second set of pixels is focused at location to form second image at location

First and second images and are configured to be perceived by a user as a three dimensional image or view. For example a viewer may receive first image at a first eye location and second image at a second eye location according to an exemplary embodiment. First and second images and may be generated by first set of pixels and second set of pixels as images that are slightly different perspective from each other. Images and are combined in the visual center of the brain of the viewer to be perceived as a three dimensional image or view. In such an embodiment first and second images and may be formed by display system such that their centers are spaced apart a width of a user s pupils e.g. an interocular distance .

Note that in the embodiments of the entire regions of parallax barriers and are filled with parallel non blocking strips e.g. as shown for barrier element array in to be configured to deliver three dimensional images to viewing space . In further embodiments one or more regions of a parallax barrier may be filled with parallel non blocking strips to deliver three dimensional images and one or more other regions of the parallax barrier may be transparent to deliver two dimensional images. Furthermore different regions of a parallax barrier that have parallel non blocking strips may have the parallel non blocking strips oriented at different angles to deliver three dimensional images to viewers that are oriented differently.

For instance shows a view of a parallax barrier configured to enable the simultaneous display of two dimensional and three dimensional images at different regions according to exemplary embodiments. Parallax barrier is similar to parallax barrier of having barrier element array including a plurality of barrier elements arranged in a two dimensional array. In a first region of barrier element array includes a plurality of parallel non blocking strips alternated with parallel blocking strips that together fill first region . A second region of barrier element array is surrounded by first region . Second region is a rectangular shaped region of barrier element array that includes a two dimensional array of barrier elements that are non blocking. Thus in barrier element array is configured to enable a three dimensional image to be generated by pixels of a pixel array that are adjacent to barrier elements of first region and to enable a two dimensional image to be generated by pixels of the pixel array that are adjacent to barrier elements inside of second region . Note that alternatively first region may include all non blocking barrier elements to pass a two dimensional image and second region may include parallel non blocking strips alternated with parallel blocking strips to pass a three dimensional image. In further embodiments parallax barrier may have additional numbers sizes and arrangements of regions configured to pass different combinations of two dimensional images and three dimensional images.

In another example shows a view of a parallax barrier with transparent slits having different orientations according to an exemplary embodiment. Parallax barrier is similar to parallax barrier of having barrier element array including a plurality of barrier elements arranged in a two dimensional array. A first region e.g. a bottom half of barrier element array includes a first plurality of parallel strips of barrier elements that are selected to be non blocking to form a first plurality of parallel non blocking strips each having a width of two barrier elements . As shown in parallel non blocking strips are alternated with parallel blocking strips of barrier elements each having a width of three barrier elements . Parallel non blocking strips are oriented in a first direction e.g. along a vertical axis .

Furthermore as shown in a second region e.g. a top half of barrier element array includes a second plurality of parallel strips of barrier elements that are selected to be non blocking to form a second plurality of parallel non blocking strips each having a width of one barrier element . As shown in parallel non blocking strips are alternated with parallel blocking strips of barrier elements each having a width of two barrier elements . Parallel non blocking strips are oriented in a second direction e.g. along a horizontal axis .

As such in first and second pluralities of parallel non blocking strips and are present in barrier element array that are oriented perpendicularly to each other. The region of barrier element array that includes first plurality of parallel non blocking strips may be configured to deliver a three dimensional image in a viewing space as described above to be viewable by a user whose body is oriented vertically e.g. sitting upright or standing up . The region of barrier element array that includes second plurality of parallel non blocking strips may be configured to deliver a three dimensional image in a viewing space as described above to be viewable by a user whose body is oriented horizontally e.g. laying down . In this manner users who are oriented differently relative to each other can still each be provided with a corresponding three dimensional image that accommodates their position.

As described above in an embodiment display device of may be configured to generate a two dimensional image for viewing by users in a viewing space. For instance referring to barrier element array may be configured into a third configuration to deliver a two dimensional view. In the third configuration barrier array driver circuit may generate drive signal to configure each barrier element of barrier element array to be in the non blocking state transparent . If barrier element array is non blocking barrier element array functions as an all pass filter to substantially pass all of light or light as filtered light to deliver the two dimensional image to viewing space to be viewable as a two dimensional image in a similar fashion as a conventional display.

In embodiments display systems may be configured to generate multiple two dimensional images or views for viewing by users in a viewing space. For example FIG. shows a display system configured to deliver two two dimensional images according to an embodiment. Display system is configured similarly to display system of . As shown in display system includes pixel array and barrier element array which generate first and second images and . As shown in a first viewer receives first image at a first location and a second viewer receives second image at a second location according to an exemplary embodiment. Similarly to the description provided above with respect to first and second images and may be generated by first set of pixels and second set of pixels of pixel array . However rather than first and second images and being images that are of different perspective first and second images and are each a two dimensional image that may be viewed independently from each other. For instance image and image may generated by display system from first media content and second media content respectively that are independent of each other. Image may be received by both eyes of first viewer to be perceived by first viewer as a first two dimensional image and image may be received by both eyes of second viewer to be perceived by second viewer as a second two dimensional image. Thus first and second images and may be generated to have a spacing that enables them to be separately viewed by first and second users and

As such display system of can be configured to deliver a single three dimensional view to a viewer e.g. as shown in for display system to deliver a pair of two dimensional views to a pair of viewers e.g. as shown in or to deliver a pair of three dimensional views to a pair of viewers as described above . Display system can be configured to switch between delivering views to one and two viewers by turning off or turning on respectively the display of media content by pixel array associated with one of the viewers e.g. by turning off or on pixels associated with second image . Display system can be configured to switch between delivering two dimensional and three dimensional views by providing the corresponding media content type at pixel array . Furthermore display system may provide such capabilities when configured similarly to display system shown in e.g. including backlighting .

In an embodiment display system may be configured to generate multiple three dimensional images that include related image content e.g. each three dimensional image is a different viewpoint of a common scene or that each include unrelated image content for viewing by users in a viewing space. Each of the three dimensional images may correspond to a pair of images generated by pixels of the pixel array. The barrier element array filters light from the pixel array to form the image pairs in a viewing space to be perceived by users as three dimensional images.

For instance shows a flowchart for generating multiple three dimensional images according to an exemplary embodiment. Flowchart is described with respect to which shows a cross sectional view of a display system . Display system is an exemplary embodiment of system shown in and is shown for purposes of illustration.

Further structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s based on the discussion regarding flowchart . Flowchart is described as follows.

Flowchart begins with step . In step light is received from an array of pixels that includes a plurality of pairs of sets of pixels. For instance in the example of pixel array includes a first set of pixels a second set of pixels a third set of pixels and a fourth set of pixels . Each of pixels generates light which emanates from the surface of pixel array towards barrier element array . Each set of pixels generates a corresponding image. First set of pixels and third set of pixels are configured to generate images that combine to form a first three dimensional image. Second set of pixels and fourth set of pixels are configured to generate images that combine to form a second three dimensional image. Pixels of the four sets of pixels are alternated in pixel array in the order of pixel pixel pixel pixel pixel pixel etc. Further pixels may be included in each set of pixels in pixel array that are not visible in including hundreds thousands or millions of pixels in each set of pixels.

As described above in the current embodiment pixel array is segmented into a plurality of pairs of sets of pixels. For instance in the example of pixel array is segmented into four sets of pixels. The first set of pixels includes pixels and the other pixels in the same columns the second set of pixels includes pixels and the other pixels in the same columns pixels and the other pixels in the same columns and pixels and the other pixels in the same columns.

In step a plurality of strips of barrier elements of a barrier element array is selected to be non blocking to form a plurality of parallel non blocking slits. As shown in barrier element array includes barrier elements that are each either non blocking or blocking. Barrier elements that are blocking are indicated as barrier elements and barrier elements that are non blocking are indicated as barrier elements . Further barrier elements may be included in barrier element array that are not visible in including hundreds thousands or millions of barrier elements etc. Each of barrier elements and may include one or more barrier elements. Barrier elements alternate with barrier elements . In this manner blocking barrier elements are alternated with non blocking barrier elements to form a plurality of parallel non blocking slits in barrier element array .

In step the light is filtered at the barrier element array to form a plurality of pairs of images in a viewing space corresponding to the plurality of pairs of sets of pixels each pair of images of the plurality of pairs of images being configured to be perceived as a corresponding three dimensional image of a plurality of three dimensional images. As shown in light emanating from pixel array is filtered by barrier element array to form a plurality of images in a viewing space . For instance four images are formed in viewing space including first fourth images . Pixels correspond to first image pixels correspond to second image pixels correspond to third image and pixels correspond to fourth image . As shown in light from the first set of pixels forms first image and light from the third set of pixels forms third image due to the filtering of the non blocking slits corresponding to non blocking barrier elements in barrier element array . Although not indicated in for ease of illustration in a similar fashion light from the second set of pixels forms second image and light from the fourth set of pixels forms fourth image

In the embodiment of any pair of images of images may be configured to be perceived as a three dimensional image by a user in viewing space . For instance first and third images and may be configured to be perceived by a user as a first three dimensional image such that first image is received at a first eye location and third image is received at a second eye location of a user. Furthermore second and fourth images and may be configured to be perceived by a user as a second three dimensional image such that second image is received at a first eye location and fourth image is received at a second eye location of a user.

In the example of two three dimensional images are provided by system . In further embodiments further numbers of three dimensional images may be provided including a third three dimensional image a fourth three dimensional image etc. In such case each three dimensional image is generated by filtering light using a barrier element array corresponding to an image pair generated by a corresponding pair of sets of pixels of the pixel array in a similar fashion as described with respect to for two three dimensional images. For example to provide three three dimensional images pixel array may include fifth and sixth sets of pixels that generate fifth and sixth images respectively to be perceived by a user as a third three dimensional image. To provide a fourth three dimensional image pixel array may include seventh and eighth sets of pixels that generate seventh and eighth images respectively to be perceived by a user as the fourth three dimensional image.

In the first and second three dimensional images generated based on first and third images and and second and fourth images and respectively and any further three dimensional images that may be generated may include related image content or may each include unrelated image content. For example in an embodiment the first and second three dimensional images and any further three dimensional images may have been captured as different viewpoints of a common scene. Thus a user in viewing space that moves laterally to sequentially view the first and second three dimensional images and any further three dimensional images may perceive being able to partially or fully view behind objects of the common scene.
