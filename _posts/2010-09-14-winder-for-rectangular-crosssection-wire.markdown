The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to wire winding devices. In particular the invention provides an apparatus for winding wire having a square or rectangular cross section.

Efforts to incorporate instrumentation in gun launched projectiles are adversely affected by damage to sensitive electronics from propellant induced sudden acceleration. To mitigate this condition development has been initiated of launchers having more gradual acceleration by using electromagnetic induction motors such as for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 444 919 under Navy Case 97941 . To maximize magnetic field density coated copper wire that incorporates rectangular cross sections have been investigated to flow electric current there through to induce the Lorentz force motive fields.

Conventional wire winding apparatuses yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular conventional wire winding devices are limited to round wire due to twist from spooling torsion. Various exemplary embodiments provide a device for winding wire into a coil. The device includes a shaft for turning on an axis a hub attached to the shaft inner and outer wheels a mandrel having an outer radial surface for looping the wire and a guide connectable to the mandrel and extending past the inner wheel. The shaft is structurally supported by a housing.

The inner wheel mandrel and outer wheel are removably fastened to the hub the wire passes along the guide and lays along the radial surface of the mandrel and the shaft rotates for looping the wire around the mandrel. The shaft can be rotated either manually or by a motor. Other various embodiments provide a system that includes the winding device and further includes a wire feed device particularly for arranging several strands of wire into a ribbon.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Winding wire around a cylindrical mandrel induces twist as the wire is wound in circular or helical fashion. Typical wire having a circular cross section readily conforms to such twisting as such configurations maintain symmetry irrespective of angular orientation. By contrast rectangular or square cross section wire possesses quadrilateral symmetry rather than axial symmetry.

Thus such twisting disturbs uninterrupted layup of wire having rectangular cross section thereby inducing voids and non homogeneous distribution of the conductive material. To mitigate this condition various exemplary embodiments provide a wire winder system that addresses the peculiarities of winding rectangular cross section wire.

Several wire strands from multiple feed spools can be concatenated together in a linearly disposed ribbon. In the configuration shown the in feed spool includes six grooves to lead the wires along the direction towards the out feed spool with a single wide groove for submitting the ribbon to the winding device .

Additional components associated with the mandrel include a wire finish clamp base a wire finish clamp and an in feed wire guide . Screws or alternate fasteners may be used to secure the wire guide to the mandrel for looping the wire.

Upon completion of the winding process screws may be used to secure the base to the mandrel and then screws may be used to secure the clamp to the base for maintaining the wire arrangement on the mandrel . Alternatively other types of fasteners may be used to secure the base and the clamp . An inner pinwheel is disposed behind the mandrel which can be identical in size and shape to the outer pinwheel . The pinwheels and are shown as interchangeable components in the system view labeled by pinwheel . A plate attachment hub is disposed behind the inner pinwheel .

The mandrel pinwheels and and the hub rotate along a main drive shaft suspended on a first axle bearing . The shaft can optionally be turned by a crank wheel . The example illustrated represents a configuration for hand power but artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that alternate modes for providing necessary torque can be availed without exceeding the scope of the invention.

The crank wheel resides within a frame that includes fore and aft torsion plates and separated by port and starboard support plates and . Suspending from a second bearing the shaft extends beyond the aft plate to an overrun friction clutch to prevent backlash and coupled to a reduction coupler . A clutch torsion bracket provides an attachment to the aft plate for a worm gear that connects to the shaft and is powered by a drive motor .

The worm gear enables rotation in one direction to maintain tension in the wire during winding. The drive motor provides motive torque for turning the shaft as an automatically driven alternative to manually operating the crank wheel . Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that either the crank wheel or the gear with motor or else both mechanisms can be employed for the winder without departing from the spirit of the invention.

Each of the pinwheels and include radial slots through which wire can be guided and pass through. In the example shown each pinwheel and includes eight slots angularly separated by forty five degrees 45 or 4 radians. Those of ordinary skill will recognize that the number of slots can be altered to facilitate application of liquid adhesive along each layer of wire. Furthermore although single quantities of the base clamp and guide are illustrated additional sets of these items can be provided for separate mandrels with which to spool additional wire. Moreover any slot may be used in this process without departing from the spirit of the invention.

Wire from the source spool passes through the feed device to the hub for a few turns. An operator directs the wire over the wire guide attached to the mandrel and passing through the inner pinwheel at one of the slots . The wire passes through that slot to lay along the outer radial surface of the mandrel . For a single strand the wire can wind to lay adjacent a previously wound loop on the mandrel . For multiple strands the wires can wind to lay flat upon the mandrel as a ribbon.

Upon completion of a layer of wire loops the operator can apply adhesive to the wires to sure their arrangement after winding is complete. This process may be repeated until the final layer has been laid on the mandrel . After completion of laying wire on the mandrel the base and clamp may be secured to the mandrel to prevent axial slippage of the wire. Subsequently the subassembly may be disassembled and the mandrel removed for the adhesive to cure. After the adhesive has hardened the wire coil may be removed from the mandrel for its destined application and the mandrel reused for an additional coil.

Conventional methods of winding these coils employed an unrefined impromptu device without the capability to hold the arranged loop to close tolerance. Also the conventional device had only the capability to wind a single coil per day and lacked tensioning abilities for maintaining the coils of wire tight around its core.

Common methods for making coils in an industrial application include automated machinery. Such conventional machinery typically uses a coated wire with round cross section for making the coils. High current density applications require coils of rectangular cross section wire incompatible with commercially available equipment.

Various exemplary embodiments enable an operator to expeditiously wind several inductive coils in a short period of time while maintaining close geometric tolerances on a consistent basis. In addition various exemplary embodiments enable a rectangular or square wire to be wound into coils. Such cross section creates complexity in the coil fabrication process so the embodied device is capable of manipulating the special wires.

Feed at least one wire into the in feed alignment spool and then through the out feed tensioning spool 

Wrap the wire and apply glue to eight points at the slots around the coil until reaching the number of coil wraps desired 

Attach the outer coil wire fastener to the mandrel and clamp the wire in place while maintaining tension 

Remove the mandrel from the winder and trim the wire off with some length remaining for later wiring operations 

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
