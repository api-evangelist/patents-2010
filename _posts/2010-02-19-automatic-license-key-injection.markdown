Other example embodiments of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.

Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system mobile device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system includes a number of mobile communication devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless network which may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some example embodiments the wireless network may include multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSPDA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further include a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public Internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some example embodiments the network may be realised using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN includes a wireless network which in some example embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other example embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be used . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email communications to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email server and a content server for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization s internal servers and application servers for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications to mobile communication devices .

The wireless connector system also allows the mobile communication devices to access an application delivery server . The application delivery server is configured to deliver applications to the mobile devices upon request by the mobile device . Applications are programs that include instructions for the mobile device which provide a user of the mobile device with tools to accomplish a task. By way of non limiting example the applications may include word processions applications media player applications database applications games etc. The application delivery server may be configured to act as an application store to permit users of the mobile communication devices to purchase applications for delivery to their mobile communication devices through the wireless network .

The wireless connector system may further include a licensing server for generating and or providing licensing information such as a license key to the application delivery server or to the mobile communication device .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some example embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some example embodiments the private encryption key is stored only in the user s mailbox on the messaging server and on the mobile communication device and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices is encrypted by the wireless connector system using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox. The encrypted data when received on the mobile communication devices is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly data sent to the wireless connector system from the mobile communication devices is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data when received on the wireless connector system is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server application servers application delivery server or licensing server . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server content server application servers application delivery server or licensing server to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server application server application delivery server and licensing server .

The network may include a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A mobile communication device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may include one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may include one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may include one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth special interest group or IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or other PAN connection.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system includes one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with other types of networks and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a mobile communication device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile communication device is a two way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device in various example embodiments the device may be a data communication device a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile communication device includes a controller including at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device and a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor interacts with the communication subsystem which performs communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems. In some example embodiments the device may include a touchscreen display which includes a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen with a touch sensitive input surface or overlay connected to an electronic controller . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller act as an input mechanism to provide a touch sensitive input device. The processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller . In other example embodiments the display may not be a touchscreen display. Instead the device may simply include a non touch display and one or more input mechanisms such as for example a depressible scroll wheel.

The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone control keys switch short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile communication device is intended to operate.

The mobile communication device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules include operating system software software applications which include an application store client for requesting and receiving a software application from the application delivery server and for injecting a license key received from the application delivery server into the received application. The application store client permits users of the mobile communication device to connect to the application delivery server and to browse or search for applications available for download to their mobile communication device . The injection of a license key may occur as part of an installation process in which the application is installed to the mobile device . In one example embodiment injecting the license key into the application includes setting one or more properties associated with the application. For example one property associated with the application may be a serial number or license key property. Prior to injecting the license key this property may be set to nil. A license injection module of the mobile communication device may change this property to be equal to the received license key. The received license key may then be deleted from any other locations where it was temporarily stored such as cache memory so that it is only stored in the properties of the application.

A user of the mobile communication device may request an application from the application delivery server by interacting with the application store client on the mobile device for example by using the touchscreen display control keys or other input mechanism. In response to receiving a request to download an application from the user the application store client of the mobile communication device may transmit a download request to the application delivery server and wait for the application delivery server to transmit the specified application to the device . The mobile device receives the application from the application delivery server . In some example embodiments the application may require installation onto the mobile device before it may be used. In such cases the application is installed to the mobile device . The installation may be initiated by any one or a combination of the user of the mobile device the application store client of the mobile device other applications the downloaded application itself or the operating system . That is where installation is required the installation may be automatically performed by an application or module or it may be performed upon request by the user.

The application store client further includes a license injection module for receiving a license key from either the application delivery server or the licensing server and injecting the license key into the received application. The license key may be received before during or after the application is received. In some example embodiments the license key may be packaged with the application by the application delivery server and received at the mobile device when the application is received.

In some example embodiments after the application store client receives the license key it displays the license key on the display permitting a user to make a hard copy of the license key to retain for their records. The application store client may prompt the user to create a hard copy of the license key for their records and may ask the user to press one or more control keys or other input sequence on any available input mechanisms when they have created a copy of the license key. The application store client may wait for the user to press a key or provide another form of input before removing the license key from the display screen.

The application store client may among other things be implemented through stand alone software applications or combined together in one or more of the operating system and applications . In some example embodiments the functions performed by the above identified applications may be realized as a plurality of independent elements rather than a single integrated element and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The software applications may include a range of other applications including for example an address book application a messaging application a calendar application and or a notepad application. In some example embodiments the software applications include an email message application a push content viewing application a voice communication i.e. telephony application a map application and a media player application. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display device according to the application.

In some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile communication device such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some example embodiments the mobile communication device also includes a removable memory module such as a memory card typically including flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device via the memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile communication device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile communication device stores data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments the data includes service data including information required by the mobile communication device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile communication device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory. In some example embodiments the data may include identification data such as a Personal Identification Number PIN identifying either the user or the device . In some example embodiments the PIN is a unique identifier assigned to the mobile communication device during manufacturing of that device . The PIN may be saved in non volatile memory so that the device will retain the PIN even when it is powered off. In some example embodiments the identification data such as the PIN may be transmitted to the application delivery server from the device as part of the purchase download or licensing process associated with the delivery of an application or a license key from the application delivery server to the mobile communication device .

The serial data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system not shown . The serial data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In some example embodiments the mobile communication device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the mobile communication device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The mobile communication device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .

The mobile communication device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an application a license key an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the touch sensitive overlay in conjunction with the display device and possibly the control buttons and or the auxiliary I O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile communication device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display device may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Referring now to an application delivery server for use in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described in greater detail. The application delivery server may be implemented using any known general purpose computer technology and may for example be realized as one or more microprocessor based server computers implementing one or more server applications configured for performing the processes and functions described herein.

The application delivery server may include one or more controller such as a processor for controlling the overall operation of the server . The application delivery server may communicate with other devices connected to the network through a communication subsystem and network interface . For example the application delivery server may communicate with the licensing server or the mobile devices via the wireless connector system .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example on a hard disk drive. As illustrated in the software modules include an application store module for interfacing with the application store client on mobile communication devices . The application store module provides information to the mobile communication devices regarding applications available for download and is configured to receive requests from mobile devices to transmit one or more applications to the mobile device and to retrieve and transmit the requested application to the mobile communication device .

The application store module implements the functions of several components and sub modules including for example an application information providing module for retrieving application information from a data store and providing the application information to the mobile communication device . For example the application information providing module may be configured to transmit to the mobile communication device a list of applications which are available to be downloaded to the mobile communication device . The application information providing module may interface with the application store client on the mobile communication device to provide browsing or search functions such as keyword based searching. For example a user of the mobile device may input one or more keywords or other search parameters using the touchscreen or the control keys or other input mechanism of the mobile device. The search parameters may be transmitted to the application delivery server and processed by the application information providing module of the application store to locate applications matching the specified search parameter s . Application information matching the search parameters may then be returned to the mobile communication device . Accordingly the application information providing module of the application delivery server together with the application store client of the mobile communication device may permit a user to search or browse for an appropriate application . Application information received by the mobile device may be displayed to the user on the display .

The application store module of the application delivery server further includes an application delivery module for receiving a request from a mobile device for delivering an application to the mobile device retrieving the application associated with the request from the data store and transmitting the application to the mobile communication device . In some example embodiments the application delivery module may interface with a payment processing module . The payment processing module accepts payment for delivery of an application to the mobile communication device. For example the payment processing module may post a charge to an account associated with the mobile communication device or its user or may process a credit card transaction for the user of the mobile communication device .

The application store module of the application delivery server further includes a licensing module for providing a license key to the mobile communication device . In some example embodiments the license key is a single license key which may always be used by any number of users to license a specific application. In such example embodiments the licensing module may simply retrieve the license key from a local or remote data store and provide it to the mobile communication device over the wireless network or the link . Similarly in other example embodiments a license pool model may be utilized in which the local or remote data store contains a pool of license keys which are handed out one at a time to customers. For example each license key may be used only once.

In other example embodiments a dynamic licensing method may be employed wherein a license key is generated specifically for the mobile communication device and or the user of the mobile communication device . For example a license key may be generated based at least in part on the PIN and or user information such as an account name or email address associated with the user of the mobile communication device . The PIN and user information may be transmitted by and received from the mobile communication device .

In some example embodiments the license key is generated by the licensing module of the application delivery server . In other example embodiments a distributed licensing method is used in which the licensing module of the application delivery server communicates with a licensing server through the network to obtain a license key. The licensing server may be a third party server which is owned by an entity that is distinct from the entity which owns the application delivery server . Accordingly by separating license key generation from application delivery developers are able to create proprietary key generation algorithms.

In order to obtain a license from the licensing server the licensing module may perform an HTTP post to the licensing server which may be a developers website when it is time to generate a new key. The HTTP post may include the information which will be used to generate the key such as the PIN and or user information. The HTTP post may also specify which application the request relates to and a version number associated with that application . In response the licensing server generates and transmits the license key to the licensing module .

Referring still to in example embodiments in which a payment processing module is included in the application delivery server the application delivery module may be configured to only transmit the requested application to the mobile communication device after a payment has been processed and verified. Alternatively in some example embodiments the application delivery module may deliver the application to the mobile communication device before the payment is processed and verified but the license key may not be provided to the mobile communication device by the licensing module until after the payment has been processed and verified.

An overview having been provided reference is now made to which illustrates a method for providing an application to a mobile communication device in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure. The method includes steps or operations performed by the requesting device such as the mobile device and steps or operations which are performed by the application delivery server . The application store module may be configured to perform the server specific steps or operations of the method and the application store client of the mobile device may be configured to perform the device specific steps or operations of the method .

At step the application delivery server may retrieve and transmit application information to the mobile communication device . The application information may include information describing one or more applications . It may include information such as for example a description of the functions provided for by the application a price associated with the application user or critic generated reviews of the application a release date associated with the application and an identifier associated with the application . The application information may in some instances be transmitted based on search parameters provided by the user of the mobile device . For example the mobile device user may request information relating to applications of a specific type for example games. In response to receiving such a request the application delivery server may determine appropriate application information corresponding to applications meeting the desired criteria and transmit that application information to the mobile device .

The application information is received by the device at step . The mobile device may display at least some of the application information to the user of the mobile device using the display at step . The information presented on the display may include an option to purchase or download the application associated with the application information. Using an input mechanism such as for example the touchscreen display the control keys or another input mechanism a user may request the purchase or download of an application associated with the application information Step .

After receiving a request from the user to purchase or download the application the mobile device may transmit a request step to the application delivery server to request the transfer of the specified application to the mobile communication device . The request may include information identifying the application that the request relates to such as for example an identifier associated with the application . The request is received at the application delivery server at step .

At step the licensing module of the application delivery server retrieves a license key for the requested application . The license key may be retrieved from a local or remote data store. In some example embodiments the license key may be retrieved from another licensing server .

Some licensing methods may rely on a single license key which is associated with an application and which is used for all users of the application This method may be referred to as a single license method . In other licensing methods a pool of licensing keys may be associated with an application This may be referred to as a license pool method . The license keys in the pool may be handed out or otherwise assigned one at a time to each end user or mobile device . In other licensing methods which will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to dynamic licensing may be used This may be referred to as a dynamic licensing method . In a dynamic licensing method the license key may be generated specifically for a user based on information of a predetermined type. For example a license key may be generated based on a PIN associated with the mobile device or another identifier which identifies the device or its user.

The specific method of retrieving the license key may vary between systems or applications. In some example embodiments the method of retrieving a license key will be determined by the developer of the specific application . For example some developers may prefer to use the single license method others may prefer to use the license pool method and others may prefer the dynamic licensing method. In example embodiments which permit the developer to select which licensing method they prefer to use the application information which may be accessed by the application delivery server may include information specifying the preferred licensing method. In such example embodiments the licensing module may be configured to determine from the application information the method to be used for retrieving the license key .

Each application may include an authentication module for authenticating the application . That is the application may include computer executable instructions for determining whether a license key which has been associated with the application on the mobile communication device is a valid license key. Accordingly the license keys which are retrieved at step are license keys which are capable of being authenticated by the authentication module of the application .

At step the application is transmitted to the mobile device and is received at the mobile device at step . Similarly at step the license key is transmitted to the mobile device and is received at the mobile device at step . It will be appreciated that the specific order of transmitting the application and its associated license key may be different than the order discussed above. For example in some example embodiments the license key may be packaged with and transmitted with the application . In other example embodiments the license key may be transmitted prior to the application . Furthermore it will be appreciated that in some example embodiments the application may be transmitted at step prior to the license key being retrieved at step .

In some example embodiments the license key is displayed step on the display of the mobile communication device to permit a user of the device to create a backup copy of the license key such as for example a hard copy of the license key . In some example embodiments in order to increase the likelihood that the user will create a backup copy of the license key the mobile device may specifically prompt the user to do so.

Next at step in some example embodiments the application may be installed to the mobile device . The installation of the application may occur automatically or may be user initiated. Installation includes steps which are necessary or desirable to prepare the application for use including for example decompressing the received application placing a desktop icon on a home page of a graphical user interface associated with the mobile device so that the user may launch the application and creating a space to store files associated with the application such as one or more folders.

Next at step the license key is automatically injected into the application . The injection may occur as part of the installation method at step . The injection may be automatic and may not require any additional input from the user of the mobile device . The injection may be performed in response to receiving the license key .

In one example embodiment injecting the license key into the application includes setting one or more properties associated with the application . For example one property associated with the application may be a serial number or license key property. Prior to injecting the license key this property may be set to nil. The license injection module of the mobile communication device may change this property to be equal to the received license key . The received license key may then be deleted from any other locations where it was temporarily stored such as cache memory so that it is only stored in the properties of the application .

Referring now to a method for dynamically licensing the application will be discussed. In this model the license key is specifically generated for a specific mobile device or its user. The example embodiment of includes steps for execution by the application delivery server and steps for execution by the licensing server . It will be appreciated that the steps discussed with reference to could be performed in other locations for example on other servers. For example while the example embodiment of is a distributed solution in which not all of the steps are performed in the same location in some example embodiments the steps may be performed on a single server such as for example the application delivery server .

The distributed solution of in which both a licensing server and an application delivery server are used may be desirable in some systems. For example where the application delivery server and the licensing server are not owned or operated by the same entity the use of a separate licensing server permits the specific algorithm used to generate a license key to be kept secret from the operator of the application delivery server . For example a developer may own and or operate the licensing server and a store may own and or operate the application delivery server . Separating application delivery from license generation may be desirable since it allows the developer to rely on a generation algorithm which may not be supported by the application delivery server and since it allows the generation algorithm to be kept secret.

At step the application delivery server transmits a request to obtain a license key to the licensing server . The request may include identification information associated with one or both of the mobile device requesting the application or the user of the mobile device . For example the request may include the unique PIN associated with the mobile device and or an email address or other identifier associated with the user of the mobile device. The request may also include product identification information for identifying the application associated with the request. The product identification information may include a version number associated with the application. The request may be performed for example by submitting an Hyper Text Transmission Protocol HTTP post to a Universal Resource Locator URL associated with the licensing server . The request is received at the licensing server at step .

At step the licensing server generates the license key . The licensing server generates the license key according to a predetermined algorithm. The predetermined algorithm may rely on any identification information which was included in the request received at step and which identifies the mobile device or its user. For example the algorithm may rely on the PIN associated with the device. Accordingly it is possible to generate a license key which will work only on the device having the PIN which was used to generate that license key.

At step the generated license key is transmitted from the licensing server and is received at the application delivery server at step .
