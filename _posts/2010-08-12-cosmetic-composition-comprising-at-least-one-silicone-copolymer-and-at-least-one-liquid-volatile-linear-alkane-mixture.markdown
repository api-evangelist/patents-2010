This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 235 108 filed Aug. 19 2009. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to French Patent Application No. 0955660 filed Aug. 13 2009.

Disclosed herein is a composition for treating keratin fibers and for example human keratin fibers such as the hair and a method of treating keratin fibers comprising applying this composition to the keratin fibers.

There can be numerous styling products that may provide the hair with body mass or volume. One disadvantage associated with these products which are usually based on film forming polymers may lie in the fact that the cosmetic effect can disappear at the first shampooing.

It may be known practice to coat the hair with film forming polymers such as certain silicone copolymers based on silicone resin and fluid silicone such as copolymers under the name BioPSA. These copolymers are described for example in International Application Publication Nos. WO 03 026596 WO 2004 073626 WO 2007 051505 and WO 2007 051506 for various cosmetic applications such as application to the hair nails and skin.

This type of copolymer can be used to provide durable styling. When these copolymers are applied to the hair in a volatile solvent the individual hairs can generally be coated homogeneously while remaining separated and the coating obtained can generally be resistant to shampooing. This coating may provide the hair with body and mass in a durable way.

When these copolymers are used in a mixture with pigments a visible coloring can be generally obtained independently of the initial colour of the hair. This can be achieved moreover without prior bleaching of the hair. The presence of these pigments such as nacres may produce a visible chromatic coloring on hair. The coating obtained can be resistant to several shampooings.

However for good cosmetic and or homogeneity properties on the part of the resultant coating the rate of evaporation of the composition can be a key step. The rate of evaporation should not be too rapid otherwise the composition may not spread well along the lock and the coating may not form homogeneously a phenomena which can be manifested for example in increased difficulty in blow drying. The rate of evaporation should not be too slow otherwise solvent may remain trapped in the coating after the drying step and this can be detrimental to the cosmetic qualities of the coating. The volatile oils such as isododecane which are commonly used with copolymers based on silicone resin and fluid silicone have a rate of evaporation which can be too high. Moreover it is always useful to obtain coating compositions which can produce further enhanced durability.

Accordingly disclosed herein are homogeneous coatings resulting from compositions comprising solvents that have a rate of evaporation which can be appropriate for hair coating.

Also provided herein is a composition for treating keratin fibers comprising at least one silicone copolymer based on at least one silicone resin and at least one fluid silicone and at least one liquid volatile linear alkane comprising from 9 to 15 carbon atoms wherein the weight ratio of the at least one liquid volatile linear alkane to the at least one silicone copolymer has a value greater than or equal to 2. Also provided is a method of treating keratin fibers comprising applying this composition to the keratin fibers.

The use of the at least one liquid volatile linear alkane in combination with the at least one silicone copolymer as described above can make it possible to optimize the rate of evaporation thereby facilitating the application of the composition and or ensuring good homogeneity of the coating on the hair.

This method when employed with a composition comprising at least one pigment may produce homogeneous coatings having an intense and or chromatic coloring for example on dark keratin fibers.

According to at least one embodiment dark keratin fibers or hair may have a tone level lower than or equal to 6 dark blonde and for example lower than or equal to 4 chestnut .

The term tone level is based on the classification of natural shades one tone separating each shade from that immediately following or preceding it. This definition and the classification of the natural shades may be well known to styling professionals and are published in the book Sciences des traitements capillaires by Charles Zviak 1988 published by Masson pp. 215 and 278.

The tone levels run from 1 black to 10 light light blonde with one unit corresponding to one tone the higher the number the lighter the shade.

The at least one silicone copolymer disclosed herein is derived from the reaction between at least one silicone resin and at least one fluid silicone.

Application of the composition can be subsequently followed by drying at a temperature above 40 C. According to at least one embodiment this temperature is above 45 C. According at least one embodiment this temperature is above 45 C. and below 220 C.

The drying can be carried out immediately after the application or after a leave in time that can range from 1 minute to 30 minutes.

According to at least one embodiment in addition to a supply of heat the hair can be dried using a flow of air. This flow of air during drying makes it possible to improve the individualization of the coating.

During drying a mechanical action on the locks may be exerted such as combing brushing or running the fingers through.

The drying step of the method disclosed herein may be performed with a hood a hairdryer and or a straightener etc.

When the drying step is performed with a hood or a hairdryer the drying temperature can range from 40 to 110 C. such as from 50 to 90 C.

When the drying step is performed with a straightener the drying temperature can range from 110 C. to 220 C. such as from 140 C. to 200 C. degrees.

Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations unless otherwise indicated the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value however inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. By way of non limiting illustration concrete examples of certain embodiments of the present disclosure are given below.

The present disclosure can be more fully illustrated with the aid of the following non limiting examples.

0.3 g of composition A was applied to a 1 g lock of clean dry hair with a tone level of 4. After a waiting time of 2 minutes the lock was blown dry with a hairdryer at a temperature of 80 C. for 2 minutes. This gave a lock in which the individual hairs were separate and had body the volumization obtained being durable to shampooing.

When 0.3 g of composition A was applied under the same conditions to a 1 g lock of clean dry hair with a tone level of 4 blow drying of the lock with a hairdryer was more difficult to perform with the brush running less easily through the hair.

0.3 g of the composition was applied to a 1 g lock of clean dry hair with a tone level of 4. After a waiting time of 2 minutes the lock was blown dry with a hairdryer at a temperature of 80 C. for 2 minutes. This gave a lock in which the individual hairs were separate and had body the volumization obtained being durable to shampooing.

0.6 g of composition B was applied to a 1 g lock of clean dry hair with a tone level of 4. After a waiting time of 2 minutes the lock was blown dry with a hairdryer at a temperature of 80 C. for 2 minutes. This gave a colored lock in which the individual hairs were separate and the color was very uniform and durable to shampooing.
