title: Structures and components comprising blast-resistant concrete also suitable for limiting penetration of ballistic fragments
abstract: Concrete structures and components with improved strength and toughness. A uniform mix of first constituents comprises: cement of Blaine fineness of 280-360 m/kg; sand at a mass ratio of 0.75-1.25 of the cement; silica fume at a mass ratio of 0.15-0.4 of the cement; silica flour at a mass ratio of 0.15-0.3 of the cement; and microinclusions at a mass ratio up to 0.35 of the cement. This is then mixed with a blend of second constituents comprising a specified amount of an HRWRA and an amount of water at a mass ratio of 0.2-0.35 of the cement. This is mixed sufficiently to form a uniform cement-based paste to which an amount of macrofibers at a mass ratio of up to 0.35 of the cement is added to yield a uniform product. Nanoinclusions may be added to improve crack resistance and increase density.
