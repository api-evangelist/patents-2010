The present invention relates generally to downloading and more particularly to methods and systems for facilitating remote downloading.

Mobile endpoints e.g. smartphones are generating downloading and storing an increasing amount of data. This growth in data consumption is outpacing advances in wireless technologies. Moreover it is not practical from a cost or performance perspective to provide the mobile endpoints with large amounts of on board storage.

One technique for reducing the local storage requirements of mobile endpoints is to move file downloads off the mobile endpoint and onto a user s home server e.g. a Samba Server . This technique often requires the user to first setup a server with a network file system NFS e.g. NFS Microsoft Server Message Block or Samba at home. Then in order to allow the user to remotely access the home server the user may have to enable remote access to the home server from networks outside of their home. Once configured the user is then able to save files to the home server over the NFS. In order to save files on the home server the mobile endpoint downloads a file that it then uploads to the home server over the NFS. While this may reduce the storage requirements of the mobile endpoint its implementation is inefficient because it requires the data to be moved over both a downlink and uplink in the wireless network. Moreover the mobile endpoint has to maintain a wireless connection to both download and upload the file. If the connection is dropped during either portion of the download process the operation fails.

One technique for reducing the load on the wireless network is based on a remote desktop platform. This technique often requires the user to setup and enable the remote desktop function at their home computer. Once enabled the user may remotely operate their computer from their mobile endpoint. While this allows the file to be downloaded using the user s home network connection trying to manage and interface with a home computer using a mobile endpoint can be unwieldy. For example the response time of the interactions on the remote desktop is slow because of the substantial amount of messages exchanged between the home computer and the mobile endpoint. As another example the small screen of a mobile endpoint makes it difficult to operate the higher resolution of the home computer.

The teachings of the present disclosure relates to methods and systems for facilitating remote downloading that include receiving at a home media gateway associated with at least a first endpoint a remote download request generated by a web browser running on the first endpoint. The remote download request is relayed to the home media gateway via at least one component of a wireless service provider s network. The wireless service provider provides user authentication for the remote download request. The remote download request includes an address associated with at least one file hosted by a remote server. The method also includes downloading the at least one file from the remote server to the home media gateway. The method further includes upon detecting a presence of the first endpoint uploading the at least one file from the home media gateway to the endpoint.

Technical advantages of particular embodiments include allowing a user to use his endpoint to request his home media gateway to download a file. Accordingly the traffic load of a wireless service provider s wireless network is reduced. Additionally the user is not required to maintain a data connection as the file is downloaded.

Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following figures descriptions and claims. Moreover while specific advantages have been enumerated above various embodiments may include all some or none of the enumerated advantages.

For simplicity and ease of discussion the remainder of this description may use a simplified nomenclature for the various entities servers and networks discussed herein. Home location may refer to a place at which a user has home network access to an external network such as the internet. A home location is not limited to only a user s residence it may include for example a user s office. Home network access may refer to any of a variety of techniques and or technologies used to access one or more external networks such as the internet from the user s home location. For example home network access may comprise a cable modem a digital subscriber line DSL modem an xDSL modem etc. Home network may refer to a local area network LAN configured within a user s home location. The LAN may include both wired and wireless connections. The term internet is not intended to be limited to only the Internet but includes any type of network including public and private networks which an fBS may use to establish its backhaul connection to a wireless service provider s network. Internet service provider ISP may refer to an entity that provides a user with his home network access service. Wireless service may refer to any of a variety of techniques and technologies e.g. Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX or Long Term Evolution LTE used to provide endpoints with wireless connections. Wireless service provider WSP may refer to the entity that provides the wireless service. Wireless network may refer to any devices or components e.g. base stations used to provide the wireless service. Mobile wireless network may refer to the wireless network minus any user equipment that provides wireless service e.g. a femto base station . In some embodiments the mobile wireless network may be the publicly available portion of the wireless network. For example a femto base station at a user s home location may be part of the wireless network but may not be a part of the mobile wireless network. As another example a macro base station outside the user s home location may be part of both the wireless network and the mobile wireless network. While this nomenclature is used for simplicity it does not represent the entire scope of all possible embodiments. For example an ISP may also be the WSP. As another example the ISP may not be directly providing the user with internet access e.g. the ISP may provide a building with internet access the building owner may then provide the fBS user with internet access .

In particular embodiments a user may use their mobile endpoint e.g. endpoint to identify a file to download e.g. a movie . The file may then either be downloaded locally at mobile endpoint or remotely at the user s home media gateway HMG e.g. HMG . To download the file the user s endpoint may send a download request to the HMG via the wireless service provider s network. Because the request is communicated through the WSP s network the HMG can trust the request without requiring separate user authentication. HMG may then use the user s home network access to download the file. When the user returns home and is connected to his home network e.g. via fBS or the user may then download the file to his endpoint.

The embodiment depicted in includes fBSs . fBSs may in essence be small base stations purchased or leased by the user from his WSP. Once installed the fBS provides a geographically small coverage area that may be used to enhance the signal coverage within the user s premise. Depending on the scenario the user may share this coverage with other unknown users e.g. the fBS is a public fBS or he may limit it to known authorized users e.g. the fBS is a private fBS . In some embodiments fBSs may use the same wireless technology as the surrounding base stations . In particular embodiments fBSs may use the same licensed spectrum e.g. the spectrum licensed by the user s WSP as the WSP s other local MBSs and RSs .

Part of the installation process for the fBS may include providing it with internet access for its backhaul connection. In the scenario depicted in fBSs are connected to network access devices . Network access devices provide their respective users with home network access. The connection between each respective fBS and network access device may provide fBSs with their backhaul connection to the WSP s network also referred to as a wireless service network WSN network

In the depicted embodiment HMGs are coupled to network access device . Each HMG may use its connection with a respective network access device to download files requested by a user. The downloaded content may be stored locally at HMG or at any other component e.g. an external hard drive accessible by HMG that is able to store data. HMG may receive a user s instructions to download the file from for example a particular web server. The instructions may be relayed to HMG via for example fBS network access device or any other component of the WSP s network. Because the instructions may be sent via fBS or some other component of the WSP s network HMG may rely on the WSP s authentication of the user and or instruction. Thus the endpoint or user may not have to send authentication information to log into HMG . In some embodiments the instructions may be relayed via the internet.

In particular embodiments the user of fBS may be the owner of fBS or a user authorized by the owner to use fBS . In particular embodiments those users authorized to use fBS may also be able take advantage of the remote downloading ability of HMG . In some embodiments HMG may have its own list of authorized users distinct from the list of authorized users associated with fBS .

Although the example communication system of includes six different networks networks the term network should be interpreted as generally defining any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals data and or messages including signals data or messages transmitted through WebPages e mail file transfers text chat voice over IP VoIP and instant messaging. Depending on the scope size and or configuration of the network any one of networks may be implemented as a LAN Wide Area Network WAN MAN PSTN WiMAX network global distributed network such as the Internet Intranet Extranet or any other form of wireless or wired networking.

Networks may include any number and combination of wired links wireless connections nodes and or endpoints . For purposes of illustration and only by way of example network is a MAN that may be implemented at least in part via WiMAX LTE any 3G or 4G wireless technology or any other type of wireless service network is a PSTN network is a LAN network is a WAN such as the internet network is a WSN which may be operated by the WSP responsible for providing network with wireless service e.g. WiMAX and network is an internet service network ISN which may be operated by the ISP responsible for providing its users with home network access including internet access. Though not depicted in both WSN network and ISN network may include servers modems gateways and any other components that may be needed to provide their respective service.

While networks have been depicted as six separate networks depending on the scenario any two or more of the networks may be a single network. For example the WSP and the ISP may be the same business entity which may maintain the necessary components for both services on the same network thus merging ISN network and WSN network into a single network. Furthermore the interconnections between networks may vary from those depicted in . For example if a user uses a Digital Subscriber Line DSL connection for his internet access his network access device may connect to PSTN

Generally networks provide for the communication of packets cells frames or other portions of information generally referred to as packets herein between endpoints and or nodes described below . In particular embodiments networks and may be IP networks. IP networks transmit data by placing the data in packets and sending each packet individually to the selected destination along one or more communication paths. Network may for example be a PSTN that may include switching stations central offices mobile telephone switching offices pager switching offices remote terminals and other related telecommunications equipment that are located throughout the world. Network may be coupled to network through a gateway. Depending on the embodiment the gateway may be a part of network and or e.g. nodes and or may comprise a gateway . The gateway may allow PSTN to be able to communicate with non PSTN networks such as any one of networks or 

Any of networks or may be coupled to other IP networks including but not limited to the Internet. Because IP networks share a common method of transmitting data signals may be transmitted between devices located on different but interconnected IP networks. In addition to being coupled to other IP networks any of networks or may also be coupled to non IP networks through the use of interfaces or components such as gateways.

Networks may be connected to each other and with other networks via a plurality of wired links wireless connections and nodes . Not only do wired links wireless connections and nodes connect various networks but they also interconnect endpoints with one another and with any other components coupled to or a part of any of networks . The interconnection of networks may enable endpoints to communicate data and control signaling between each other as well as allowing any intermediary components or devices to communicate data and control signals. Accordingly users of endpoints may be able to send and receive data and control signals between and among each network component coupled to one or more of networks .

In the depicted embodiment wireless connections may represent wireless links between two components using for example WiMAX. In other embodiments wireless connections may use other wireless technologies and or protocols such as LTE or LTE Advanced LTE A . The extended range of a WiMAX MBS along with one or more RSs and fBSs may allow network to cover the larger geographic area associated with a MAN.

Nodes may include any combination of network components modems session border controllers gatekeepers ISN gateways WSN gateways security gateways operation administration maintenance and provisioning OAM P servers network access provider NAP servers base stations conference bridges routers hubs switches gateways endpoints or any other hardware software or embedded logic implementing any number of communication protocols that allow for the exchange of packets in communication system . For example node may comprise a gateway. As a gateway node may allow network a PSTN network to be able to transmit and receive communications from other non PSTN networks such as network an IP network. More specifically as a gateway node may translate communications between the various protocols used by networks and

Network access devices may provide home network access to fBSs and HMG through any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . In some embodiments network access device may be supplied by the user s ISP. For example if the user s ISP is a cable company then the ISP may supply a cable modem as network access device . As another example if the user s ISP is a phone company then the ISP may supply an xDSL modem as network access device . As may be apparent network access device may provide home network access to components other than fBSs and HMG . For example the user may connect his personal computer to network access device to access the internet.

Endpoints and or nodes may provide data or network services to a user through any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . For example endpoints may include a cell phone an IP telephone a computer a video monitor a camera a personal data assistant or any other hardware software and or encoded logic that supports the communication of packets or frames using one or more of networks . Endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that can send or receive data and or signals.

Networks may comprise any number of separate but interconnected networks operated by one or more different operators. For example network may comprise the ISP s network and network may comprise the WSP s network. A user may use their ISP s network for their home network access at their home location. In providing the user with home network access the ISP s network may include modems servers and gateways e.g. an ISP gateway . A user may use their WSP s wireless network to supply the user with his wireless service. The wireless network may support technologies and or protocols such as a WiMAX LTE A or LTE. In providing the wireless service the WSP s network may utilize servers and gateways. One or more components of network may provide authentication and or authorization for endpoint . HMG may take advantage of this authentication by not requiring the user to send separate or additional authentication information. Networks may comprise any number of additional networks including but not limited to the internet a LAN WAN MAN PSTN or some combination of the above.

fBS may in essence be a small base station providing a limited coverage area for a home or office. Depending on the embodiment and configuration of fBS it may be public or private. fBS may rely on the user s home network access e.g. via a modem not depicted provided by the user s ISP to provide the backhaul connection to the WSP s network. In certain embodiments HMG and fBS may comprise a single device. For example a WSP may lease to a user fBS with HMG integrated therein. The combined device may provide the user with base station like wireless coverage for the user s home and the remote downloading functionality of HMG . HMG may be integrated in any of a variety of home gateway related products including wireline routers Wi Fi 802.11 access points WiMAX 802.16 femtocell base station 2G 3G LTE femtocell base station network access device home storage system etc.

Server may comprise any combination of hardware and or encoded logic or software including firmware needed to host files for downloading. Server may use any one or more of a variety of access control methods to limit user access to available files. The method used may impact the type of request and set of credentials needed to access content hosted by server . For example one common security method used for access control is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS . For HMG to be able to download a file from server using HTTPS storage of HMG may need to store information such as a session ID a random number a cipher suite server s public key and any other information needed to successfully gain access to server s content.

The following examples may help to illustrate how these components inter work with one another to provide the functionality of particular embodiments. Assume that while a user is traveling away from his home location the user is using a web browser running on their endpoint to search for movies. Once the user finds a movie to watch the movie may be downloaded and saved at the user s HMG . In some embodiments endpoint may receive a message indicating that HMG has finished downloading the movie. When the user returns to his home location the movie will be ready for use. For example the user may watch the movie at home or download the movie to endpoint using a relatively fast connection e.g. a wired or wireless link such as Ethernet USB or Wi Fi as compared to the wireless connection provided by the mobile wireless network while the user is away from his home location. While this example is focused on a movie remote downloading may be used for any file to be downloaded including for example system software upgrades for endpoint . In some embodiments the file being downloaded to HMG may comprise files hosted by the WSP that the user is able to select using the user s subscription account e.g. transactions at the WSP s media store may be carried out within the WSP s network thus providing a secure shopping experience .

Downloading the file to HMG from server may be achieved through a variety of techniques. For example in some embodiments storage may store a proxy program that processor may execute to allow HMG to accept connections from endpoint when endpoint is outside the coverage area of the user s home network. In certain embodiments HMG may not need login information from endpoint because HMG may rely on the user authentication provided by the WSP. In some embodiments the proxy program may be installed at fBS an access point or a computer inside the user s home network. The proxy program may work in concert with a plug in that is maintained in storage of endpoint . Processor may run the plug in to intercept reformat and redirect at least some download requests e.g. requests for files greater than a threshold number of bytes made from the user s browser. The intercepted requests may be directed through the WSP s network to the proxy program running on HMG .

In particular embodiments a user may decide whether or not to send a request to HMG . For example when processor recognizes that a user is attempting to download a file endpoint may generate a prompt asking the user if the file should be downloaded locally or at HMG . Depending on the embodiment the prompt may be generated automatically e.g. anytime a user attempts to download any file any file over a certain size or a particular file type or based on user input e.g. a user presses a button on endpoint to call up the prompt . The prompt may be a menu entry a pop up window a new page or any other type of prompt. For example in some embodiments a user may press a button that calls for a popup menu with an option to save link to home in addition to or instead of an option to save link as. In some embodiments processor may generate a new hyper link within the webpage as displayed by endpoint s browser. For example a webpage provided by server may comprise a hyperlink to download a movie. Processor may recognize that the hyperlink is to download a movie and may when rendering the webpage add a second hyperlink proximate to the original hyperlink. The new hyperlink may be distinct from the original hyperlink so as to alert the user that selecting the second hyperlink will download the movie to storage of HMG and selecting the original hyperlink will download the movie locally to storage of endpoint .

Once it has been determined that a file is to be downloaded by HMG endpoint may instead of sending a request to server send a request to the proxy program run by HMG . The request may include the user s security credentials and or any log in information needed to access and or download the requested file from server . In some embodiments the request may be sent to HMG without the user first logging into HMG . For example HMG may rely on the user authentication provided by the WSP and or the WSP s network. In particular embodiments storage of HMG may maintain at least some of the user s credentials thus the request from endpoint may not contain all the credentials needed to download files from server . In some embodiments the request may comprise a format similar to the following plain English syntax Please download the file xxx at url y.y.y and store it at the home directory zzz. 

When HMG receives a request from endpoint to download a file from server interface may send a request e.g. an HTTP request to server requesting the file for download. The request may include information provided by endpoint and or information stored by storage . After server accepts the request from HMG HMG may start to download the file on behalf of endpoint . In some embodiments once the download is complete interface of HMG may send a message to endpoint indicating that the file has been successfully downloaded.

When the user returns home endpoint may be able to access the file downloaded by HMG via a wireline or wireless link such as Ethernet USB Bluetooth Wi Fi WiMAX or LTE. The download from HMG to endpoint may be completed without endpoint using the resources of the mobile wireless network. The download time from HMG to endpoint may be much shorter than the download time using a MBS s wireless connection from the mobile wireless network. Depending on the embodiment the file may be downloaded from HMG to endpoint as soon as endpoint has a connection to HMG after endpoint or HMG receive a request to download the file from HMG to endpoint at a predetermined or scheduled time at any other convenient or suitable time or after any convenient or suitable triggering event.

In some scenarios and or embodiments HMG may need user credentials in order to access or download a file from server . These credentials may be provided by endpoint over a secure connection. For example in some embodiments an Internet Protocol Security IPSec connection may be established between endpoint and HMG . When a user requests that HMG download a file endpoint may use the secure connection to send the user s credentials to HMG . In some embodiments the request may comprise a format similar to the following plain English syntax Please use username uuu and password ppp to download file xxx at url y.y.y and store it at directory zzz. 

In some cases a certificate may be needed during the first connection to server to authenticate the identity of the user. In such cases it may be that HMG or the proxy program running thereon sends its own certificate along with the user s username and or password to server . In particular embodiments processor of HMG may be able to parse the response messages from server so as to reply with the correct responses. This may allow the proxy program to behave like a client browser thus server may be unaware that it is communicating with a proxy program.

In certain embodiments if server requires information that HMG and or the proxy program are unable to provide e.g. a web site that asks additional security questions if it receives an HTTP request from an unfamiliar IP address or without a proper cookie interface may transmit a message to endpoint . The message may be transmitted via the secure connection. Depending on the nature or type of information that is needed the user may send additional information to HMG from endpoint or the user may wait until they are at their home location and then connect to server from their home computer to manually entering the information needed by server .

In some embodiments HMG may be an integrated component of fBS . In many situations the WSP may lease fBS to a user while keeping fBS as part of the WSP s infrastructure. This may prevent fBS and HMG from being accessible by the user directly through the internet. In such a scenario the WSP may provide the user with limited access to fBS through the WSP s network. This access through the WSP s network may increase the trust between HMG and requests from endpoint . A similar trust may be established in certain embodiments in which HMG is connected to fBS .

In particular embodiments HMG may be configured so that the proxy program run by HMG is able to use the same authentication credentials e.g. security keys password cookies digital signatures etc as endpoint . In certain embodiments the authentication credentials may be synchronized between endpoint and HMG when endpoint is connected to HMG in a secure way e.g. through the user s home network . In some scenarios the user may be able to set a policy on how the credentials are synchronized maintained and or deleted.

In some embodiments where fBS and or HMG are only accessible through the WSP s network the WSP may provide a relay feature to allow endpoint to send receive messages to from fBS and or HMG . In particular embodiments a control node e.g. a Mobility Management Entity MME associated with the WSP s network may register the address of fBS and or HMG . Once registered the user may then be able to remotely send download requests to HMG . The request may be sent for example through the WSP s network as opposed to through the internet using the relay feature and the registered address of fBS and or HMG . HMG may then download the requested file via the user s home network access. Because the request is transmitted through the WSP s network it may be more secure than having the request sent via the internet. While the request is transmitted primarily through the WSP s network the majority of the traffic e.g. the downloaded file does not go through the mobile operator s network nor use resources of the mobile wireless network.

Thus far several different embodiments and features have been presented. Particular embodiments may combine one or more of these features depending on operational needs and or component limitations. This may allow for great adaptability of network to the needs of various organizations and users. For example in particular embodiments HMG may be combined with fBS . Some embodiments may include additional or different features. In particular embodiments the functionality of HMG may be a part of any home gateway equipment including a router with Ethernet or Wi Fi access a LTE HeNB Home eNodeB or WiMAX femto base station. Moreover the ability to remotely download files may be implemented in any time of wireless technology.

The method begins at step with the generation of a remote download request. The download request may be generated by an endpoint. For example a user may be browsing a website comprising movie downloads. When a user identifies a movie to be downloaded the user may direct the endpoint to have the file downloaded to the user s HMG. In some embodiments the endpoint may automatically generate the request any time a user selects a large file e.g. a file greater than a threshold number of bits or when the downloading of the file will take a long time e.g. exceeds a threshold amount of time based for example on file size and available bandwidth . In some embodiments the request may be generated based on an explicit indication received from a user. In some embodiments or scenarios the request may be generated by a component or device within the WSP s network. For example in issuing a software update for the endpoint a component of the WSP s may generate the remote download request to have the HMG download the software update. In some embodiments or scenarios the request may be generated by a third party component. For example the user may have a subscription to one or more online magazines newspapers podcasts or other content. As another example the user may use the HMG as a social networking port for non urgent updates. A download request may be generated whenever new content is available for either a subscription or from a social networking port. The above of are just a few examples of instances where it may be suitable to have a HMG download a file on behalf of a user and then upload the file to the endpoint.

At step the user s HMG receives the remote download request. The request may be received via the WSP s network. This may allow the HMG to take advantage of the user authentication performed by the WSP and or the WSP s network. The remote download request may include at least an address associated with a server and or file to be downloaded by the HMG. In particular embodiments and or scenarios the remote download request may include the user s login information and or security credentials for access to the server and or its contents. Compared to downloading the file sending the remote download request results in only a small amount of data being sent over the mobile wireless network. In addition because the endpoint s involvement in the downloading of the file from the server essentially ends with the sending of the request the endpoint need not stay connected to the wireless network while the file is downloaded to the HMG.

At step the HMG downloads the file from the server specified in the remote download request. In downloading the file the HMG may use the user s home network access. Downloading the file to the HMG via the user s home network access may reduce the traffic demands placed on the mobile wireless network. In some embodiments the HMG may wait until a scheduled time of day before it downloads the file from the server.

At step a message is sent to the endpoint indicating that the file has been downloaded. The message may be sent in any of a variety of ways including but not limited to email text message voice mail instant message an audible tone a pop up window an alert window or any other way which may alert a user that the HMG has finished downloading the requested file.

At step the endpoint s presence is detected by the HMG. This may comprise the endpoint being connected directly to the HMG or to a router or switch that is also connected to the HMG or this may comprise the endpoint having established a wireless connection e.g. Wi Fi LTE WiMAX etc. between for example the endpoint and the HMG the fBS or a Wi Fi access point. In some embodiments the endpoint s presence may not be detected until the endpoint explicitly signals to the HMG that it is ready to download the file. For example the user may select an option or press a button on the endpoint to request the file be downloaded from the HMG to the endpoint. In some embodiments the file may be downloaded whenever the user syncs his endpoint.

At step the file is downloaded from the HMG to the endpoint. The downloading may be done using any of a variety of techniques interfaces and or mediums. For example the file may be downloaded to the endpoint using the same wireless interface that the endpoint uses to communicate within the WSP s wireless network e.g. a LTE wireless interface . As another example the endpoint may download the file using a different wireless interface such as a Wi Fi connection. As another example the file may be downloaded using a wired interface such as Ethernet or USB either directly or indirectly with the HMG. The file may be downloaded to the endpoint automatically or upon request from the endpoint. For example the endpoint may begin to download the file once it is connected to the user s home network. As another example the endpoint may wait until a scheduled time of day to download the file.

Although particular embodiments have been described in detail it should be understood that various other changes substitutions and alterations may be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of particular embodiments. For example while the embodiment depicted in includes a certain number of steps depicted in a certain order it is to be understood that other embodiments may have more fewer or different steps and the steps may be rearranged. For example in some embodiments the HMG may not send a message to the endpoint indicating that the file has been downloaded or the message may be sent after the endpoints presence has been detected.

As another example although an embodiment has been described with reference to a number of elements included within communication system such as endpoints fBSs MBS and RSs these elements may be combined rearranged or positioned in order to accommodate particular routing architectures or needs. In addition any of these elements may be provided as separate external components to communication system or each other where appropriate. Particular embodiments contemplate great flexibility in the arrangement of these elements as well as their internal components.

Numerous other changes substitutions variations alterations and modifications may be ascertained by those skilled in the art and it is intended that the present invention encompass all such changes substitutions variations alterations and modifications as falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
