title: Generating package profiles in software package repositories using selective subsets of packages
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for generating package profiles in software package repositories using selective subsets of packages. A physical or virtual client machine can host a set of installed software packages, including operating system, application, and/or other software. A package manager tracks the set of installed packages and reports the inventory of those packages to one or more package servers. The package server(s) can build an aggregate package population record reflecting all packages installed on all machines in the managed network. The package server(s) can then generate arbitrarily selected package subsets from the aggregate package collection, and group or configure sets of machines based on common or compatible package subsets. Machine groups dedicated to different tasks or applications as reflected in their package subsets can then have updating, security, and/or other management tasks carried out on a collective basis.

The present teachings relate to systems and methods for generating package profiles in software package repositories using selective subsets of packages and more particularly to platforms and techniques for capturing aggregate package populations in a managed network on the package server side and generating arbitrary subsets of those groupings for updating maintenance or other management operations.

Users of physical or virtual machines commonly install software packages including package updates to physical or virtual machines. The software packages can contain a set of related files chosen to perform a given application or task such as for example a group of software applications drivers and or other resources used to install and use messaging applications. In instances a software package can contain application software operating system software drivers patches and or other software components grouped as a logical set.

Software package update managers exist to help a user initiate and perform software package updates such as for example the yum Yellowdog update manager package update manager available from Red Hat Inc. and others. In general available software package managers are configured to interact with the set of installed packages on a client and with one or more software package repositories to directly connect to those databases and download available package updates. In cases the package update can be formatted as a single combined file containing the various component files and can be compressed for easier transmission.

The task of managing a network of physical and possibly virtual machines can be complicated by the need to identify and track the population of the machines under management and the various software package complements installed on those machines. The machines under management and their package complements may need to be identified and tracked for a variety of purposes including for instance to identify and schedule package updates activate and deactivate machines assigned to networks including on premise and cloud networks to perform maintenance or other package or network management tasks.

In various networks for example including those having multiple network administrators or servers or consoles used for management the task of maintaining an inventory of machines the software packages installed on those machines the files contained in packages or other resources may become increasingly difficult to coordinate. In cases network administrators or other users may wish to perform a discovery or inventory process on machines in the managed network. The discovery or inventory results may be used to build an inventory of packages that are installed on all machines of the managed network on a total or aggregate basis.

An administrator or other user may further wish to group or characterize machines in the managed network based on selected package sets or files contained within those sets. They may wish to group or identify sets of machines hosting defined packages whether or not machines or groups of machines were initially configured or arranged to be related by their software complement or not. For example an administrator may wish to identify all machines in a managed network having a set of installed packages containing software resources such as specified compilers or debuggers for an application development product or project. The administrator or other user may wish to locate all machines currently hosting that set of packages or application without having to analyze all machines present on the network.

In cases the administrator or other user might want to determine the population of all such machines on the managed network whether or not those machines were initially provisioned or organized together. This might take place in a scenario where developer workstations are added over time to an engineering team for example.

Moreover the administrator or other user may wish to discover and characterize machines or groups of machines having different or selectable combinations of package sets which the user may flexibly or dynamically define. For instance an administrator or other user may in one regard wish to generate a view or slice of the managed network to determine which machines contain a combination of video or audio production software media player s and or other packages or software and may therefore be functioning as digital media workstations.

The user may also wish at the same or other time to determine which machines in the managed network also or instead are currently hosting a defined set of email chat voice over IP Internet protocol social network and or other packages or component software and which subset of the managed network may therefore be acting as messaging platforms. In cases some or all machines hosting one package subset of interest may overlap with machines hosting a second package subset within the same managed network or may represent distinct groupings requiring different or separate updates or other maintenance. In current package management platforms the administrator or other user may not be provided with tools or capability to create group and manage machines in the network based on arbitrary and or freely selectable package subsets across all machines in the managed network. It may be desirable to provide systems and methods for generating package profiles in software package repositories using selective subsets of packages in which an administrator or other user can access the entire population of packages installed in a managed network and select a variety of subsets of packages in the network by which to group organize and manage client machines.

Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for generating package profiles in software package repositories using selective subsets of packages. More particularly embodiments related to platforms and techniques for taking an overall inventory of the set of packages in a managed network storing that package population inventory in a centralized location and generating arbitrary subsets of that overall complement to identify track or manage machines which share those package subsets. In aspects a package manager can track and manage the installation of one or more software packages and or updates to those packages which may be referred to together as a software package update and or package installation on a client host target physical virtual and or other machine. The local package manager can be configured to access the set of installed packages and or selectable subsets of those packages and their related attributes on the client or other machine and derive or generate an inventory of the packages and or constituent files present on that associated machine. In embodiments the inventory of the set of installed packages can comprise a list tree and or other record of the software applications installed on a client machine in the managed network. In aspects the inventory of the set of installed packages for a client machine can be captured and reported by the local package manager installed on that machine and or by other local or remote software services or logic.

According to further regards the package manager and or other logic can transmit or communicate the inventory of the set of installed packages of a subject client machine to one or more than one remote management platforms. The one or more remote management platforms can be or include one or more package servers and or one or more repositories associated with the server s and or other platforms or logic. In embodiments the one or more package servers and or other logic can receive the respective inventory of the set of installed packages from some or all machines on the managed network. The one or more package servers and or other logic can capture and store the package inventories from all machines reporting those inventories and build an aggregate package population record that lists or records all packages on all machines present in the managed network. That aggregate package population record can store and record the hosted packages by various content identifiers or attributes including names or other package IDs version numbers file contents of the packages and or other data related to the total package complement installed across the entire managed network. In aspects the one or more package servers and or other platforms or logic can sort search extract and or otherwise select any one or more arbitrary subsets of packages found in the aggregate package population record. For instance an administrator or other user may wish to identify and group machines hosting a certain email package in one grouping and machines hosting various browser types or versions into different groups or series of groups. In aspects the package server s and or other remote platforms that develop the selected package subsets can then carry out provisioning security maintenance and or other management operations on the subsets of client machines in the managed network defined by their subset complement on a differentiated basis.

For instance the inventory of the set of installed packages for each machine on the managed network can be transmitted to stored in or accessed by a remote package server and or software package repository to build the aggregate package population record and permit software package updates and other operations to be performed on various defined package subsets of those machines. In aspects the aggregate package population record and or package subsets packages can in addition or instead be transmitted to or accessed by a network management platform not necessarily dedicated to package operations to identify the subject machine s or groups of machines related by installed package subsets for network maintenance security and or other management operations.

In aspects after the aggregate package population record and selected package subsets have been initially generated newly connected machines in a managed network can be automatically discovered or identified and have their package inventories automatically captured reported and added to the total complement. According to aspects the one or more package servers and or other logic can automatically assign newly discovered machines to one or more existing machines groups based on the selected package subsets that may be present on those newly attached systems. The resulting machine populations across various groupings and package subsets can thereby be registered and tracked by the package server s and or other platforms or logic based on those groupings and identifications. In aspects the selected package subsets can likewise be revised and updated at any time for instance to create new package subsets and or delete existing subsets that have been previously defined. These and other embodiments described herein address the various noted shortcomings in known package management and network management technology and provide a user with enhanced package and system management capability including the ability to identify and manage arbitrary package subsets in a managed network or other installation.

Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

In aspects the set of installed software packages can be or include packages comprising various types of applications such as for example messaging applications spreadsheet or modeling applications social networking applications word processing applications modeling applications media applications and or other applications software or utilities. In aspects the set of installed software packages can in aspects include an operating system drivers and or components thereof. The set of installed packages can have an associated set of package attributes which records file names versions dates storage size software or hardware requirements an or other attributes or metadata related to the software packages and or their updates installed on client . In aspects a user may browse set of installed packages in list or other form via selector tool or other interface to check or otherwise select one or more packages to analyze manage and or identify on client .

In aspects and as also shown the package manager can communicate with a network interface configured to connect to one or more network such as the public Internet or other public or private networks. The package manager can thereby connect to one or more package servers and or associated one or more package repositories hosting software packages including software package updates and or other software or resources. The one or more package servers can in embodiments include logic to identify organize and distribute one or more software packages to requesting client server virtual and or other machines.

In aspects the package manager can interact with the set of installed packages one or more package servers and or the associated one or more package repositories via network interface and one or more networks to identify and manage the content of set of installed packages operating on client . The package manager of each client in the managed network can develop and inventory of the set of installed packages of each machine and report that inventory data to the one or more package servers . In aspects the package manager can for example provide a user with a selector tool displayed via user interface such as a graphical user interface or others to select various test configuration inventory and or other management activities on the set of installed packages . The package manager displays via the user interface for example applications on the set of installed software packages . The selector tool can present options to select packages for installation and or update and or to carry out various other installation options. The selector tool can likewise present options to initiate an inventory of the set of installed packages located on client and or other selectable options or parameters for managing the package complement of the client .

In aspects in general the package manager can access and extract information related to set of installed packages to generate the inventory of the set of installed packages and transmit that inventory to the one or more package servers and or associated one or more repositories . The inventory of the set of installed packages extracted from each client can contain a list or other record or enumeration of the set of installed packages on the client such as the package name or other package identifier for each package installed present and or hosted on the client . In aspects the inventory of the set of installed packages can be arranged as a list database tree and or other record or data object. In aspects the inventory of the set of installed packages can in addition or instead incorporate some or all of the set of package attributes for each package identified in the set of installed packages and or inventory of the set of installed packages .

It may be noted that in embodiments the package manager can generate the inventory of the set of installed packages and associated data in an encoded format. In aspects package manager may for instance generate a string label value address and or other identifier which identifies or associates client by or with its hosted set of installed packages and or one or more selected package subset of the set of installed packages . For instance the package manager can generate the inventory of the set of installed packages or components thereof as the output of a hash function or hash operation performed on one or more attributes contained in set of package attributes for one or more packages of the client . For instance package manager can perform a hash function such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 SHA1 or other hash function versions and or other encoding algorithms on attributes such as the package name package epoch package timestamp package size a checksum value a package release identifier and or other data. In embodiments the inventory of the set of installed packages can also be stored or formatted in an unencoded format.

In embodiments and as also shown in the one or more package servers receiving the inventory of the set of installed packages from the client can accept that data and use it to build an aggregate package population record . In aspects the aggregate package population record can be stored or recorded in the one or more repositories which may be associated with the one or more package servers and or can be stored or partially stored in the one or more package servers themselves such as in local hard disk or electronic memory on the one or more package servers . The aggregate package population record can reflect or incorporate the inventory of the set of installed packages received from various clients or other machines and enumerate or identify all packages present or reported on all machines within a network under management. In aspects an administrator or other user can then access the aggregate package population record to analyze and manage the package complement and related resources across an entire network or group of machines for instance to perform updates and or other maintenance or management on clients grouped or characterized according to their package profile. In aspects a set of stored package updates are stored in the one or more repositories . The administrator or other user can thereby select arrange group classify and otherwise manage any arbitrary group or collections of groups of clients within the network under management as related by package commonality or compatibility.

As illustrated for example more particularly in package manager can connect to one or more remote platforms and communicate the inventory of the set of installed packages to facilitate remote package network management and or other operations or services on one or more clients of managed network . In aspects the managed network can comprise or contain a set of clients and or other machines nodes systems or platforms. For instance package manager and or other logic hosted or installed in each client or other machines can access one or more package servers and or one or more repository to initiate package management and update operations on client including to receive a set of package update files tailored to the set of installed packages on each client .

According to aspects the one or more package servers can further execute inventory and machine grouping operations on the managed network including to identify and develop a set of package subsets arbitrarily selected or identified from the aggregate package population record . In aspects as shown the one or more package servers can host or execute an inventory engine and or other logic to collect the aggregate package population record and specify the set of package subsets for use in analyzing managing and or updating sets of clients contained in the managed network . In embodiments the inventory engine and or other logic can develop records related to the package complement and package groupings populating the managed network including the aggregate package population record a package subset enumeration table which lists or identifies all package subsets selected or identified from the aggregate package population record a machine package association table which can associate one or more clients located in managed network with one or more package subsets and the set of stored package updates . By building groupings of clients that are keyed on package subset commonality an administrator or other user can discover locate group and manage arbitrary subsets of clients in the managed network based on their package characteristics. The one or more package servers can access the machine package association table for instance to generate access or identify and set of package update files for each group of clients that contain one or more common subsets identified in the package subset enumeration table . The grouping of machines that contain one or more of the package subset enumeration table can be encoded or stored in the machine package association table to permit machines having common subsets for instance to undergo updating or maintenance on a common basis. Machines hosting a package subset related to email or other messaging can all receive a common update to the hosted email client and or other package updates as all or part of the set of package update files . All machines hosting a firewall or other security application can for instance receive an updated version to a firewall application or service as all or part of the set of package update files . Other groupings of clients based on selected or identified package subsets can be used. It may be noted that in embodiments information stored or generated by the one or more package servers and or associated logic can also be transmitted to one or more remote management platforms such as security storage and or other management platforms or services. The one or more remote management platforms can therefore also or instead carry out operations on the grouped clients of the managed network on a common or centralized basis.

According to aspects the inventory engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can thereby analyze the package complement of the managed network by performing joins and or other operations on the aggregate package population record the machine package association table the package subset enumeration table and or other data or objects illustrated in to discover manage and maintain desired package subsets and associated machine groupings in the managed network . While those records and data are illustrated in those figures it will be understood that other tables databases trees and or other data structures or objects can be used to encode and store data related to the overall package complement of the managed network .

In cases where an encoded representation is used that representation of the inventory of the set of installed packages and or related data can be generated using a hash function operating on text strings or other data reflecting the set of installed packages one or more attributes in set of attributes for the subject packages and or other data. In aspects a hash function or hash operator can be used to generate the encoded representation. When used the hash function can be or include SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm 1 SHA2 Secure Hash Algorithm 2 SHA3 Secure Hash Algorithm 3 and or other hash functions operators or routines. In embodiments the inventory of the set of installed packages and or other data or portions thereof can also or instead can be sent in the clear or in an otherwise unencoded format.

In the inventory of the set of installed packages of the one or more client that has collected package data can be received in the one or more package servers in the remote management platform and or other platform or destination. In the one or more package servers and or other logic can build the aggregate package population record . In aspects the aggregate package population record can be generated and or stored in the one or more repositories associated with the one or more package servers and or in other storage or locations. In aspects the aggregate package population record can reflect the entire population of packages contained or hosted in all clients and or other machines populating the managed network . In aspects the aggregate package population record can be encoded or configured as a table a relational or other database a tree and or other data structure or format. In aspects the aggregate package population record can also or instead be stored in a distributed fashion with components of that data being hosted or recorded in different local or remote databases or other data hosting resources.

In the inventory engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can generate an encoded identification of the aggregate package population record or the constituent data of that record as appropriate. In the inventor engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can receive access extract and or generate the set of package subsets for instance via user input supplied through a selector tool or other interface. In aspects the set of package subsets can also or instead be supplied or received through an automated source such as an application database and or service that generates the set of package subsets on a selective basis.

In the inventory engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can generate the set of subset ID numbers and the package subset enumeration table based on the set of package subsets . In the inventory engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can generate the machine package association table and or other data records or output to encode and store relationships between the clients populating the managed network and set of package subsets that are distributed throughout the managed network.

In aspects the machine package association table can relate group and or associate clients and or other machines according to the individual packages they may share in the set of package subsets . In aspects machines can be grouped or associated based on a single list or set of common package subsets and or can be grouped or associated based on multiple subsets in the set of package subsets . In aspects the ability to specify an arbitrary set of package subsets and organize the clients and or other machines or platforms in the managed network can allow an administrator or other user to usefully link compare and or maintain diverse groups of machine on a centralized basis and in aspects can permit the user to discover previously unknown relationships between the machines populating the managed network . As aspects the aggregate package population record the set of package subsets and other data can also or instead be transmitted to the one or more remote management platforms for instance to carry out security database messaging and or other operations on grouped machines in the managed network . In embodiments the machine package association table and or other data can be stored to the one or more repositories associated with the one or more package servers and or to other local or remote storage.

In the one or more package servers and or other logic can generate and or distribute the set of package updates and or other data or configuration commands to clients of the managed network based on the set of package subsets and or other bases or criteria. The one or more package servers the one or more management platforms and or other logic or platforms can also or instead perform other management actions on the subject client or other machines organized or configured based on the set of package subsets and or other bases or criteria. In the inventory engine of the one or more package servers and or other logic can update the aggregate package population record the machine package association table and or other data related to the package complement of the managed network as appropriate.

For example update operations can be initiated based on a predetermined schedule such as once or week or once a month to interrogate the managed network and discover recently added or recently deleted clients and or other machines. For further example update activity can be triggered by the detection of a new client and or other machine that has registered to the managed network or can be initiated based on other events or criteria. In processing can return to a prior processing point jump to a further processing point or end.

The foregoing description is illustrative and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example while embodiments have been described in which a unitary package manager operating on client is configured to control package management and client identification activity in embodiments multiple local and or remote applications or software can interact to control the downloading installation testing and other management of software packages and the generation of the inventory of the set of installed packages and associated data.

For further example while embodiments have been described in which a group of one or more package servers and or associated one or more package repositories capture and generate the aggregate package population record the package subset enumeration table and other records related to the package population of the managed network in embodiments multiple groups or sets of package servers and or repositories can perform package aggregation subset generation management and other activity. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined. The scope of the present teachings is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims.
