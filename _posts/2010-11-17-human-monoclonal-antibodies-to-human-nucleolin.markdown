This application is a national phase application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT US2010 057046 filed Nov. 17 2010 which claims benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 261 909 filed Nov. 17 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with the support of the United States government under grant number NCI CA109254 04S1 awarded by the National Cancer Institute National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government may have rights in this invention.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of cell biology and immunology. More particularly it concerns methods and compositions relating to the production and use of human monoclonal antibodies to human nucleolin NCL .

Antibodies are a class of agents known as biologicals. The source of antibodies can be a polyclonal supply such as human or horse serum or derived from a monoclonal source single cell clone . With the technologic capability to control and select for specific antigen binding monoclonal antibodies have yielded dramatic therapeutic benefits. However the difficulty of generating specific antibodies for certain targets has limited the successes and the potential for therapeutic and diagnostic agents remains largely untapped.

One impediment to the development of monoclonal antibodies for human therapy is the need to humanize such antibodies which are generally made in mice rats and rabbits. If human patients are administered such antibodies without humanized constant regions they can suffer from serum sickness meaning that an endogenous immune response is mounted by the recipient against the non human antibody sequences. Humanizing monoclonal antibodies produced in research animals can avoid this problem. However the cost in time and expense for humanization of antibodies can be considerable.

Nucleolin is expressed on the cell surface of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL cells acute myeloid leukemia AML cells some forms of breast carcinoma as well as other tumors. As such nucleolin constitutes a promising tumor antigen for targeting of therapeutics including antibodies.

The ability of nucleolin to perform numerous and diverse functions within the cell is related to the multiple structural domains within the protein. Its negatively charged N terminal domain regulates rDNA transcription by inducing nucleolar chromatin decondensation Srivastava et al. 1989 while the central globular domain contains four RNA binding domains RBDs Serin et al. 1997 . It has been proposed that nucleolin via binding of its RBD and its RGG rich C terminal domains to pre ribosomal RNA functions as an assembly factor by bringing together the correctly folded rRNA and other components necessary for rRNA maturation and ribosome assembly Ginisty et al. 2001 . Nucleolin may also be involved in exporting ribosomes to the cytoplasm while shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus Srivastava and Pollard 1999 . The nucleolin gene coding and protein sequences are listed in Table 1.

Human NCL gene consists of 14 exons with 13 introns and spans approximately 11 kb. The nucleolin protein contains several functional domains that mediate its functions. The N terminal part contains multiple phosphorylation sites and is rich in acidic amino acids. The central part of nucleolin includes four RNA binding domains RBD and the C terminal part contains glycine and arginine rich domain termed RGG or GAR domain . Farin et al. 2009 

In one embodiment a region of nucleolin containing the RNA binding domain is used for generation of an isolated human anti nucleolin antibody. In one embodiment a region of nucleolin lacking residues 1 283 SEQ ID NO 4 is used for generation of an isolated human anti nucleolin antibody. In one embodiment the invention provides for an human anti nucleolin antibody that specifically targets a RNA domain containing portion of nucleolin. In one embodiment the invention provides for an isolated human anti nucleolin monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a RNA domain containing portion of nucleolin. In one embodiment the invention provides for an isolated human anti nucleolin monoclonal antibody produced by a human B cell that specifically targets a RNA domain containing portion of nucleolin. In one embodiment the interaction of a human anti nucleolin antibody with nucleolin disrupts interactions of the nucleolin RNA domain with other molecules. In one embodiment the interaction of a human anti nucleolin antibody with nucleolin disrupts interactions of the nucleolin RNA domain with BCL 2.

A considerable body of evidence supports a role for nucleolin in mRNA stabilization. Nucleolin binds to the 3 untranslated region 3 UTR of amyloid precursor protein mRNA and stabilizes this mRNA Westmark and Malter 2001 . It is also required for the stabilization of IL 2 mRNA that occurs during T cell activation Chen et al. 2000 . More recent studies have demonstrated that nucleolin binds to an A U rich element ARE in the 3 UTR of bcl 2 mRNA in HL 60 cells Sengupta et al. 2004 chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL cells Otake et al. 2007 and MCF 7 breast cancer cells Soundararajan et al. 2008 . Binding of nucleolin to the bcl 2 ARE stabilizes bcl 2 mRNA by protecting it from ribonuclease degradation while shRNA knockdown of nucleolin in MCF 7 cells leads to bcl 2 mRNA instability and decreased levels of bcl 2 protein Soundararajan et al. 2008 .

Nucleolin is present on the external surface of various types of tumor cells Otake et al. 2007 Soundararajan et al. 2008 Chen et al. 2008 Hovanessian et al. 2000 Sinclair and O Brien 2002 despite its lack of a transmembrane domain or signal sequence Srivastava et al. 1989 Lapeyre et al. 1987 . Results show that nucleolin is not secreted from either MV4 11 cells or K 562 cells into the tissue culture medium Soundararajan et al. 2009 . This suggests that the presence of nucleolin on the cell surface is not the result of adsorption of secreted nucleolin by macromolecules on the cell surface of tumor cells. However nucleolin undergoes extensive posttranslational modification Srivastava et al. 1989 Lapeyre et al. 1987 . It has been isolated as a glyco phospho protein from the surface of various types of proliferating cells Hovanessian et al. 2000 Pfeifle and Anderer 1983 . It is also possible that palmitoylation prenylation or myristoylation of nucleolin may allow for insertion or anchoring of these hydrophobic regions of the protein into the plasma membrane. It is thought that nucleolin functions as a shuttling protein between the plasma membrane and nucleus Hovanessian et al. 2000 . In proliferating tumor cells nucleolin is often associated with endocytotic vesicles that invaginate from the plasma membrane Hovanessian et al. 2000 . Nucleolin also acts as a cell surface receptor for various ligands since ligands bound to nucleolin within these vesicles become internalized in a temperature dependent process. For example plasma membrane nucleolin has been reported to function as a receptor for intimin of Sinclair and O Brien 2002 the anti HIV agent midkine Said et al. 2002 laminin 1 Kibbey et al. 1995 DNA nanoparticles Chen et al. 2008 and the anti angiogenic pseudopeptide HB 19 Destouches et al. 2008 . Nucleolin is an important protein in the nucleolus involved in ribosome biogenesis and maturation in exponentially growing eukaryotic cells. In this regard one important function of nucleolin is as a shuttling protein between cytoplasm and nucleus involving RNA processing and other cell biological process. While in normal cellular physiology nucleolin is localized predominantly in the nucleolus and cytoplasm under certain conditions especially in various disease states it has also been shown to be present in a phosphorylated form on the cell surface. In this regard nucleolin in the cell membrane serves as a binding protein for a variety of ligands that drive cell proliferation differentiation adhesion mitogenesis and angiogenesis.

Several lines of evidence suggest that nucleolin is an excellent tumor antigen for antibody based immunotherapy. Nucleolin is overexpressed in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm a variety of human tumors including human chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL Otake et al. 2007 acute myeloid leukemia AML Soundararajan et al. 2008 and breast cancer cells Soundararajan et al. 2008 but not in normal CD19 B cells Otake et al. 2007 CD33 myeloid cells Gattoni Celli et al. 2009 nor in normal mammary epithelial cells Soundararajan et al. 2008 . It is of interest that AML blast cells from patients that engraft in NOD SCID mice show intense nucleolin staining in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm while the normal mouse bone marrow cells and spleen lymphocytes were negative for nucleolin Gattoni Celli et al. 2009 .

The nucleolin targeting aptamer AS1411 targets human nucleolin. Plasma membrane nucleolin was recently reported to be a receptor for AS1411 in human MV4 11 leukemia cells Soundararajan et al. 2009 .

AS1411 binds to nucleolin that is overexpressed on the external surface of tumor cells and gains intracellular access when nucleolin is shuttled from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus. AS1411 has been shown to exhibit antiproliferative activity in a broad set of cancer cell lines that over express nucleolin Table 2 .

In another embodiment the anti nucleolin antibody fragment has improved affinity to human nucleolin as the parent antibody.

Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab .sub.2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab .sub.2 fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is a minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen binding site. In one embodiment a two chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv scFv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment contains the heavy and light chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab .sub.2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see e.g. Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York 1994 pp. 269 315.

The term diabodies refers to antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 1993 01161 Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. PNAS USA 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9 129 134 2003 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations can be advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein Nature 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. Hybridoma 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al.

The modifier polyclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a source of a nonhomogeneous population of antibodies. A polyclonal antibody comprises more than one antibody such as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 antibodies.

The monoclonal antibodies herein include human non human humanized and chimeric antibodies. Chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. PNAS USA 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 1991 Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. J. Immunol. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. PNAS USA 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

The following are descriptions of the general procedures for obtaining a human monoclonal antibody against nucleolin. These procedures are exemplary and can be modified while retaining the essential aspects of the invention.

To prepare B cells from tonsils tonsil tissue is mixed with an antibiotic chopped and minced to approximately 1 mmpieces followed by gentle grinding of tonsil pieces and straining through a nylon strainer. The suspension is then centrifuged on a Ficoll cushion. The boundary layer containing mononuclear cells is extracted washed and re suspended in DPBS. Further enrichment 95 can be achieved by negative selection using antibodies and magnetic beads

Non human mammalian chimeric polyclonal e.g. sera and or monoclonal antibodies Mabs and fragments e.g. proteolytic digestion or fusion protein products thereof are potential therapeutic agents are often used in an attempt to treat certain diseases. However such antibodies or fragments can elicit an immune response when administered to humans. Such an immune response can result in an immune complex mediated clearance of the antibodies or fragments from the circulation and make repeated administration unsuitable for therapy thereby reducing the therapeutic benefit to the patient and limiting the readministration of the antibody or fragment. For example repeated administration of antibodies or fragments comprising non human portions can lead to serum sickness and or anaphalaxis. In order to avoid these and other problems a number of approaches have been taken to reduce the immunogenicity of such antibodies and portions thereof including chimerization and humanization. These and other approaches however still can result in antibodies or fragments having some immunogenicity low affinity low avidity or with problems in cell culture scale up production and or low yields. Thus such antibodies or fragments can be less than ideally suited for manufacture or use as therapeutic proteins. Thus an antibody expressed from human cells can avoid many of these issues and be substantially non immunogenic to a human. Immunogenic as used herein refers to possessing the ability to elicit an immune response.

In one embodiment a human anti nucleolin antibody expressed by a human B cell is substantially non immunogenic a human. In one embodiment an isolated human anti nucleolin monoclonal antibody expressed by a human B cell is substantially non immunogenic a human.

To prepare B cells from peripheral blood venous blood is drawn into syringes containing heparin sodium to prevent coagulation diluted and centrifuged on a Ficoll cushion. The boundary layer containing mononuclear cells is extracted washed and re suspended in DPBS. Further enrichment can be achieved as stated above.

For infection by inoculation with EBV supernatant B cells are resuspended at 10to 10cells per ml in complete RPMI media and mixed with an equal volume of filtered EBV supernatant then incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. and 5 CO. The culture volume can be adjusted by the addition of complete RPMI media such that infected cells were resuspended for cell culture at a desired concentration generally 10to 10cells per ml . Cells are then dispensed into multi well plates and transferred to a tissue culture incubator at 37 C. and 5 CO.

For spin fection B cells are resuspended at 10to 10cells per ml in complete RPMI media and mixed with an equal volume of 10 fold ultrafiltration concentrated EBV and placed in a well of a 6 well tissue culture plate. The plate is then centrifuged at 900 g for 1 hr at ambient temperature at which time infected cells are re suspended in complete RPMI media at a desired concentration generally 10to 10cells per ml dispensed into multi well plates and transferred to a tissue culture incubator at 37 C. and 5 CO.

Optionally B cells may be contacted with Toll Like Receptor TLR ligands at the time of or subsequent to the infection. The ligands may be added at the following final concentrations Pam3CSK4 0.1 1 g ml Zymosan 1 10 g ml poly I C 1 25 g ml LPS 1 5 g ml Imiquimod 1 g ml and or CpG 1 10 g ml .

Infectivity varies based upon route of infection. Infection of tonsil B cells by inoculation with EBV supernatant results in immortalization of approximately 1 5 of B cells. Addition of TLR ligands approximately doubles infection efficiency. Infection of tonsil B cells by spin fection with concentrated virus increases infection efficiency to virtually 100 after 24 hours.

To induce B cell differentiation immunoglobulin isotype class switching and or IgG secretion cytokines and other signaling agents are added to EBV infected B cells immediately after infection 16 to 20 hr after infection and or sequentially at weekly intervals 2 3 4 or 5 times . Agents may be diluted in media and added to cells at the following final concentrations recombinant human interleukins IL IL 4 0.2 ng ml IL 5 0.2 ng ml IL 6 0.1 ng ml IL 9 0.2 ng ml IL 10 0.24 ng ml IL 13 1 ng ml recombinant human interferon 2a IFN 2a 2 000 IU ml recombinant human BAFF 1 ng ml recombinant human soluble CD40L 5 ng ml goat anti human IgM F ab 1.4 g ml amounts are approximate . Particular combinations comprise anti IgM F ab CD40L BAFF anti IgM F ab IL 6 BAFF anti IgM F ab CD40L IL 6 BAFF anti IgM F ab CD40L IL 6 IL4 and anti IgM F ab CD40L and IL 9 IL 13.

The initiation of immunoglobulin isotype class switching can be detected as early as 5 days following exposure to the cytokine growth factor signaling agent cocktail and the process continues for the following 10 days.

Following exposure to the cytokine growth factor signaling agent cocktail culture supernatants are collected about once a week or at days 10 20 post infection from immortalized tonsil and blood B cell cultures pooled and tested using an ELISA or other screening format such as dot blot or flow cytometry Western blotting or inhibition promotion of functional activity. Antigen may be bound directly or through capture antibodies onto the wells of a polystyrene e.g. 96 well plate and allowed to bind e.g. overnight. Plates are then washed blocked and contacted with immortalized B cell culture supernatant samples or controls in triplicate or other replicates. Subsequently the plate is washed extensively and then e.g. alkaline phosphatase AP coupled goat anti human IgG or other labeled secondary antibody is added for detection of bound IgG by e.g. AP conversion of colorimetric substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt.

Based upon the discussion above immunoglobulin isotype class switching and or IgG secretion starts immediately after and can be detected as early as 5 days following exposure to the cytokine growth factor signaling agent cocktail. IgG levels increase in the supernatant over the next 10 days. Thus from about 7 21 days about 10 21 days about 7 10 days or about 10 14 days or at 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 or 21 days one will select B cells that have undergone immunoglobulin isotype class switching and secrete IgG.

Various methods can be employed for the cloning and expression of human immunoglobulin light and heavy chain sequences. Weltschof et al. 1995 incorporated herein by reference describes in detail the methods used by the inventors. The variable regions or variable constant regions can be cloned.

Other techniques such as those described by Takekoshi et al. 2001 are also useful. In that reference total cellular RNA was isolated from pelleted cells using a commercial kit RNeasy mini kit Qiagen . Using random 9 mers nucleotides and reverse transcriptase Takara RNA PCR kit Ohtsu cDNAs were synthesized and were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction PCR with heavy and light chain primers specific for human immunoglobulins Ig . A touchdown PCR protocol was employed i.e. three cycles each of denaturation at 95 C. for 1 min annealing for 1 min and elongation at 72 C. for 2 min for a total of 11 cycles. The annealing temperature was varied from 65 55 C. in steps of 1 C. The touchdown cycles were followed by 25 cycles using an annealing temperature of 55 C. The resultant PCR product was gel purified in agarose and extracted using Qiaquick spin columns Qiagen . The light chain and heavy chain Fc genes were then cloned into the NheI AscI and the SfiI NotI sites of the expression vector pFab1 His2. The ligated pFab1 His2 vectors with the light chain and and Fc heavy chain genes and were introduced into competent JM109 cells Toyobo Osaka . After transformation the cells were plated onto Luria Bertani LB ampicillin 50 g ml plates. Isolated bacterial colonies were incubated at 30 C. in 2 ml of Super Broth SB with ampicillin 50 g ml and MgCl 1.5 mM . Isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside IPTG was used to induce production of the Fab protein. Cells from the bacterial cultures were pelleted resuspended in 0.3 ml of B PER Pierce with a protease inhibitor cocktail Complete Boehringer Mannheim and shaken for 5 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15 000 G for 10 min and the resultant supernatant containing the Fab antibody portion was collected.

Once cloned the nucleic acids for the human light and heavy chains can be inserted into appropriate expression vectors and transferred into host cells e.g. antibody producing cells that support production of antibodies. Particular cell lines contemplated for production are 293 cells CHO cells COS cells or various forms of myeloma cells some lacking IgG. These cells can be exploited for human MAb production in two basic ways. First myelomas or immortalized cells can be injected often into the peritoneal cavity into a histocompatible animal of the type that was used to provide the somatic and myeloma cells for the original fusion e.g. a syngeneic mouse or into an immunodeficient animal for injection of noncompatible cells. Optionally the animals are primed with a hydrocarbon especially oils such as pristane tetramethylpcntadecane prior to injection. The injected animal develops tumors secreting the specific monoclonal antibody produced by the transfected myeloma. The body fluids of the animal such as serum or ascites fluid can then be tapped to provide human MAbs in high concentration. Second the individual cell lines could be cultured in vitro where the human MAbs are naturally secreted into the culture medium from which they can be readily obtained in high concentrations.

Human MAbs produced by either means can be further purified if desired using filtration centrifugation and various chromatographic methods such as HPLC or affinity chromatography. Fragments of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be obtained from the monoclonal antibodies so produced by methods which include digestion with enzymes such as pepsin or papain and or by cleavage of disulfide bonds by chemical reduction.

In one embodiment a human anti nucleolin antibody is produced from an immortalized human B cell. In one embodiment a human anti nucleolin antibody is produced using a method such as one set forth in PCT US2008 072124 or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 671 936 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment the cDNA of an isolated human anti nucleolin antibody may be produced by cloning cDNA or genomic DNA encoding the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the anti nucleolin antibody from a hybridoma cell by fusing a specific antibody producing B cell with a myeloma that produces an antibody homolog according to this invention. In one embodiment an isolated human anti nucleoline antibody is produced by a human B cell. In one embodiment a cell is transfected by one or more polynucleotide sequences isolated from a human B cell where the polynucleotide sequence encodes for human anti nucleolin antibody. The cDNA or genomic DNA encoding the polypeptides can be inserted into expression vectors so that both genes are operatively linked to their own transcriptional and translational expression control sequences. The expression vector and expression control sequences can then be chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. Typically both genes are inserted into the same expression vector.

Prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells can be used as expression hosts. Expression in eukaryotic host cells is preferred because such cells are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody. However any antibody produced that is inactive due to improper folding may be renaturable according to well known methods Kim and Baldwin 1982 . It is possible that the host cells will produce portions of intact antibodies such as light chain dimers or heavy chain dimers which also are antibody homologs according to the present invention.

It will be understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment a host cell is transformed with DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain but not both of an antibody homolog of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some or all of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for nucleolin binding. The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are antibody homologs according to this invention. In one embodiment bifunctional antibodies are produced in which one heavy and one light chain are homologs of a human anti nucleolin antibody and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than nucleolin or another epitope of nucleolin.

In one embodiment DNA encoding an isolated human anti nucleolin antibody is transferred to a preferred mammalian cell line for expression in production or commercial amounts. It has long been recognized that Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO cells make excellent expression vehicles for recombinant or non endogenous DNA. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567. There has been developed a series of DHFR deficient CHO cell strains which permit the amplification of inserted DNA encoding specific proteins or DNA sequences as set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 981 214. Examples of additional mammalian cell lines for expression in production or commercial amounts include but are not limited to 293HEK cells HeLa cells COS cells NIH3T3 cells Jurkat Cells. NSO cells and HUVEC cells. Other mammalian cell lines suitable for the expression of recombinant proteins have been identified in the literature and can be equally suitable for use in the invention of this application.

In one embodiment the anti nucleolin antibody of the invention comprises a modified amino acid sequence compared to wild type. For example it can be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the anti nucleolin antibodies are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the anti nucleolin antibody chains or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the anti nucleolin antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post translational processes of the anti nucleolin antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the anti nucleolin antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells Science 1989 . Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed anti nucleolin antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intra sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an anti nucleolin antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the anti nucleolin antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the anti nucleolin antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the anti nucleolin antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 1 hydrophobic norleucine met ala val leu ile 2 neutral hydrophilic cys ser thr 3 acidic asp glu 4 basic asn gln his lys arg 5 residues that influence chain orientation gly pro and 6 aromatic trp tyr phe.

Non conservative substitutions may also be done and entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antagonist also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the antagonist to improve its stability particularly where the anti nucleolin antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A type of substitution variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitution variants is affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. antagonist activity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or in addition it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and nucleolin. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

In one embodiment the anti nucleolin antibody is modified to have altered glycosylation compared to wild type antibody. Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions Jefferis and Lund 1997 Wright and Morrison 1997 . The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein s function Boyd et al. 1996 Wittwe and Howard 1990 and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three dimensional surface of the glycoprotein Jefferis and Lund 1996 . Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. For example it has been reported that in agalactosylated IgG the oligosaccharide moiety flips out of the inter CH2 space and terminal N acetylglucosamine residues become available to bind mannose binding protein Malhotra et al. 1995 . Removal by glycopeptidase of the oligosaccharides from CAMPATH 1H a recombinant humanized murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody which recognizes the CDw52 antigen of human lymphocytes produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells resulted in a complete reduction in complement mediated lysis CMCL Boyd et al. 1996 while selective removal of sialic acid residues using neuraminidase resulted in no loss of DMCL. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . In particular CHO cells with tetracycline regulated expression of 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc was reported to have improved ADCC activity Umana et al. 1999 .

Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Glycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody changing the composition of glycosylation glycosylation pattern the extent of glycosylation etc.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites . Similarly removal of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by amino acid alteration within the native glycosylation sites of the antibody.

The amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti nucleolin antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the anti nucleolin antibody.

The glycosylation including glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering the amino acid sequence or the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins e.g. antibodies as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell significant variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected see e.g. Hse et al. 1997 . In addition to the choice of host cells factors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode media formulation culture density oxygenation pH purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 047 335 5 510 261 and 5 278 299 . Glycosylation or certain types of glycosylation can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein for example using endoglycosidase H Endo H . In addition the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered e.g. make defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.

The glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis including lectin chromatography NMR Mass spectrometry HPLC GPC monosaccharide compositional analysis sequential enzymatic digestion and HPAEC PAD which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known and include without limitation enzymatic treatment commonly performed using peptide N glycosidase F endo galactosidase elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O linked structures and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N and O linked oligosaccharides.

In one embodiment an anti nucleolin antibody is formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 1985 Hwang et al. 1980 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent such as Doxorubicin is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 1989 .

In one embodiment an anti nucleolin antibody is used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO 81 01145 to an active drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278.

The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active form exhibiting the desired biological properties.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a desired cell population.

The enzymes can be covalently bound to the anti nucleolin antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 1984 .

In one embodiment of the invention an anti nucleolin antibody comprises an antibody fragment rather than an intact antibody. In this case the antibody fragment may be modified in order to increase its serum half life. This may be achieved for example by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment e.g. by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle e.g. by DNA or peptide synthesis . See WO 96 32478 published Oct. 17 1996.

The salvage receptor binding epitope generally constitutes a region wherein any one or more amino acid residues from one or two loops of a Fc domain are transferred to an analogous position of the antibody fragment. Even more preferably three or more residues from one or two loops of the Fc domain are transferred. Still more preferred the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fe region e.g. of an IgG and transferred to the CH1 CH3 or Vregion or more than one such region of the antibody. Alternatively the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region and transferred to the Cregion or Vregion or both of the antibody fragment.

In one embodiment an anti nucleolin antibody is modified by covalent linkages. Covalent linkages may include but are not limited to by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody. Other types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues. Exemplary covalent modifications of polypeptides are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 534 615 specifically incorporated herein by reference. One type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 640 835 4 496 689 4 301 144 4 670 417 4 791 192 or 4 179 337.

In another embodiment an anti nucleolin antibody such as a human antibody is modified by fusing or conjugating it to another heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence.

In one embodiment an human anti nucleolin antibody is modified to comprise targeted immunoconjugate moieties which enable the effective generation of innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors or pathogens. In one embodiment an isolated human anti nucleolin monoclonal antibody is modified to comprise targeted immunoconjugate moieties which enable the effective generation of innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors or pathogens. In one embodiment an isolated human anti nucleolin monoclonal antibody produced by a human B cell is modified to comprise targeted immunoconjugate moieties which enable the effective generation of innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors or pathogens. The immunoconjugates can be capable of simultaneously satisfying multiple key requirements for mounting effective antibody and or cell mediated immune responses against the targeted tumor or pathogen which include but are not limited to i Inducing or augmenting uptake and cross presentation of tumor or pathogen antigen s or antigenic determinant s by antigen presenting cells APC dendritic cells DC ii promoting the maturation of dendritic cells DCs in the target cell milieu iii providing CD4 T cell help to generate CD8 T cell memory and antibodies against the tumor or pathogen iv sensitizing the targeted tumor cell to antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity ADCC and T cell mediated death. Such immunoconjugated antibodies can be used for targeted immunotherapy or immunoprophylaxis of neoplastic diseases infectious diseases and other disorders. For example pattern recognition receptors PRRs such as Toll Like Receptors recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns PAMPs expressed by diverse infectious microorganisms bacteria fungi protozoa viruses and molecules released by damaged host tissues damage associated molecular patterns alarmins . The addition of a PAMP conjugated to a isolated human anti nucleolin antibody provides a moiety comprising a nucleic acid or protein that is recognized by a PRR ultimately leading to an immune response which eliminates the target cell with the anti nucleolin antibody bound to it. Examples of PAMPS that can be conjugated to an anti nucleolin antibody include but are limited to known viral and pathogenic epitopes such as polyinosine polycytidylic acid lipopolysaccharide LPS lipid A flagellin GU rich short single stranded RNA unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides.

In one embodiment an anti nucleolin antibody such as a human antibody is fused or conjugated with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag can be placed at the amino or carboxyl terminus of the anti nucleolin antibody. The presence of such epitope tagged forms of an anti nucleolin antibody can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also provision of the epitope tag enables the anti nucleolin antibody to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. A non limiting summary of example epitope tags that may be fused to an anti nucleolin antibody of the invention is listed in Table 3. Examples include poly histidine poly his or poly histidine glycine poly his gly tags the flu HA tag and its antibody 12CA5 Field et al. 1988 the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4 B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. 1985 and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et at 1990 . Other tag polypeptides include the Flag peptide Hopp et al. 1988 the KT3 epitope peptide Martin et al. 1992 an tubulin epitope peptide Skinner et al. 1991 and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag Lutz Freyermuth et al. 1990 .

In one embodiment detectable labels are used in a therapeutic and or diagnostic application using an anti nucleolin antibody. Detectable labels are compounds and or elements that permit detection of bound antibody. Many appropriate imaging agents are known in the art as are methods for their attachment to antibodies see for e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 021 236 4 938 948 and 4 472 509 each incorporated herein by reference . The imaging moieties used can be paramagnetic ions radioactive isotopes fluorochromes NMR detectable substances X ray imaging agents. Other agents include enzymes haptens fluorescent labels phosphorescent molecules chemilluminescent molecules chromophores photoaffinity molecules colored particles or ligands such as biotin.

In one aspect the detectable labels comprise paramagnetic ions. Examples of paramagnetic ions include but are not limited to chromium III manganese II iron iron II cobalt II nickel II copper II neodymium III samarium III ytterbium III gadolinium III vanadium II terbium III dysprosium III holmium III and or erbium III with gadolinium being particularly preferred. Ions useful in other contexts such as X ray imaging include but are not limited to lanthanum III gold III lead II and bismuth III . In one aspect the detectable lables comprise radioactive isotopes. Examples of radioactive isotope include but are not limited to antimony antimony arsenic astatine barium barium beryllium bismuth bismuth cadmium cadmium calcium carbon cerium cerium cerium cesium chromium chlorine cobalt cobalt cobalt cobalt copper erbium eurpium gallium gadolinium gold gold hafnium hafnium hafnium hydrogen iodine iodine iodine indium iridium iron iron krypton lead lutecium manganese mercury mercury molybdenum neodynium neptunium nickel niobium osmium palladium phosphorus platinum praseodymium promethium protactinium radium rhenium rhenium rubidium ruthenium ruthenium scandium scandium selenium selenium silver silver sodium strontium strontium strontium sulphur tantalum technicium tellurium tellurium terbium thallium thorium thorium thullium tin titanium tungsten vanadlum vanadium yttrium yttrium yttrium ytterbium zinc and zirconium.

In one embodiment Iodine techniciumand or indiumare used due to their low energy and suitability for long range detection. Radioactively labeled monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be produced according to well known methods in the art. For instance monoclonal antibodies can be iodinated by contact with sodium and or potassium iodide and a chemical oxidizing agent such as sodium hypochlorite or an enzymatic oxidizing agent such as lactoperoxidase. Monoclonal antibodies according to the invention can be labeled with technetiumby ligand exchange process for example by reducing pertechnate with stannous solution chelating the reduced technetium onto a Sephadex column and applying the antibody to this column. Alternatively direct labeling techniques can be used e.g. by incubating pertechnate a reducing agent such as SNCl a buffer solution such as sodium potassium phthalate solution and the antibody. Intermediary functional groups which are often used to bind radioisotopes which exist as metallic ions to antibody are diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA or ethylene diaminetetracetic acid EDTA .

In one embodiment a detectable label comprises a fluorescent label. Examples of fluorescent labels include but are not limited to Alexa 350 Alexa 430 AMCA BODIPY 630 650 BODIPY 650 665 BODIPY FL BODIPY R6G BODIPY TMR BODIPY TRX Cascade Blue Cy3 Cy5 6 FAM Fluorescein Isothiocyanate HEX 6 JOE Oregon Green 488 Oregon Green 500 Oregon Green 514 Pacific Blue REG Rhodamine Green Rhodamine Red Renographin ROX TAMRA TET Tetramethylrhodamine and or Texas Red.

Another type of antibody conjugates contemplated in the present invention are those intended primarily for use in vitro where the antibody is linked to a secondary binding ligand and or to an enzyme an enzyme tag that will generate a colored product upon contact with a chromogenic substrate. Examples of suitable enzymes include but are not limited to urease alkaline phosphatase horseradish hydrogen peroxidase or glucose oxidase. Particular secondary binding ligands are biotin and or avidin and streptavidin compounds. The use of such labels is well known to those of skill in the art and are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 817 837 3 850 752 3 939 350 3 996 345 4 277 437 4 275 149 and 4 366 241 each incorporated herein by reference.

Yet another known method of site specific attachment of molecules to antibodies comprises the reaction of antibodies with hapten based affinity labels. Essentially hapten based affinity labels react with amino acids in the antigen binding site thereby destroying this site and blocking specific antigen reaction. However this can not be advantageous since it results in loss of antigen binding by the antibody conjugate.

Molecules containing azido groups can also be used to form covalent bonds to proteins through reactive nitrene intermediates that are generated by low intensity ultraviolet light Potter and Haley 1983 . In particular 2 and 8 azido analogues of purine nucleotides have been used as site directed photoprobes to identify nucleotide binding proteins in crude cell extracts Owens Haley 1987 Atherton et al. 1985 . The 2 and 8 azido nucleotides have also been used to map nucleotide binding domains of purified proteins Khatoon et al. 1989 King et al. 1989 Dholakia et al. 1989 and can be used as antibody binding agents.

Several methods are known in the art for the attachment or conjugation of an antibody to its conjugate moiety. Some attachment methods involve the use of a metal chelate complex employing for example an organic chelating agent such a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid anhydride DTPA ethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid N chloro p toluenesulfonamide and or tetrachloro 3 6 diphenylglycouril 3 attached to the antibody U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 472 509 and 4 938 948 . Monoclonal antibodies can also be reacted with an enzyme in the presence of a coupling agent such as glutaraldehyde or periodate. Conjugates with fluorescein markers are prepared in the presence of these coupling agents or by reaction with an isothiocyanate. In U.S. Pat. No. 4 938 948 imaging of breast tumors is achieved using monoclonal antibodies and the detectable imaging moieties are bound to the antibody using linkers such as methyl p hydroxybenzimidate or N succinimidyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate.

In other embodiments derivatization of immunoglobulins by selectively introducing sulfhydryl groups in the Fc region of an immunoglobulin using reaction conditions that do not alter the antibody combining site are contemplated. Antibody conjugates produced according to this methodology are disclosed to exhibit improved longevity specificity and sensitivity U.S. Pat. No. 5 196 066 incorporated herein by reference . Site specific attachment of effector or reporter molecules wherein the reporter or effector molecule is conjugated to a carbohydrate residue in the Fc region have also been disclosed in the literature O Shannessy et al. 1987 . This approach has been reported to produce diagnostically and therapeutically promising antibodies which are currently in clinical evaluation.

It is envisioned that for administration to a subject in need thereof a antibody will be suspended in a formulation suitable for administration to a host. In one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment the monoclonal antibody is an anti nucleolin antibody. In one embodiment the monoclonal anti nucleolin antibody is a human monoclonal anti nucleolin antibody. Aqueous compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of an antibody dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation and or aqueous medium. The phrases pharmaceutically and or pharmacologically acceptable refer to compositions that do not produce an adverse allergic and or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal and specifically to humans as appropriate.

As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and or antifungal agents isotonic and or absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media or agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. For administration to humans preparations should meet sterility pyrogenicity general safety and or purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.

In one embodiment a human anti nucleolin antibody of the invention can be administered in any sterile biocompatible pharmaceutical carrier including but not limited to saline buffered saline dextrose and water. Any of these molecules can be administered to a patient alone or in combination with other agents drugs or hormones in pharmaceutical compositions where it is mixed with suitable excipient s adjuvants and or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In one embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is pharmaceutically inert.

Administration of pharmaceutical compositions is accomplished orally or parenterally. Methods of parenteral delivery include topical intra arterial e.g. directly to a tumor intramuscular subcutaneous intramedullary intrathecal intraventricular intravenous intraperitoneal or intranasal administration. In addition to the active ingredients these pharmaceutical compositions can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and other compounds that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Further details on techniques for formulation and administration may be found in the latest edition of Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Maack Publishing Co Easton Pa. .

Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets pills dragees capsules liquids gels syrups slurries suspensions etc. suitable for ingestion by the patient. See PCT publication WO 93 23572.

Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use may be obtained through combination of active compounds with solid excipient optionally grinding a resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable additional compounds if desired to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are carbohydrate or protein fillers include but are not limited to sugars including lactose sucrose mannitol or sorbitol starch from corn wheat rice potato or other plants cellulose such as methyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or sodium carboxymethylcellulose and gums including arabic and tragacanth as well as proteins such as gelatin and collagen. If desired disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added such as the cross linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone agar alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.

Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings such as concentrated sugar solutions which may also contain gum arabic talc polyvinylpyrrolidone carbopol gel polyethylene glycol and or titanium dioxide lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound i.e. dosage .

Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push fit capsules made of gelatin as well as soft sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push fit capsules can contain active ingredients mixed with a filler or binders such as lactose or starches lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids such as fatty oils liquid paraffin or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers.

Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of active compounds. For injection the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank s solution Ringer s solution or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol or dextran. Additionally suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil or synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides or liposomes. Optionally the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.

For topical or nasal administration penetrants appropriate to the particular barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner similar to that known in the art e.g. by means of conventional mixing dissolving granulating dragee making levigating emulsifying encapsulating entrapping or lyophilizing processes .

The pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a salt and can be formed with many acids including but not limited to those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents that are the corresponding free base forms. In other cases the preparation may be a lyophilized powder in 1 mM 50 mM histidine 0.1 2 sucrose 2 7 mannitol at a pH range of 4.5 to 5.5 that is combined with buffer prior to use.

The carrier can also be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial ad antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

After pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in an acceptable carrier have been prepared they can be placed in an appropriate container and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. For administration of human telomerase proteins and nucleic acids such labeling would include amount frequency and method of administration.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to achieve the intended purpose. Therapeutically effective amount or pharmacologically effective amount are well recognized phrases and refer to that amount of an agent effective to produce the intended pharmacological result. Thus a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease being treated. One useful assay in ascertaining an effective amount for a given application e.g. a therapeutically effective amount is measuring the effect on cell survival. The amount actually administered will be dependent upon the individual to which treatment is to be applied and will preferably be an optimized amount such that the desired effect is achieved without significant side effects.

For any compound the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in any appropriate animal model. The animal model is also used to achieve a desirable concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.

In an animal a therapeutically effective amount is the quantity of compound which results in an improved clinical outcome as a result of the treatment compared with a typical clinical outcome in the absence of the treatment. An improved clinical outcome refers for example to a longer life expectancy fewer complications fewer symptoms less physical discomfort and or fewer hospitalizations as a result of the treatment. Improved clinical outcome can be quantified as a certain percent of subjects receiving administration and improving in their disease state over certain period of time. The certain percent of subjects receiving administration and improving in their disease state may be about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 . The certain percent of subjects receiving administration and improving in their disease state may be about 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 or 85 . The certain percent of subjects receiving administration and improving in their disease state may be about 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 . The certain period of time to measure improved clinical outcome may be 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 days. The certain period of time to measure improved clinical outcome may be 1 2 3 or 4 weeks. The certain period of time to measure improved clinical outcome may be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more years.

With respect to cancer an improved clinical outcome includes a longer life expectancy. It can also include slowing or arresting the rate of growth of a tumor causing a shrinkage in the size of the tumor a decreased rate of metastasis or an improved quality of life e.g. a decrease in physical discomfort or an increase in mobility .

With respect to modulation of the immune system an improved clinical outcome refers to an increase in the magnitude of the immune response in the individual if the individual has a disease involving immune suppression. An improved clinical outcome for individuals with suppressed immune systems can also refer to a lesser susceptibility to infectious diseases. For diseases involving an overactive immune system an improved clinical outcome can refer to a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response. In both cases an improved clinical outcome can also involve an improvement in the quality of life as described above.

A therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount of protein polypeptide peptide antibody oligo or polynucleotide agonist or antagonists which ameliorates the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population and LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population . The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio ED LDPharmaceutical compositions which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies is used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed sensitivity of the patient and the route of administration.

The exact dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient to be treated. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active moiety or to maintain the desired effect. Additional factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state e.g. tumor size and location age weight and gender of the patient diet time and frequency of administration drug combination s reaction sensitivities and tolerance response to therapy . Administration may be every day every other day every week every other week every month every other month or any variation thereof. Administration of a dosage form comprising a human anti nucleolin antibody may be for at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 days. Administration of a dosage form comprising a human anti nucleolin antibody may be for at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 weeks. Administration of a dosage form comprising a human anti nucleolin antibody may be for at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 months. Administration of a dosage form comprising a human anti nucleolin antibody may be for at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 years. Administration of one or more agents e.g. a human anti nucleolin antibody and an other agent can be intermittent for example administration can be once every two days every three days every five days once a week once or twice a month and the like. Long acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days every week or once every two weeks depending on half life and clearance rate of the particular formulation. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 657 760 5 206 344 and 5 225 212 herein incorporated by reference . In one embodiment the dosage of a composition comprising human anti nucleolin antibody is administered to a patient is about 0.1 mg kg to 500 mg kg of the patient s body weight. The amount forms and or amounts of the different forms can be varied at different times of administration. In one embodiment a human anti nucleolin antibody is administered to a subject.

Acute myeloid leukemia AML also known as acute myelogenous leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults and its incidence increases with age. Although AML is a relatively rare disease accounting for approximately 1.2 of cancer deaths in the United States its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages.

The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells which causes a drop in red blood cells platelets and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue shortness of breath easy bruising and bleeding and increased risk of infection. Although several risk factors for AML have been identified the specific cause of the disease remains unclear. As an acute leukemia AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.

AML has several subtypes treatment and prognosis varies among subtypes. Five year survival varies from 5 70 and relapse rate varies from 30 95 depending on subtype. AML is treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission patients can go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML has developed tests that better predict how long a patient is likely to survive and whether a drug is likely to be effective.

The first symptom leading to a diagnosis of AML is typically non specific related to one or more of the cytopenias e.g. anemia neutropenia and or thrombocytopenia. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells leukocytosis with immature blood cells blasts in the peripheral blood are a common finding and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets red blood cells or even with a low white blood cell count leukopenia . While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made via examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts a definitive diagnosis usually requires an examination of the cells taken from a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

Marrow or blood is examined via light microscopy as well as flow cytometry to diagnose the presence of leukemia to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia and to classify the subtype of disease see below . A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for various chromosomal aberrations by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies can also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3 nucleophosmin and bcr able among others which can influence the outcome of the disease.

Cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinction of AML from ALL and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a non specific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing from ALL. The non specific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.

The diagnosis and classification of AML can be challenging and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases the presence of certain morphologic features such as Auer rods or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias however in the absence of such features diagnosis can be more difficult.

According to the widely used WHO criteria the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20 of the blood and or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts. AML must be carefully differentiated from pre leukemic conditions such as myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes which are treated differently.

Because acute promyelocytic leukemia APL has the highest curability and requires a unique form of treatment it is important to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia. Fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose as it readily identifies the chromosomal translocation t 15 17 that characterizes APL.

The malignant cell in AML is the myeloblast. In normal hematopoiesis the myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. However in AML a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which freeze the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation. Such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia however when such a differentiation arrest is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells leading to the clinical entity of AML.

Much of the diversity and heterogeneity of AML stems from the fact that leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway. Modern classification schemes for AML recognize that the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell and the leukemia can depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted.

Specific cytogenetic abnormalities can be found in many patients with AML the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance. The chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins usually transcription factors whose altered properties can cause the differentiation arrest. For example in acute promyelocytic leukemia the t 15 17 translocation produces a PML RAR fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.

The clinical signs and symptoms of AML result from the fact that as the leukemic clone of cells grows it tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia anemia and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are in turn often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases patients can develop a chloroma or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.

Treatment of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy and is divided into two phases induction and postremission or consolidation therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the amount of leukemic cells to an undetectable level the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure.

All FAB subtypes except M3 are usually given induction chemotherapy with cytarabine ara C and an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin . This induction chemotherapy regimen is known as 7 3 or 3 7 because the cytarabine is given as a continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an IV push. Up to 70 of patients will achieve a remission with this protocol. Other alternative induction regimens including high dose cytarabine alone or investigational agents can also be used. Because of the toxic effects of therapy including myelosuppression and an increased risk of infection induction chemotherapy can not be offered to the very elderly and the options can include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care.

The M3 subtype of AML also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia is almost universally treated with the drug ATRA all trans retinoic acid in addition to induction chemotherapy. Care must be taken to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable with well documented treatment protocols.

The goal of the induction phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission does not mean that the disease has been cured rather it signifies that no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50 75 of newly diagnosed adults although this can vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.

Even after complete remission is achieved leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further post remission or consolidation therapy is given almost all patients will eventually relapse. Therefore more therapy is necessary to eliminate non detectable disease and prevent relapse that is to achieve a cure.

The specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a patient s prognostic factors see above and general health. For good prognosis leukemias i.e. inv 16 t 8 21 and t 15 17 patients will typically undergo an additional 3 5 courses of intensive chemotherapy known as consolidation chemotherapy. For patients at high risk of relapse e.g. those with high risk cytogenetics underlying MDS or therapy related AML allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the patient is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate risk AML normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good risk or high risk groups is less clear and depends on the specific situation including the age and overall health of the patient the patient s personal values and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.

Despite aggressive therapy however only 20 30 of patients enjoy long term disease free survival. For patients with relapsed AML the only proven potentially curative therapy is a stem cell transplant if one has not already been performed. In 2000 the monoclonal antibody linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin Mylotarg was approved in the United States for patients aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy.

Patients with relapsed AML who are not candidates for stem cell transplantion or who have relapsed after a stem cell transplant can be offered treatment in a clinical trial as conventional treatment options are limited. Agents under investigation include cytotoxic drugs such as clofarabine as well as targeted therapies such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors decitabine and inhibitors of MDR1 multidrug resistance protein . Since treatment options for relapsed AML are so limited another option which can be offered is palliative care.

For relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia APL arsenic trioxide has been tested in trials and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Like ATRA arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of AML.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a curable disease the chance of cure for a specific patient depends on a number of prognostic factors. The single most important prognostic factor in AML is cytogenetics or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes for example the t 15 17 translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia . About half of AML patients have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment.

AML which arises from a pre existing myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease so called secondary AML has a worse prognosis as does treatment related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy. Both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities.

In some studies age 60 years and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level were also associated with poorer outcomes. As with most forms of cancer performance status i.e. the general physical condition and activity level of the patient plays a major role in prognosis as well.

FLT3 internal tandem duplications ITDs have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in AML. Treating these patients with more aggressive therapy such as stem cell transplantation in first remission has not been shown to enhance long term survival so this prognostic feature is of uncertain clinical significance at this point. ITDs of FLT3 can be associated with leukostasis.

Researchers are investigating the clinical significance of c KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent and clinically relevant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c KIT pharmacologically. Other genes being investigated as prognostic factors or therapeutic targets include CEBPA BAALC ERG and NPM1.

Cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 20 45 however it should be noted that clinical trials often include only younger patients and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies. The overall cure rate for all patients with AML including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy is likely lower. Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as 98 .

B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B CLL also known as chronic lymphoid leukemia CLL is the most common type of leukemia. Leukemias are abnormal and malignant neoplastic proliferations of the white blood cells leukocytes . CLL involves a particular subtype of white blood cells which is a lymphocyte called a B cell. B cells originate in the bone marrow develop in the lymph nodes and normally fight infection. In CLL the DNA of a B cell is damaged so that it can t fight infection by producing antibodies. Additionally they grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow and blood where they crowd out healthy blood cells.

CLL is a disease of adults but in rare cases it can occur in teenagers and occasionally in children inherited . Most 75 people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 50 and the majority are men. Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count but as it advances CLL results in swollen lymph nodes spleen and liver and eventually anemia and infections. Early CLL is not treated and late CLL is treated with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies. Survival varies from 5 years to more than 25 years. It is now possible to predict survival length more precisely by examining the DNA mutations patients with slowly progressing disease can be reassured and can not need any treatment in their lifetimes.

Although not originally appreciated CLL is now felt to be identical to a disease called small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL a type of non Hodgkin s lymphoma which presents primarily in the lymph nodes. The World Health Organization considers CLL and SLL to be one disease at different stages not two separate entities.

Staging determining the extent of the disease is done with the Rai staging system or the Binet classification and is based primarily on the presence or not of a low platelet or red cell count. Early stage disease does not need to be treated.

Recent publications suggest that two or three prognostic groups of CLL exist based on the maturational state of the cell. This distinction is based on the maturity of the lymphocytes as discerned by the immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain IgV gene mutation status. High risk patients have an immature cell pattern with few mutations in the DNA in the IgVantibody gene region whereas low risk patients show considerable mutations of the DNA in the antibody gene region indicating mature lymphocytes.

Since assessment of the IgVantibody DNA changes is difficult to perform the presence of either cluster of differentiation 38 CD38 or Z chain associated protein kinase 70 ZAP 70 can be surrogate markers of high risk subtype of CLL. Their expression correlates with a more immature cellular state and a more rapid disease course.

In addition to the maturational state the prognosis of patients with CLL is dependent on the genetic changes within the neoplastic cell population. These genetic changes can be identified by fluorescent probes to chromosomal parts using a technique referred to as fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH . Four main genetic aberrations are recognized in CLL cells that have a major impact on disease behavior.

Deletions of part of the short arm of chromosome 17 del 17p which target the cell cycle regulating protein p53 are particularly deleterious. Patients with this abnormality have significantly short interval before they require therapy and a shorter survival. This abnormality is found in 5 10 of patients with CLL. Deletions of the long arm on chromosome 11 del 11q are also unfavorable although not to the degree seen with del 17p. The abnormality targets the ATM gene and occurs infrequently in CLL 5 10 . Trisomy 12 an additional chromosome 12 is a relatively frequent finding occurring in 20 25 of patients and imparts an intermediate prognosis. Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 del 13q is the most common abnormality in CLL with roughly 50 of patients with cells containing this defect. These patients have the best prognosis and most will live many years even decades without the need for therapy. The gene targeted by this deletion is a segment that likely produces small inhibitory RNA molecules that affect expression of important death inhibiting gene products.

Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count. Uncommonly CLL presents as enlargement of the lymph nodes without a high white blood cell count or no evidence of the disease in the blood. This is referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma. In some individuals the disease comes to light only after the neoplastic cells overwhelm the bone marrow resulting in anemia producing tiredness or weakness.

The disease is easily diagnosed. CLL is usually first suspected by the presence of a lymphocytosis an increase in one type of the white blood cell on a complete blood count CBC test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 4000 cells per mm microliter of blood but can be much higher. The presence of a lymphocytosis in an elderly individual should raise strong suspicion for CLL and a confirmatory diagnostic test in particular flow cytometry should be performed unless clinically unnecessary.

The diagnosis of CLL is based on the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood bone marrow or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. This atypical molecular pattern includes the co expression of cells surface markers cluster of differentiation 5 CD5 and cluster of differentiation 23 CD23 . In addition all the CLL cells within one individual are clonal that is genetically identical. In practice this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive antibody light chains kappa or lambda on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody producing cells resulting in a mixture of both kappa and lambda expressing cells. The lack of the normal distribution of kappa and lambda producing B cells is one basis for demonstrating clonality the key element for establishing a diagnosis of any B cell malignancy B cell Non Hodgkin s lymphoma .

The combination of the microscopic examination of the peripheral blood and analysis of the lymphocytes by flow cytometry to confirm clonality and marker molecule expression is needed to establish the diagnosis of CLL. Both are easily accomplished on a small amount of blood. A flow cytometer is an instrument that can examine the expression of molecules on individual cells in fluids. This requires the use of specific antibodies to marker molecules with fluorescent tags recognized by the instrument. In CLL the lymphocytes are genetically clonal of the B cell lineage express marker molecules cluster of differentiation 19 CD19 and CD20 and characteristically express the marker molecules CD5 and CD23. Morphologically the cells resemble normal lymphocytes under the microscope although slightly smaller and are fragile when smeared onto a glass slide giving rise to many broken cells smudge cells .

CLL treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure. CLL is treated by chemotherapy radiation therapy biological therapy or bone marrow transplantation. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically splenectomy removal of enlarged spleen or by radiation therapy de bulking swollen lymph nodes .

Initial CLL treatments vary depending on the exact diagnosis and the progression of the disease and even with the preference and experience of the health care practitioner. There are dozens of agents used for CLL therapy and there is considerable research activity studying them individually or in combination with each other.

While generally considered incurable CLL progresses slowly in most cases. Many people with CLL lead normal and active lives for many years in some cases for decades. Because of its slow onset early stage CLL is generally not treated since it is believed that early CLL intervention does not improve survival time or quality of life. Instead the condition is monitored over time to detect any change in the disease pattern.

The decision to start CLL treatment is taken when the patient s clinical symptoms or blood counts indicate that the disease has progressed to a point where it can affect the patient s quality of life. Determining when to start treatment and by what means is often difficult studies have shown there is no survival advantage to treating the disease too early. The National Cancer Institute Working Group has issued guidelines for treatment with specific markers that should be met before it is initiated.

Although the purine analogue fludarabine was shown to give superior response rates than chlorambucil as primary therapy there is no evidence that early use of fludarabine improves overall survival and some clinicians prefer to reserve fludarabine for relapsed disease. Mab therapies include alemtuzumab directed against CD52 and rituximab directed against CD20 .

Combination chemotherapy options are effective in both newly diagnosed and relapsed CLL. Recently randomized trials have shown that combinations of purine analogues fludarabine with alkylating agents cyclophosphamide produce higher response rates and a longer progression free survival than single agents 

Allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation is rarely used as a first line treatment for CLL due to its risk. There is increasing interest in the use of reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation which offers the prospect of cure for selected patients with a suitable donor.

Current research is comparing different forms of bone marrow transplants to determine which patients are the best candidates and which approach is best in different situations. Younger patients that are at high risk for dying from CLL might consider hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT . Autologous stem cell transplantation a lower risk form of treatment using the patient s own blood cells is not curative. Myeloablative bone marrow killing forms of allogeneic stem cell transplantation a high risk treatment using blood cells from a healthy donor can be curative for some patients but most patients cannot tolerate the treatment. An intermediate level called reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be better tolerated by older or frail patients.

 Refractory CLL is a disease that no longer responds favorably to treatment. In this case more aggressive therapies including lenalidomide flavopiridol and bone marrow stem cell transplantation are considered. The monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab directed against CD52 can be used in patients with refractory bone marrow based disease.

Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in the breast usually in the inner lining of the milk ducts or lobules. There are different types of breast cancer with different stages spread aggressiveness and genetic makeup. With best treatment 10 year disease free survival varies from 98 to 10 . Treatment is selected from surgery drugs chemotherapy and radiation. In the United States there were 216 000 cases of invasive breast cancer and 40 000 deaths in 2004. Worldwide breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer after lung cancer 10.4 of all cancer incidence both sexes counted and the fifth most common cause of cancer death. In 2004 breast cancer caused 519 000 deaths worldwide 7 of cancer deaths almost 1 of all deaths . Breast cancer is about 100 times as frequent among women as among men but survival rates are equal in both sexes.

The first symptom or subjective sign of breast cancer is typically a lump that feels different from the surrounding breast tissue. According to the The Merck Manual more than 80 of breast cancer cases are discovered when the woman feels a lump. According to the American Cancer Society the first medical sign or objective indication of breast cancer as detected by a physician is discovered by mammogram. Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits can also indicate breast cancer. Indications of breast cancer other than a lump can include changes in breast size or shape skin dimpling nipple inversion or spontaneous single nipple discharge. Pain mastodynia is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer but can be indicative of other breast health issues.

When breast cancer cells invade the dermal lymphatics small lymph vessels in the skin of the breast its presentation can resemble skin inflammation and thus is known as inflammatory breast cancer IBC . Symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include pain swelling warmth and redness throughout the breast as well as an orange peel texture to the skin referred to as peau d orange. Another reported symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget s disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as eczematoid skin changes such as redness and mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget s advances symptoms can include tingling itching increased sensitivity burning and pain. There can also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget s also have a lump in the breast.

Occasionally breast cancer presents as metastatic disease that is cancer that has spread beyond the original organ. Metastatic breast cancer will cause symptoms that depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone liver lung and brain. Unexplained weight loss can occasionally herald an occult breast cancer as can symptoms of fevers or chills. Bone or joint pains can sometimes be manifestations of metastatic breast cancer as can jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are non specific meaning they can also be manifestations of many other illnesses.

The primary risk factors that have been identified are sex age childbearing hormones a high fat diet alcohol intake obesity and environmental factors such as tobacco use radiation and shiftwork. No etiology is known for 95 of breast cancer cases while approximately 5 of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes. In particular carriers of the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are at a 30 40 increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer depending on in which portion of the protein the mutation occurs. Experts believe that 95 of inherited breast cancer can be traced to one of these two genes. Hereditary breast cancers can take the form of a site specific hereditary breast cancer cancers affecting the breast only or breast ovarian and other cancer syndromes. Breast cancer can be inherited both from female and male relatives.

Breast cancer subtypes are categorized on an immunohistochemical basis. Subtype definitions are generally as follows 

In the case of triple negative breast cancer cells the cancer s growth is not driven by estrogen or progesterone or by growth signals coming from the HER2 protein. By the same token such cancer cells do not respond to hormonal therapy such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors or therapies that target HER2 receptors such as Herceptin . About 10 20 of breast cancers are found to be triple negative. It is important to identify these types of cancer to that one can avoid costly and toxic effects of therapies that are unlike to succeed and to focus on treatments that can be used to treat triple negative breast cancer. Like other forms of breast cancer triple negative breast cancer can be treated with surgery radiation therapy and or chemotherapy. One particularly promising approach is neoadjuvant therapy where chemo and or radiotherapy is provided prior to surgery. Another new drug therapy is the use of poly ADP ribose polymerase or PARP inhibitors.

While screening techniques discussed above are useful in determining the possibility of cancer a further testing is necessary to confirm whether a lump detected on screening is cancer as opposed to a benign alternative such as a simple cyst. In a clinical setting breast cancer is commonly diagnosed using a triple test of clinical breast examination breast examination by a trained medical practitioner mammography and fine needle aspiration cytology. Both mammography and clinical breast exam also used for screening can indicate an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer and can also identify any other lesions. Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology FNAC which can be done in a GP s office using local anaesthetic if required involves attempting to extract a small portion of fluid from the lump. Clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous but bloody fluid can be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together these three tools can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy. Other options for biopsy include core biopsy where a section of the breast lump is removed and an excisional biopsy where the entire lump is removed.

Breast cancer screening is an attempt to find cancer in otherwise healthy individuals. The most common screening method for women is a combination of x ray mammography and clinical breast exam. In women at higher than normal risk such as those with a strong family history of cancer additional tools can include genetic testing or breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Breast self examination was a form of screening that was heavily advocated in the past but has since fallen into disfavour since several large studies have shown that it does not have a survival benefit for women and often causes considerably anxiety. This is thought to be because cancers that could be detected tended to be at a relatively advanced stage already whereas other methods push to identify the cancer at an earlier stage where curative treatment is more often possible.

X ray mammography uses x rays to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps. Regular mammograms is recommended in several countries in women over a certain age as a screening tool.

Genetic testing for breast cancer typically involves testing for mutations in the BRCA genes. This is not generally a recommended technique except for those at elevated risk for breast cancer.

The mainstay of breast cancer treatment is surgery when the tumor is localized with possible adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor chemotherapy and or radiotherapy. At present the treatment recommendations after surgery adjuvant therapy follow a pattern. Depending on clinical criteria age type of cancer size metastasis patients are roughly divided to high risk and low risk cases with each risk category following different rules for therapy. Treatment possibilities include radiation therapy chemotherapy hormone therapy and immune therapy.

Targeted cancer therapies are treatments that target specific characteristics of cancer cells such as a protein that allows the cancer cells to grow in a rapid or abnormal way. Targeted therapies are generally less likely than chemotherapy to harm normal healthy cells. Some targeted therapies are antibodies that work like the antibodies made naturally by our immune systems. These types of targeted therapies are sometimes called immune targeted therapies.

There are currently 3 targeted therapies doctors use to treat breast cancer. Herceptin trastuzumab works against HER2 positive breast cancers by blocking the ability of the cancer cells to receive chemical signals that tell the cells to grow. Tykerb lapatinib works against HER2 positive breast cancers by blocking certain proteins that can cause uncontrolled cell growth. Avastin bevacizumab works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels that cancer cells depend on to grow and function.

Hormonal anti estrogen therapy works against hormone receptor positive breast cancer in two ways first by lowering the amount of the hormone estrogen in the body and second by blocking the action of estrogen in the body. Most of the estrogen in women s bodies is made by the ovaries. Estrogen makes hormone receptor positive breast cancers grow. So reducing the amount of estrogen or blocking its action can help shrink hormone receptor positive breast cancers and reduce the risk of hormone receptor positive breast cancers coming back recurring . Hormonal therapy medicines are not effective against hormone receptor negative breast cancers. There are several types of hormonal therapy medicines including aromatase inhibitors selective estrogen receptor modulators and estrogen receptor downregulators. In some cases the ovaries and fallopian tubes can be surgically removed to treat hormone receptor positive breast cancer or as a preventive measure for women at very high risk of breast cancer. The ovaries also can be shut down temporarily using medication.

In planning treatment doctors can also use PCR tests like Oncotype DX or microarray tests that predict breast cancer recurrence risk based on gene expression. In February 2007 the first breast cancer predictor test won formal approval from the Food and Drug Administration. This is a new gene test to help predict whether women with early stage breast cancer will relapse in 5 or 10 years this could help influence how aggressively the initial tumor is treated.

Radiation therapy is also used to help destroy cancer cells that can linger after surgery. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50 66 when delivered in the correct dose.

Tumor cell resistance to single agents represents a major problem in clinical oncology. One goal of current cancer research is to find ways to improve the efficacy of existing therapies. One way is by combining therapies in what is known as combination therapy. In one embodiment the present invention provides a combination therapy wherein an anti nucleolin antibody and at least one other agent comprise a composition for use in contacting a target cell. In one aspect the combination of anti nucleolin antibody and at least one other agent are used in a combined amount effective to kill or inhibit proliferation of the cell.

In one embodiment the method further comprises can contacting the cells with a human anti nucleolin antibody and one or more additional agent s or factor s . In one embodiment the method further comprises contacting the cell with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents or by contacting the cell with two distinct compositions or formulations at the same time wherein one composition includes the anti nucleolin antibody and the other includes the agent.

In another embodiment the method comprises contact by the anti nucleolin antibody before or after contact by the other agent by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the other agent and anti nucleolin antibody are applied separately to the cell one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery such that the agent and anti nucleolin antibody would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell. In such instances it is contemplated that one would contact the cell with both modalities within about 12 24 hours of each other and more preferably within about 6 12 hours of each other with a delay time of only about 12 hours being most preferred. In some situations it can be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly however where several days 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 to several weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 lapse between the respective administrations.

In another embodiment the method comprises more than one administration of either the anti nucleolin antibody or the other agent. Combinations of the anti nucleolin antibody or the other agent include where the anti nucleolin antibody is A and the other agent is B as exemplified below 

Agents or factors suitable for use in a combined therapy are any chemical compound or treatment method that induces DNA damage when applied to a cell. In particular such agents are those discussed in Section VI C i iii above. In treating cancer according to the invention one would contact the tumor cells with an agent in addition to the anti nucleolin antibody. This can be achieved by irradiating the localized tumor site with radiation or administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a chemotherapeutic compound.

A variety of chemical compounds also described as chemotherapeutic agents function to induce DNA damage all of which are intended to be of use in the combined treatment methods disclosed herein. In one embodiment the other agents comprise chemotherapeutic agents. Categories of chemotherapeutic agents of the invention include but are not limited to alkylating agents anthracyclines cytoskeletal disruptors epothilones inhibitors of topoisomerase II nucleotide analogs and precursor analogs peptide antibiotics platinum based agents retinoids or vinca alkaloids and derivatives. Specific chemotherapeutic agents within these groups include but are not limited to actinomycin D all trans retinoic acid azacitidine adriamycin azathioprine bleomycin camptothecin carboplatin capecitabine cisplatin chlorambucil cyclophosphamide cytarabine daunorubicin docetaxel doxifluridine doxorubicin epirubicin epothilone etoposide fluorouracil 5 fluorouracil 5FU gemcitabine hydroxyurea hydrogen peroxide idarubicin imatinib mechlorethamine mercaptopurine methotrexate mitomycin C mitoxantrone oxaliplatin paclitaxel pemetrexed teniposide tioguanine valrubicin vinblastine vincristine vindesine vinorelbine. The invention also encompasses the use of a combination of one or more DNA damaging agents whether radiation based or actual compounds such as the use of X rays with cisplatin or the use of cisplatin with etoposide.

Agents that directly cross link nucleic acids specifically DNA are envisaged to facilitate DNA damage leading to a synergistic antineoplastic combination with anti nucleolin antibody. Agents such as cisplatin and other DNA alkylating agents can be used. Cisplatin has been widely used to treat cancer with efficacious doses used in clinical applications of 20 mg mfor 5 days every three weeks for a total of three courses. Cisplatin is not absorbed orally and must therefore be delivered via injection intravenously subcutaneously intratumorally or intraperitoneally.

Agents that damage DNA also include compounds that interfere with DNA replication mitosis and chromosomal segregation. Such chemotherapeutic compounds include adriamycin also known as doxorubicin etoposide verapamil podophyllotoxin and the like. Widely used in a clinical setting for the treatment of neoplasms these compounds are administered through bolus injections intravenously at doses ranging from 25 75 mg mat 21 day intervals for adriamycin to 35 50 mg mfor etoposide intravenously or double the intravenous dose orally.

Agents that disrupt the synthesis and fidelity of nucleic acid precursors and subunits also lead to DNA damage. As such a number of nucleic acid precursors have been developed. Particularly useful are agents that have undergone extensive testing and are readily available. As such agents such as 5 fluorouracil 5 FU are preferentially used by neoplastic tissue making this agent particularly useful for targeting to neoplastic cells. Although quite toxic 5 FU is applicable in a wide range of carriers including topical however intravenous administration with doses ranging from 3 to 15 mg kg day being commonly used.

Other factors that cause DNA damage and have been used extensively include what are commonly known as rays X rays and or the directed delivery of radioisotopes to tumor cells. Other forms of DNA damaging factors are also contemplated such as microwaves and UV irradiation. It is most likely that all of these factors effect a broad range of damage DNA on the precursors of DNA the replication and repair of DNA and the assembly and maintenance of chromosomes. Dosage ranges for X rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time 3 to 4 weeks to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely and depend on the half life of the isotope the strength and type of radiation emitted and the uptake by the neoplastic cells.

B cells were resuspended at 10to 10cells ml in complete RPMI media and were mixed with an equal volume or up to two volumes of 10 concentrated EBV or were resuspended directly in 10 concentrated EBV stocks at 2 10up to 2 10cells per ml and placed in wells of a 6 well tissue culture plate Greiner bio one cat. 65760 . Concentration of EBV stocks more than 10 resulted in decreased infection efficiencies. The plate was then centrifuged at 900 G for 1 2 hours at ambient temperature at which time infected cells were re suspended in complete RPMI media or complete RPMI media containing cytokines and signaling agents for induction of differentiation at a desired concentration generally 10to 10cells per ml . Infected cells were dispensed into multi well plates and transferred to a tissue culture incubator at 37 C. and 5 CO. For generation of immortalized B cell libraries generally 10cells were resuspended in 200 ml of media containing cytokines and signaling agents and plated into ten round bottom 96 well plates 10cells per 200 L per well .

B cells were infected with B95 8 strain EBV as described above with the addition of Toll Like Receptor TLR ligands at the time of the infection. The ligands were added at the following final concentrations lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 0.5 g ml zymosan 1 g ml polyinosine polycitadylic acid poly I C 25 g ml lipopolysaccharide LPS 5 g ml Imiquimod 1 g ml unmethylated CpG DNA 1 g ml .

At 12 hours post infection B cells were counted and dispensed into wells of 96 well round bottom plates Greiner cat 650180 as a 2 fold dilution series with each consecutive row of wells containing half the number of cells found in the previous row. The initial rows contained 50 000 cells per well and final rows in the dilution series contained 24 cells per well. Cells were incubated for 9 days in a tissue culture incubator at 37 C. and 5 CO at which point lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth was visible by microscopy. Immortalization efficiency was estimated based upon the assumption that lymphoblastoid cell proliferation resulted from EBV immortalization of at least one B cell in the well. Thus the efficiency was calculated from rows containing wells with the lowest number of cells per well in which lymphoblastoid cell proliferation was consistently observed by microscopy and expressed as 1 immortalization event per number of cells originally dispensed into the well.

analysis was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur instrument at the MUSC Flow Cytometry Facility according to established methods.

Nucleolin and Bcl 2 Protein are Overexpressed in the Plasma Membrane And Cytoplasm of B CLL Cells Compared to B Cells from Normal Human Volunteers.

CLL is indolent during most of its clinical course and the clonal B cells accumulate in the bone marrow and circulation during the indolent phase by avoiding apoptosis Klein et al. 2000 . CLL cells circumvent apoptosis by over expressing the anti apoptotic protein Bcl 2. High level expression of bcl 2 mRNA and protein is seen in the absence of gene rearrangements that are known to enhance bcl 2 transcription Bakhshi et al. 1985 Robertson et al. 1996 Steube et al. 1995 . One of the inventors discovered that bcl 2 mRNA is highly stabilized in CLL cells from patients compared to normal CD19 B cells from healthy volunteers Otake et al. 2007 . In addition the inventors showed that the enhanced stability of bcl 2 mRNA in CLL cells was a direct result of binding of the stabilizing protein nucleolin to an ARE element in the 3 UTR of bcl 2 mRNA. Furthermore nucleolin was over expressed in the cytoplasm of CLL cells from all of the patients examined .

Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 17 patients with untreated CLL and 9 healthy volunteers. Mononuclear cells were isolated from each blood sample and the B cells were purified from this fraction by immuno magnetic separation using positive selection for CD19 a pan B cell marker. The cytosolic levels of nucleolin and Bcl 2 protein were then compared in CD19 CLL cells from the patients to the levels in CD19 B cells from the healthy volunteers Otake et al. 2007 . Cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin were examined because that is postulated to be the site of stabilization of bcl 2 mRNA. The non nuclear cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin and Bcl 2 protein were determined by immunoblots of S10 extracts. To accurately compare the immuno blot results from different patients the integrated density values IDV of the nucleolin and Bcl 2 protein bands in the immunoblots were normalized to the IDV values obtained from known amounts of nucleolin and Bcl 2 external standards. This analysis revealed that Bcl 2 levels were 11 fold elevated p

Nucleolin and Bcl 2 Protein are Overexpressed in the Plasma Membrane and Cytoplasm of B CLL Cells Compared to B Cells from Normal Human Volunteers.

Confocal microscopy studies of CLL cells from patients and B cells from healthy volunteers were performed to confirm the results obtained by immuno blotting. The localization of nucleolin was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using anti nucleolin MAb and a FITC anti mouse IgG secondary antibody. The DNA was stained with propidium iodide. The overlay images in indicate that nucleolin was present in the plasma membrane cytoplasm and nucleus of CLL cells but was only present in the nucleus of B cells. These results were consistent with the immunoblots indicating localization of nucleolin in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of CLL cells but not in normal B cells.

Nucleolin is Also Highly Overexpressed in MCF 7 Breast Cancer Cells Compared to MCF 10A Normal Mammary Epithelial Cells.

The intracellular localization of nucleolin in MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells and MCF 10A normal mammary epithelial cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence as described above Soundararajan et al. 2008 . The overlay images in indicate that nucleolin was present throughout the nucleus plasma membrane and cytoplasm green fluorescence of MCF 7 cells while in normal MCF 10A cells nucleolin was detected only in the nucleus. This was also true for MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells Soundararajan et al. 2008 

Nucleolin and Bcl 2 Protein are Also Overexpressed in the Plasma Membrane and Cytoplasm of MCF 7 and MDA Mb 231 Breast Cancer Cells Compared to MCF 10A Normal Mammary Epithelial Cells.

The intracellular localization of nucleolin was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using primary antibody against nucleolin and a FITC conjugated anti mouse IgG secondary antibody green fluorescence . The DNA was stained with propidium iodide red fluorescence . The overlay images in indicate that nucleolin was present throughout the nucleus yellow fluorescence plasma membrane and cytoplasm green fluorescence of MCF 7 cells while in normal MCF 10A cells nucleolin was detected only in the nucleus. The intracellular localization of nucleolin in MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells Soundararajan et al. 2008 was similar to that of MCF 7 cells.

Further evidence that nucleolin is a tumor specific antigen and also has a role in human AML pathogenesis comes from human AML xenograft studies. Biopsy specimens from the bone marrow were assessed for expression of nucleolin in the blast cytoplasm and or nucleus. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on glass slides of paraffin embedded tissue sections of archived bone marrow biopsies. In all cases the AML blasts were compared to the surrounding normal bone marrow elements. The inventors observed that anti nucleolin staining was intense in the AML blast cells fuchsin stain while normal elements of the bone marrow dark blue counterstain were either weakly positive or outright negative . Strong expression of nucleolin has been observed in all AML samples tested to date.

Ten NOD SCID male mice eleven weeks of age were each injected i.p. with 25 g of anti asialo GM antibody and exposed to 2.3 Gy in a Cs137 irradiator. The same day five of the ten mice were each injected i.p. with 2 10PBMC from a human subject diagnosed with AML. At least 60 of the PBMC in this subject were AML blasts. Four months after the i.p. injection of PBMC all mice were euthanized. In two of five mice injected i.p. with AML cells the spleens were enlarged and showed nodular lesions on the surface of the spleen as well as within it. Part of the spleen of each mouse was processed to dissociate splenocytes and analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of human CD45 cells. In mice with abnormal spleens some of the spleenocytes were stained with anti human CD45 antibodies demonstrating that these mice had been engrafted with human AML cells. The inventors next carried out histopathology and immunohistochemistry analyses on the spleen of engrafted and control NOD SCID mice . Nodular areas of leukemic engraftment in the spleen were strikingly positive for nucleolin expression.

Furthermore nucleolin immunohistochemistry performed on a human breast carcinoma tissue array comprising tumor and normal adjacent breast tissue from 50 patients indicated that nucleolin was overexpressed in the tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue. Representative results are depicted for the most common forms of breast cancer . Nucleolin was highly expressed in invasive ductal carcinoma 8 8 cases tested and medullary carcinoma 6 6 cases and was moderately expressed in mucinous adenocarcinoma 8 8 cases but was not detected in adjacent normal tissue .

The results presented in above provide strong evidence that nucleolin is overexpressed on the cell surface of certain human tumor cells as a tumor specific antigen. For human CLL and possibly AML and breast cancer nucleolin overexpression is an early event in the pathogenesis of this disease. The nucleolin targeting aptamer AS1411 which is considered a chemical anti nucleolin antibody Soundararajan et al. 2008 Soundararajan et al. 2009 showed promising activity in phase II clinical trials for refractory and relapsed AML Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT00512083 . Thus when taken together these results indicate that nucleolin is an excellent target for the development of therapeutic antibodies.

The overexpression of Bcl 2 in CLL cells compared to normal B cells could result either from enhanced bcl 2 mRNA transcription increased bcl 2 mRNA stability or increased efficiency of bcl 2 mRNA translation. It is difficult to measure mRNA stability in primary CLL cells with the standard method using actinomycin D to block transcription since bcl 2 mRNA is very stable in CLL cells requiring long incubation times with actinomycin D which is toxic to the cells. To circumvent this problem the inventors measured the levels of nascent unspliced heterogeneous nuclear bcl 2 mRNA hnRNA and mature bcl 2 mRNA in CLL cells and normal B cells from healthy volunteers. This method has been used successfully to determine the relative rate of mRNA transcription and mRNA decay in a variety of cells. Equal amounts of total RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed and real time PCR was performed with two sets of primers. One reaction contained primers that anneal to the first intron to selectively amplify hnRNA and one with primers that anneal to sequences in two adjacent exons to selectively amplify spliced mature RNA . The inventors found that the ratio of bcl 2 mRNA to bcl 2 hnRNA was about 3 fold higher for CLL cells compared to normal B cells p

The mechanism of bcl 2 mRNA stabilization by nucleolin was examined by following the decay rate of bcl 2 RNA transcripts in extracts prepared from purified CLL cells and normal B cells using an in vitro RNA decay system Sengupta et al. 2004 . Capped and polyadenylated mRNAs were used in these assays to mimic in vivo decay which involves cap stimulated deadenylation by poly A specific ribonuclease PARN followed by rapid decay of the mRNA body by the exosome Chen et al. 2001 Mukherjee et al. 2002 . P labeled bcl 2 ARE transcripts were incubated with cytoplasmic S100 extracts from CLL and normal B cells in the presence of poly A to activate deadenylation. As shown in bcl 2 transcripts decayed more rapidly in extracts of normal B cells than in extracts of CLL cells. The average half life of bcl 2 RNA in cytoplasmic extracts of CLL cells from 4 patients was estimated to be 72 min by extrapolation of the data while the average half life of the transcript in normal B cell extracts was 12 min . The rapid decay of the bcl 2 CR coding region ARE RNA transcripts in normal B cell extracts was highly ARE dependent since the rates of decay of bcl 2 mRNA coding region transcripts lacking the ARE bcl 2 CR RNA were similar in normal B cell and CLL cell extracts. It is also important to note that addition of 280 nM purified recombinant nucleolin 1 283 Nuc His 6 to extracts of normal B cells greatly slowed the decay rate of bcl 2 ARE extrapolated half life of 62 min When taken together these results indicate that nucleolin stabilizes bcl 2 mRNA by binding to an ARE in the 3 UTR of bcl 2 mRNA and protecting the mRNA from degradation.

Cumulatively the preliminary studies described above indicate that nucleolin is a promising tumor antigen target for antibody based immunotherapy of CLL and AML and possibly for certain forms of breast cancer. The inventors therefore set out to create therapeutic human MAbs specific for nucleolin using a novel in vitro method for producing human MAbs from immortalized B cell libraries created from human tonsil. The technology holds several advantages including 1 rapid antibody production with all steps in vitro 2 human immunization is not required 3 the resulting antibodies are fully human and therefore should not be rejected nor cause serum sickness. This technology was invented with support of the National Cancer Institute and the Federal Government has certain rights in the invention. A worldwide patent application PCT US2008 072124 was filed in August 2008. An overview of the technology is depicted in . Human B cells were isolated from tonsillectomy specimens from healthy children then efficiently infected with Epstein Barr virus EBV resulting in wide scale B cell transformation. Infected B cells were induced to differentiate with agents that mimic B cell receptor signaling and T cell help. Since tonsil is a rich source of B cells this process typically allowed for the isolation of 10 10B cells each with unique antibody specificity. The efficient infection process is demonstrated in which shows that after spinfection of tonsil B cells with 10 concentrated viral stocks of recombinant EBV containing a green fluorescent protein marker gene EBfaV GFP Speck et al. 1999a Speck et al. 1999b nearly 100 of the tonsil B cells were infected after 24 h. The infected cells were then plated into 96 well plates at 10 10cells per well in the presence of a proprietary differentiation cocktail Diff Cktl consisting of recombinant CD40L Baff and anti human IgM Fab that induced immunoglobulin Ig isotype class switching from IgM to IgG over a 2 week period. As can be seen in IgG was secreted into the culture supernatant at levels typically ranging from 1 4 g ml. This process reproducibly creates EBV immortalized tonsil B cell libraries secreting polyclonal IgG with an estimated 10 10antibody specificities depending upon the number of B cells isolated from an individual tonsil. Cell culture supernatants from the libraries can then be screened for specific binding to various antigens of interest. B cells producing IgG with the desired specificity can then be isolated by limiting dilution cloning and the IgG purified from the culture supernatant. For larger scale production recombinant IgG can be produced by subcloning the clonal B cells Ig genes into mammalian expression vectors and transducing cell lines commonly used for the production of biologicals. To date the inventors have created more than 40 libraries data not shown which have been screened for reactivity to various antigenic targets.

This platform technology is ideal for producing autoantibodies with therapeutic implications such as antibodies to tumor antigens like nucleolin. Ordinarily healthy children would not be expected to make strong secondary antibody responses to self proteins such as nucleolin because autoreactive B cells do not normally receive sufficient T cell help required for their survival and differentiation into IgG secreting plasma cells. Instead the autoreactive B cells become tolerized or are deleted in vivo. However these data indicate that it is possible to rescue rare nucleolin reactive B cells from tonsil or peripheral blood using EBV to immortalize the autoreactive B cells and the differentiation cocktail to artificially force them to undergo Ig isotype class switching and secretion of nucleolin specific IgG in vitro. Using this approach the inventors screened twelve immortalized tonsil libraries for nucleolin specific IgG by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . As can be seen in six human B cell lines have been isolated that produce IgG antibodies that react strongly with recombinant human nucleolin 1 283Nuc His produced in bacteria. As a positive control binding was compared to that obtained with mouse anti nucleolin MAb MS3 Santa Cruz Biotech while culture supernatant from a human B cell line raised in the same manner but producing IgG1 antibodies specific for H5 hemagglutinin human anti HA served as a negative control.

In order to test whether any or all of these anti nucleolin antibodies might have therapeutic potential the inventors have begun characterizing the antibodies by further ELISA analyses Western blotting flow cytometry immunohistochemistry and cytotoxic killing of MV4 11 cells. Four of the antibodies were initially screened further by ELISA in order to test whether they recognize endogenous nucleolin purified from MV4 11 human leukemia cells and to recombinant His tagged nucleolin 1 283 Nuc His produced in bacteria Ishimaru et al. 2009 . As can be seen in top panel supernatants from three out of four of the B cell lines 5D1 7G7 and 2D3 reacted with endogenous nucleolin with similar or higher intensity as mouse anti nucleolin MS3 while all bound the his tagged recombinant to varying degrees. In addition three of the four culture supernatants 5D1 3H11 and 2D3 reacted to the his tagged recombinant nucleolin by Western blotting bottom . Thus the antibodies had distinct patterns of binding to the endogenous and his tagged proteins and reacted differently in the Western blotting analysis possibly indicating that each recognizes distinct protein epitopes.

Anti Nucleolin Cytotoxicity to MV4 11 AML Cells and MCF 7 Breast Cancer Cells in the Absence of CDCC or ADCC.

While the binding analysis has fundamental significance from a therapeutic standpoint the most important criterion is that the antibodies mediate cytotoxicity. For this reason the inventors set up a simple flow cytometric based assay measuring induction of apoptosis and or cell death by propidium iodide PI and annexin V staining. Annexin V binds to phoshatidyl serine residues which become exposed on the cell membrane as an early event during induction of apoptosis. At later stages of apoptosis or during necrotic cell death disruption of membrane integrity makes the cells permeable to the non vital dye PI which can be detected through flow cytometry. MV4 11 cells were cultured for 16 h in the presence of each antibody and human serum which was used as a source of complement and is required for detecting complement dependent cellular cytotoxicity CDCC after which they were stained with PI and annexin V FITC. As can be seen in MV4 11 cells treated with human anti HA antibodies negative control showed no significant differences in either annexin V or PI staining compared with untreated cells. In contrast each of the anti nucleolin antibodies induced about a 3 fold shift in the mean fluorescence intensity of annexin V staining compared to untreated or anti HA treated cells. A similar shift was also seen in cells treated with staurosporine 25 M a chemical inducer of apoptosis. Anti nucleolin antibodies 5D1 and 7G7 were the most cytotoxic antibodies with 38 40 of cells staining positive for PI and or annexin V after 16 h compared to just 16 for control anti HA treatment while the other anti nucleolin antibodies induced cytotoxicity in 30 of cells. The relative cytotoxic activities of each antibody against MV4 11 leukemia cells are summarized in Table 4. These preliminary data indicate that more comprehensive cytotoxicity testing is warranted particularly for antibodies 5D1 and 7G7.

Similar experiments were performed with MCF 7 breast carcinoma cells which were found to be more sensitive to the anti nucleolin HuMAbs than were the MV4 11 cells. In the absence of complement the anti nucleolin HuMabs inhibited cell viability to less than 20 of untreated cells after 96 h while AS1411 reduced cell viability to just 80 of untreated cells and control human IgG had no effect FIG. A left panel . Complement dependent cytotoxicity was assayed in parallel experiments with the addition of human AB serum 25 vol vol as a source of complement. As can be seen in right panel the addition of complement potentiated the cytotoxic effects of the antibodies significantly inhibiting cell viability as early as 48 h with complete inhibition by 96 h. shows that the cytotoxic effects were selective for MCF 7 cells since the HuMAbs had no effect on cell viability of MCF 10A normal mammary epithelial cells that do not express cell surface nucleolin. Thus our panel of anti nucleolin HuMAbs bind specifically to cell surface nucleolin expressed on human AML and breast cancer cell lines and can induce substantial tumor cell cytotoxicity that is independent of the immune mechanisms of ADCC and CDCC. but can be potentiated by serum complement.
