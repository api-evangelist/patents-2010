The present disclosure relates to software computer systems and computer implemented methods for providing transparency to networked business processes.

In recent years companies have begun performing operations and transactions across company boundaries conducting business with external entities such as business partners distribution centers outsourcing companies compliance auditors banks logistics providers and others. For example many business models have evolved from single enterprise business models into inter connected and networked business models. As business models have begun to incorporate multiple entities communication and interactions within the networked business model remains difficult with each participant operating as a black box receiving an input and returning an output for further use in the networked business process.

Business process modeling notation BPMN is a standard for business process modeling and provides a graphical notification for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram BPD based on a flowcharting technique similar to activity diagrams from Unified Modeling Language UML . In general the objective of BPMN is to support business process management for both technical users and business users by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users yet capable of representing complex process semantics. Further the BPMN specification can provide a mapping between the graphics of the notation to the underlying constructs of execution languages including Business Process Execution Language. Because BPMN is understandable by both technical and business users networked business processes can be described using BPMN providing a common point of understanding for users from different entities.

The present disclosure involves systems software and computer implemented methods for providing a virtual process context to a plurality of network participants associated with a networked business process. One example method comprises associating a networked business process with a virtual process context the networked business process comprising a set of interrelated business processes performed by at least two different network participants receiving a first data object from a first network participant business process associated with the networked business process storing the received first data object in the virtual process context associated with the networked business process and notifying at least a second network participant of the stored first data object. In some instances notifying at least a second network participant of the stored first data object may include transmitting a copy of the first data object to at least a second network participant associated with the first data object.

While generally described as computer implemented software embodied on tangible media that processes and transforms the respective data some or all of the aspects may be computer implemented methods or further included in respective systems or other devices for performing this described functionality. The details of these and other aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

This disclosure generally describes computer systems software and computer implemented methods for providing increased transparency in networked business processes and between networked business process participants. The present disclosure provides tools and processes for allowing network participants to easily quickly and efficiently communicate status updates events and other process related information to one another as processes local to the network participants are performed and completed. In current systems network participants are often unable to understand view or receive information on processes being performed by other network participants. For example network participants may not know which other participants handle a particular request how long the particular request may take to be processed the current status of the particular request and its associated events as well as other information of interest. In general processes performed by other network participants are viewed as black box type events once requests signals or messages leave the requesting network participant. Because of the various unknown factors common to inter entity processes customers service providers and other potential participants are reluctant to integrate their new and existing processes into a networked business process. Without increased transparency the adoption of networked business processes will remain stagnant.

The present disclosure provides several methods of increased transparency associated with networked business processes. First the present disclosure describes a system and method for monitoring business interactions between network participants and their corresponding business processes that are involved in a networked business process. In general business interactions are monitored by a centralized monitoring system in a cloud based network where the monitoring system receives signals and or messages from the various network participants in response to particular events within those network participants local business processes. Once the signals and or messages are received the centralized monitoring system determines one or more of the other network participants with business processes or operations related to the received signals and or messages. The determined one or more of the other network participants are notified of the received signals and or messages providing the one or more other network participants with information and data associated with the business process being executed. In some instances the received signals and or messages can be used to determine or analyze the status of a particular process within an overall networked business process in order to calculate one or more metrics associated with a particular network participant or process. The centralized monitoring system can act as a router relay and manager of status information between network participants thereby providing increased transparency and confidence in networked business processes. In some instances the monitoring system can assist network participants in calculating the effectiveness timeliness and general capabilities of other network participants as well as in determining whether a particular business process within an overall networked business process is being performed satisfactorily.

The second tool for increased transparency in networked business processes described in the present disclosure is a virtual network process context shared across two or more network participants during the execution of the networked business process. In general integration between systems and processes occurs based on defined interfaces describing the expected input data and the expected result data associated with two systems. As networked business processes expand beyond two integrated systems and or processes however these interfaces decrease the transparency of networked business processes by limiting the sharing of information between the two integrated systems. BPM process runtimes however have the ability to carry at runtime a process context during the lifetime of the process instance. The process context stores information collected during the execution of the process steps including both predefined structured data e.g. eXtensible Markup Language XML based documents and unstructured data e.g. PDF documents .

The virtual network process context described herein provides a general repository in which data associated with the networked business process can be stored and or accessed by multiple network participants. The virtual network process context provides a delocalized store of networked business process information that can be updated and modified during the execution of the networked business process in order to maintain the most current process information across network participants. In other words the virtual network process context allows network process participants to seamlessly share information during the execution of the networked business process providing an efficient system for storing and sharing data relevant to the networked business process. In some instances the data stored in the virtual process context can replace traditional business to business B2B or application to application A2A messages currently sent to maintain consistency and data between network participants allowing information to be immediately accessible to and shared by all network participants.

The third tool for increased transparency described in the present disclosure is a system for analyzing the quality of services provided by a current proposed or potential network participant. As networked business processes are originally defined or updated information regarding the various network participants and their corresponding business processes is of assistance in determining the quality of interactivity transparency and compatibility that can be provided by an individual network participant or business process. Using metadata and other information associated with current and potential network participants a centralized tool for determining and managing the quality of services available from certain network participants or processes allows for knowledgeable decisions to be made prior to including a particular entity or process in a networked business process as well as for replacing current participants or processes included in the networked business process with one or more replacement entities or processes. In some instances the quality of services may define the level of transparency available from a particular entity or business process as well as the type of information that a particular entity or business process can provide to the other network participants associated with the networked business process.

In general the network participant servers and are any servers that store and execute business processes via one or more business process applications where the business process applications are associated with at least one networked business process performed across a plurality of the network participant servers . For example each server may be a Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition J2EE compliant application server that includes Java technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans EJB J2EE Connector Architecture JCA Java Messaging Service JMS Java Naming and Directory Interface JNDI and Java Database Connectivity JDBC . In some instances each server may store a plurality of various other applications while in other instances each server may be a dedicated server meant to store and execute a particular business process application and its related functionality. In some instances any of the servers may comprise a web server or be communicably coupled with a web server where the particular business process application for that server represents a web based application accessed and executed by the associated clients to perform the programmed tasks or operations of the corresponding business process application .

At a high level each server comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive transmit process store or manage data and information associated with the environment . Each server illustrated in can be responsible for receiving application requests from one or more clients or business process applications associated with one or more of the other network participant servers included in a networked business process responding to the received requests by processing said requests in the associated business process application and sending the appropriate responses from the business process application back to the requesting client business process application or centralized networked business process monitoring system illustrated in the set of cloud based services and information . The business process application can also process and respond to local requests from a user locally accessing the associated server . Accordingly in addition to requests from the external clients illustrated in requests associated with a particular business process application may also be sent from internal users external or third party customers and other automated business process applications as well as any other appropriate entities individuals systems or computers. In some instances each business process application may be a web based application executing functionality associated with the overall networked business process.

As used in the present disclosure the term computer is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example although illustrates three network participant servers environment can be implemented using any number of servers as well as computers other than servers including a server pool. Indeed each server may be any computer or processing device such as for example a blade server general purpose personal computer PC Macintosh workstation UNIX based workstation or any other suitable device. In other words the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further the illustrated servers may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux UNIX Windows Mac OS or any other suitable operating system. According to one implementation one or more of the servers may also include or be communicably coupled with a mail server.

In the illustrated implementation and as shown in each network participant server includes an interface a processor a memory and a business process application . The interface is used by each server to communicate with other systems in a client server or other distributed environment including within environment connected to the network e.g. an associated client or the set of cloud based services and information as well as other systems communicably coupled to the network . depicts both a server client environment as well as a cloud computing network. Various other implementations of the illustrated environment can be provided to allow for increased transparency in networked business processes including by allowing access to one or more of the business process applications through a node or location within a cloud computing network. In some instances the business process applications and may communicate with each other including via the networked business process monitoring system providing instructions and other information or data initiating or associated with one or more of the other business process applications . Generally each interface comprises logic encoded in software and or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically each interface may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network or interface s hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .

Generally each network participant server may be communicably coupled with a network that facilitates wireless or wireline communications between the components of the environment i.e. between the network participant servers their respective clients and or between the network participant servers and the set of cloud based services and information as well as with any other local or remote computer such as additional clients servers or other devices communicably coupled to network including those not illustrated in . In the illustrated environment the network is depicted as a single network in but may be comprised of more than one network without departing from the scope of this disclosure so long as at least a portion of the network may facilitate communications between senders and recipients. In some instances the network may include all or a portion of the set of cloud based services and information . The network may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network while in another instance at least a portion of the network may represent a connection to the Internet. In some instances a portion of the network may be a virtual private network VPN such as for example the connection between at least one of the network participant servers and the centralized networked business process monitoring system . Further all or a portion of the network can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links may include 802.11a b g n 802.20 WiMax and or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words the network encompasses any internal or external network networks sub network or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment . The network may communicate for example Internet Protocol IP packets Frame Relay frames Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM cells voice video data and other suitable information between network addresses. The network may also include one or more local area networks LANs radio access networks RANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs all or a portion of the Internet and or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations. The network however is not a required component in all implementations of the present disclosure.

As illustrated in each of the network participant servers and includes a processor . Although illustrated as a single processor in each of the network participant servers in two or more processors may be used in one or more of the illustrated servers according to particular needs desires or particular embodiments of environment . Each processor may be a central processing unit CPU a blade an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or another suitable component. Generally the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of corresponding network participant server and specifically the functionality associated with the corresponding business process application . In one implementation the server s processor executes the functionality required to receive and respond to requests and instructions from the corresponding client as well as the functionality required to perform the other operations of the associated business process application .

Regardless of the particular implementation software may include computer readable instructions firmware wired or programmed hardware or any combination thereof on a tangible and non transitory medium operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C C Java Visual Basic assembler Perl any suitable version of 4GL as well as others. It will be understood that while portions of the software illustrated in are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects methods or other processes the software may instead include a number of sub modules third party services components libraries and such as appropriate. Conversely the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate. In the illustrated environment each processor executes the corresponding business process application stored on the associated server . In some instances a particular network participant server may be associated with two or more business process applications .

At a high level each business process application is any application program module process or other software that may execute change delete generate or otherwise manage information associated with a particular network participant server and in some cases a networked business process combining interactions between two or more business process applications . In some instances a particular business process application may operate in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from an associated client . Additionally a particular business process application may operate in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from other business process applications including a business process application associated with another network participant server . In some instances information associated with a request may be relayed by or provided via the centralized networked business process monitoring system allowing requests updates and other information to be directed to a single location and providing the ability to easily expand a networked business process. Additionally each business process application may represent a web based application accessed and executed by remote clients via the network e.g. through the Internet or via the set of cloud based services and information . Further while illustrated as internal to a particular network participant server one or more processes associated with a particular business process application may be stored referenced or executed remotely. For example a portion of a particular business process application may be a web service associated with the business process application that is remotely called while another portion of the business process application may be an interface object or agent bundled for processing at a remote client . Moreover any or all of a particular business process application may be a child or sub module of another software module or enterprise application not illustrated without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Still further portions of the particular business process application may be executed or accessed by a user working directly at the corresponding network participant server as well as remotely at a corresponding client .

Two or more business process applications can be combined to create and perform a networked business process. A networked business process is an end to end business process performing operations across two or more network participants that perform different portions of an overall business process. In many instances a networked business process is performed across inter company borders and environments and can incorporate functionality provided independently from various different network participants. In some instances intermediate and end of process outputs and signals provided by one business process application may be used or considered when performing actions within another business process application in the same networked business process.

While the business process applications can be represented in any suitable notation many business process applications can be represented in Business Process Modeling Notation BPMN as illustrated in . BPMN current version 2.0 provides well known graphical notations for events activities and decisions performed within a particular overall process. BPMN is not necessarily tied to a particular underlying programming language and may be used with any suitable programming language including JAVA ABAP or C among others.

After the start event is triggered a first activity is performed. An activity in BPMN such as the first activity represents specific work or processes to be performed within the modeled business process or instance. Next the data associated with or results of the first activity are provided to an intermediate event . Intermediate events represent an event that occurs between the start and end event and can provide an opportunity for a business process to send information outside of the business process prior to the corresponding end event. For example and as illustrated in the intermediate event may be associated with a particular signal or message that is provided to an outbound agent where the outbound agent directs the outgoing signal or message to the appropriate location. Within environment the outbound agent may process the signal or message provided by the intermediate event and send that information to the centralized networked business process monitoring system for further processing. In other instances the outbound agent may send the signal or message directly to another participant within the illustrated environment such as the business process application of network participant server

Upon performing the operations of the intermediate event the business process instance continues at the second activity where additional processing or operations are performed. Business process instance includes a second intermediate event after the second activity where again information associated with the current status and state of the business process instance is provided to the outbound agent . In some instances the signal or message sent by the intermediate event can be sent to the same location as the prior intermediate event e.g. the centralized networked business process monitoring system or another business process application within environment or a different location or recipient. In some instances the signal or message can be sent to the same location but relayed to a different recipient.

After the second intermediate event a decision step is provided. The decision step may also be called a gateway and can be used to determine based on the data flow within the associated business process instance how to fork split or otherwise direct the control flow of the business process instance . In some instances gateways may be used to merge separate flows in a business process instance such as when concurrently performed operations are combined to perform another activity. Based on the conditions received at the decision step the business process instance continues at either the third activity or the fourth activity . Once the operations associated with the correct activity are performed the business process instance completes the business process at end event . The end event represents the result of a process and similar to an intermediate event can return the results of the process. In the current example the end event presents the results of the process to the outbound agent which can then forward those results to any suitable location or recipient. In some instances multiple outbound agents may be used in place of the single illustrated outbound agent .

Returning to additional modules including the inbound agent the outbound agent a message filter and a context module are illustrated within the network participant server . All some or none of the modules may be included within the other network participant servers and Additionally some or all of the modules may be combined as well as integrated into the functionality provided by another component. As described in the inbound agent forwards messages and information received via the interface to the appropriate location within a business process application or any other locations within the network participant server . In some instances the inbound agent may direct messages to a particular activity or element of a business process application as well as to a particular business process application in implementations where the network participant server is associated with two or more business process applications . The inbound agent can forward messages sent from the centralized networked business process monitoring system to the network participant server . In some implementations however the inbound agent may also include a listener module which may be associated with the centralized networked business process monitoring system . The listener module can poll or otherwise determine from the centralized networked business process monitoring system when new messages or signals are available received and or generated. If a new message or signal is detected by the listener module and if the new message or signal available at the centralized networked business process monitoring system is associated with a business process application at the inbound agent s respective network participant server the inbound agent may request or retrieve a copy of the message or signal from the networked business process monitoring system . Where messages and other information are sent directly to the network participant server the message filter module may perform initial processing and analysis associated with the incoming message or information to determine its relevance and appropriate destination within the network participant server . For example if the received message is relevant to or associated with a particular business process application the message filter module may provide the received message to the inbound agent corresponding to the business process application . Alternatively the message filter module may be a part of or interchangeable with at least a portion of the inbound agent . For example the message filter module may identify the appropriate location of a message or information from the centralized networked business process monitoring system and forward that information directly to the appropriate business process application or portion thereof.

The outbound agent may be used to send signals messages and other information associated with the business process application to the networked business process monitoring system . Events and actions in the business process application associated with output or other intermediate events may provide associated data messages and information to the outbound agent where the outbound agent determines the location to which the information is to be sent. In some instances output from a business process application may be first provided to the message filter module which may determine which sets of information or messages are to be sent outside of the network participant server . In some instances only a portion of the messages and information generated by a particular business process application may be shared outside the network participant server with the message filter module determining whether a particular message or other information is provided to the outbound agent . In some instances the message filter module may be a part of or may replace the functionality of the outbound agent such that the message filter module determines which information is to be shared outside the network participant server and subsequently sends that information to the appropriate locations itself.

The network participant server is also illustrated as including a context module . Although not illustrated as such the other network participant servers and may also include context modules. The context module may be executed by the processor and can provide services associated with the business process application . The context module can provide interfaces modules services or metadata definitions that enable the business process application to provide accessibility to data objects stored in a local process context within memory . The context module can also include functionality to provide context information associated with the business process application with a centralized and networked virtual process context module within the set of cloud based services and information . For example when actions associated with the local business process application modify the data associated with a local or network process context the context module can send the updated information to the virtual process context module for inclusion in and modification of the network process context .

The context module performs operations for storing and accessing process context information associated with a particular local business process application as well as by receiving and or retrieving process context information from a virtual process context module associated with a networked business process performed across a plurality of network participant servers and utilizing a plurality of interrelated business process applications e.g. and . In some instances the context module may monitor the virtual process context module for new or modified context information associated with the networked business process. If new or modified context information is identified the context module can request or retrieve the updated context information and store that information locally within the local process context . Additionally the context module may receive notifications of context updates from the virtual process context module and in response thereto may retrieve the associated context updates and modification to ensure that the local process context is up to date with the network process context . In some instances the context module may be a service process or module solely for interacting with a network process context stored in the set of cloud based services and information . Instead of storing the information locally the context module may access the network process context directly such as through a web service call to retrieve and access the network process context associated with the networked business process. In those instances a local process context may be maintained at the network participant server . The local process context may be used for backup purposes or for where no modifications to the network process context have been identified such that the local process context represents the current version of the network process context .

In general each network participant server also includes a memory for storing data and program instructions. Each memory may include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component. Each memory may store various objects or data including classes frameworks applications backup data business objects jobs web pages web page templates database tables process contexts repositories storing services local to the corresponding network participant server and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto associated with the purposes of the corresponding server and its business process application .

As illustrated memory includes a message store a local process context and a network participant profile . In some implementations memories and may also include their own instances of some or all of these components. The message store represents a set of collected messages signals and other information sent from the outbound agent and or received by the inbound agent associated with the business process application . In some instances all messages associated with the networked business process may be stored in the local message store while in other instances only those messages deemed relevant to or associated with the local business process application may be stored therein. The message store may act as a backup or repository for networked business process interactions allowing the local business process application and other local operations to quickly access the stored messages and information for any purpose.

The local process context as described above can store information associated with the process context of a particular local business process application as well as the process context associated with a networked business process of which the local business process application is a part. In some instances the local process context may only store information associated with the local business process application . In other instances the local process context may store or cache information from the virtual process context module and its network process context . Depending on the availability of the virtual process context module as well as the age and validity of the local process context information the context module and the local business process application can use the cached network process context information stored in the local process context instead of accessed the network process context .

The network participant profile represents a set of metadata and information associated with a particular network participant server its available business process applications and the network participant server s technical capabilities. In some instances the network participant profile may be generated manually such as through a definition process of questions and answers presented to and prepared by a representative associated with the corresponding network participant. The network participant profile may also be generated automatically at least in part based on known information associated with a particular network participant from the network participant s previous interactions. In some instances the profile itself may be generated and or modified using a participant profile generator associated with a network participant profile module located in the set of cloud based services and information in . As an example a particular network participant profile may include information and or metadata defining whether the network participant can publish information associated with start and or end events intermediate events and milestones and error events as well as provide support for business process termination business process compensation and or ad hoc modification to a business process. An analysis of these and other criteria and information within the network participant profile can be used by other network participants or automated processes within the set of cloud based services and information to determine whether a particular network participant or network participant business process application should or can be included in a networked business process. Network participant profiles may also or alternatively be stored remotely from the associated network participant such as in a set of network participant profiles stored in the set of cloud based services and information

The illustrated environment of also includes one or more clients associated with each of the network participant servers . Each client may be any computing device operable to connect to or communicate with at least the corresponding network participant server using a wireline or wireless connection via the network or another suitable communication means. In some instances the client may be a part of a particular network participant server . In general each client may include a processor an interface a graphical user interface GUI and a memory. In general client comprises an electronic computer device operable to receive transmit process and store any appropriate data associated with the environment of . It will be understood that there may be any number of clients associated with or external to environment . For example while illustrated environment includes three clients and connected to particular network participant servers and respectively alternative implementations of environment may include multiple clients communicably coupled to the one or more of the network participant servers as well as other clients not specifically connected to or associated with a particular network participant server . In some instances at least one client may be associated with an administrator of the networked business process and may be capable of modifying information and data associated with the networked business process as well as each individual business process application . Additionally there may also be one or more additional clients external to the illustrated portion of environment capable of interacting with the environment via the network . Further the terms client and user may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover while each client is described in terms of being used by a single user this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer or that one user may use multiple computers.

The GUI associated with each client may comprise a graphical user interface operable to for example allow the user of a client to interface with at least a portion of an associated business process application for any suitable purpose such as inputting and interacting with information and data associated with a particular business process application within a networked business process as well as any other suitable application. Generally the GUI provides the particular user with an efficient and user friendly presentation of business data provided by or communicated within the system. The GUI may comprise a plurality of customizable frames or views having interactive fields pull down lists and buttons operated by the user. For example the GUI may provide interactive elements that allow a user to interact with a particular business process application the centralized networked business process monitoring system the virtual process context module and or the network participant profile module . The various portions of the associated business process application as well as portions of the overall networked business process may be presented and accessible to the user through the GUI such as through a web browser. Generally the GUI may also provide general interactive elements that allow a user to access and utilize various services and functions of a particular network participant server as well as that server s business process application . The GUI is often configurable supports a combination of tables and graphs bar line pie status dials etc. and is able to build real time portals where tabs are delineated by key characteristics e.g. site or micro site . Therefore the GUI contemplates any suitable graphical user interface such as a combination of a generic web browser intelligent engine and command line interface CLI that processes information in the platform and efficiently presents the results to the user visually.

As used in this disclosure each client is intended to encompass a personal computer touch screen terminal workstation network computer kiosk wireless data port smart phone personal data assistant PDA one or more processors within these or other devices or any other suitable processing device. For example each client may comprise a computer that includes an input device such as a keypad touch screen mouse or other device that can accept user information and an output device that conveys information associated with the operation of the associated network participant server a portion of the set of cloud based services and information and or the client itself including digital data visual information or the GUI. Both the input and output device may include fixed or removable storage media such as a magnetic storage media CD ROM or other suitable media to both receive input from and provide output to users of client through the display namely the GUI.

Although not illustrated as such the client may also include a processor interface and memory similar to those described in connection with the network participant servers although alternative implementations of one or more of these components may be used as well as implementations where additional components may also be included.

In the present disclosure the set of cloud based services and information includes several on demand or cloud based services including a centralized networked business process monitoring system a virtual process context module and a network participant profile module . In addition the set of cloud based services and information includes several associated information repositories including a message store associated with the centralized networked business process monitoring system a set of networked business process metadata associated with the centralized networked business process monitoring system and the network participant profile module and a set of network participant profiles . The components illustrated in the set of cloud based services and information may be stored in a single cloud based network as illustrated in while in other implementations some or all of the components may be distributed between other cloud based networks locations and services as well as in or with one or more of the illustrated network participant servers .

At a high level the centralized networked business process monitoring system the virtual process context module and the network participant profile module are any applications programs modules processes or other software that may execute change delete generate or otherwise manage information associated with networked business processes that include business process applications across a plurality of network participants in order to provide more transparent interactions between inter company or inter entity transactions and operations. The centralized networked business process monitoring system the virtual process context module and the network participant profile module may be separate components in some implementations as illustrated in while in other implementations may be comprised of fewer or additional components. Further different implementations of environment may include a subset of the elements within the set of cloud based services and information described herein.

The centralized networked business process monitoring system is a centralized location for monitoring the operations of each business process application interacting in a networked business process. In general the centralized networked business process monitoring system is provided information associated with the interrelatedness of the various network participant servers and their corresponding business process applications and acts as a central hub or relay for providing information associated with those applications outputs and statuses within the networked business process environment. The centralized networked business process monitoring system allows individual applications to send a single instance of a message or signal into the set of cloud based services and information at which the centralized networked business process monitoring system receives the information and determines which of the other network participants associated with the networked business process should receive the information.

As illustrated the centralized networked business process monitoring system can include a receiving module and a broadcast module . The receiving module may be an interface or other known location to which information is sent from the various network participant servers associated with a networked business process. In some current systems the information is directly transmitted to each of the related network participant servers by the sending network participant server . In the present disclosure the information may be sent once e.g. by a single message or signal to the receiving module where the information is received and in some cases stored within a cloud based message store .

Once received the centralized networked business process monitoring system can analyze the received information to determine which of the network participant servers and or specific business process applications should be sent or notified of the received message or information. To that end the centralized networked business process monitoring system includes a broadcast module . The broadcast module can send the message or information received by the monitoring system to the identified network participant servers and or business process applications . Alternatively the broadcast module can provide notifications to particular network participant servers and or business process applications that new messages and or information are available allowing the associated business process application and network participant servers to retrieve the message and or information individually. Additionally the broadcast module may set a parameter or other value within the monitoring system associated with an updated set of networked business process information. One or more of the outbound agents associated with various network participant servers may poll the monitoring system at regular and or predefined intervals or in response to an event and in response to the identifying that a modified value or set of data is available request the updated information. In some instances the set parameter may specify a subset of all network participant servers associated with the updated information allowing network participant servers to immediately determine whether a request to the centralized networked business process monitoring system is necessary.

The networked business process monitoring system may also be able to perform networked business process analyses to determine whether the network participants and or business process applications are performing satisfactorily. For example the various messages and information received by the monitoring system may include status information associated with the different business process applications executing in the networked business process in addition to data output by the operations associated with those applications . The networked business process may be associated with a set of networked business process metadata defining information regarding the interactions and requirements of the networked business process as a whole as well as the individual business process applications . In some instances certain requirements or milestones associated with individual business process applications may be defined such as performance time and standards. The monitoring system using the information received from the various business process applications may be able to analyze whether certain performance indicators such as time requirements or performance requirements associated with service level agreements between companies and participants have been met. In other instances the monitoring system can use the status and output information received from the various business process applications to diagnose issues within the networked business process such as bottlenecks errors and other system relevant issues within the inter company or inter entity based networked business process. If issues are identified by the monitoring system appropriate network participants and or administrators may be notified to allow for the issues to be rectified. These analyses performed by the monitoring system provide inter company awareness and knowledge of the processes and applications performed by other network participants thereby removing the previous black box situations in prior systems and providing increased transparency to each network participant. The messages and information associated with the centralized networked business process monitoring system and the networked business processes in general may be provided as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP messages. Alternative implementations may use any other suitable messaging protocol such as email based messaging.

As previously described the set of cloud based services and information includes a virtual process context module . The virtual process context module provides a process context shared between business processes and business process applications included in and associated with a networked business process. In general context information is provided by shared and accessed by each of the individual business process applications via web service requests sent through network . Each virtual process context module may include more than one network process context with each network process context associated with a different networked business process or alternatively a different instance of the same networked business process. Each network process context may provide access rights to users clients and business process applications associated with the corresponding networked business process or instance thereof and may prevent access to stored data objects and other information stored therein to requests made by non associated applications and or entities. In some instances the virtual process context module may send updated context data to associated applications and network participant servers when modifications to the network process context are made. Alternatively and or additionally the virtual process context module can notify or otherwise signal to associated applications and network participant servers that modifications to a network process context have been made without sending the updated information. In some instances the notification may include information that can allow the network participant server and or the business process application to determine if a retrieval of the updated network process context is needed. In some instances the virtual process context module may communicate with one or more local context modules located at the associated network participant servers to provide the information directly.

The set of cloud based services and information further includes the network participant profile module . The network participant profile module provides tools and functionality for analyzing the quality of services capable of being or already provided by a potential or current network participant and or a particular business process application associated with a potential or current network participant. The network participant profile module can generate new network participant profiles e.g. or and analyze existing network participant profiles to determine if the corresponding network participant is allowed to be included in an existing or newly created networked business process. As described above various types of information associated with a network participant and or a business process application can be included in a network participant profile . For example and as described above a network participant profile may include information and or metadata defining whether the network participant can publish information associated with start and or end events intermediate events and milestones and error events as well as provide support for business process termination business process compensation and or ad hoc modification to a business process. In general this information describes the relative transparency of a network participant or its associated applications and the network participant s ability to provide transparent services to a networked business process. Additionally the information in a particular profile may also be associated with other any other performance and or cost related metrics or capabilities.

The network participant profile module includes a participant profile generator and a participant profile analyzer . The participant profile generator can comprise a web based service or application allowing a representative of a network participant to register with the network participant profile module and provide information on the capabilities of its network participant server and or its business process applications . In some instances the participant profile generator may generate at least a portion of some network participant profiles automatically based on information provided by other network participants determined or derived by previous experiences or interactions with the network participant as well as based on an analysis of a particular business process application associated with the network participant and its associated server . In some instances a network participant profile may be imported by the participant profile generator

The participant profile analyzer is a tool used by the network participant profile module to determine if a proposed network participant provides capabilities as required or preferred by a networked business process. The participant profile analyzer may be used in different situations such as when a networked business process is being expanded to add additional functionality. For example if a new network participant is needed to provide a new operation or business process application the participant profile analyzer retrieves from the set of networked business process metadata information on the parameters required by and or preferred by a particular networked business process combination. Those parameters can be defined when a networked business process is originally designed as well as any other suitable time. Once the parameters are identified the potential network participant s network participant profile is compared to the set of parameters . If one or more of the required parameters are not met by the network participant profile the potential network participant may be rejected or indicated as insufficient according to the parameters . If one or more of the preferred parameters are not met the participant profile analyzer may perform an algorithm to determine the level of transparency provided by the potential network participant profile in light of the preferred parameters . Certain networked business processes may be associated with a minimum threshold value as determined by the participant profile analyzer . If the algorithm determines that the level of transparency provided by the potential network participant profile falls below that minimum threshold then that participant may be rejected. If however the level of transparency is determined to be greater than the minimum threshold then the associated network participant may be considered for addition to the networked business process.

In some instances the participant profile analyzer may also be used when determining a potential replacement to an existing network participant. An outgoing network participant and associated business process application may be identified such as when a particular network participant and its business process application fail to meet certain performance metrics as determined by the centralized networked business process monitoring system . A set of potential replacement network participants and or business process applications may then be identified based on the functionality to be replaced. In some instances the participant profile analyzer may perform the functionality associated with identifying potential replacements while in other instances another module or application may do so. Once the set of potential replacement network participants and associated business process applications are determined the participant profile analyzer can compare each of the potential replacement network participants to the parameters defined for the underlying networked business process. The participant profile analyzer may then rank the potential replacement network participants based on their corresponding scores or compatibility values as determined by the algorithm associated with the participant profile analyzer . An administrator or set of administrators can then review and use the ranking information to determine a preferable replacement for the networked business process. In some instances the participant profile analyzer may be used to find the best network participant profile matching a combination of required and preferred networked business process criteria including criteria associated with the relative transparency of the participant or process. The determination of a potential replacement network participant may be performed in connection with a determination from the centralized networked business process monitoring system that one or more current network participants are not meeting performance requirements allowing the network participant profile module and the monitoring system to work together to suggest replacements for underperforming network participants and or business process applications .

While is described as containing or being associated with a plurality of elements not all elements illustrated within environment of may be utilized in each alternative implementation of the present disclosure. For example although depicts a cloud based environment implementing the various tools and functionality of the present disclosure any of the components within the set of cloud based services and information can be located in a specific non cloud based server within environment . Further although depicts network participant servers external to network servers may be included within the network as part of a cloud computing network solution for example. Additionally one or more of the elements described herein may be located external to environment while in other instances certain elements may be included within or as a portion of one or more of the other described elements as well as other elements not described in the illustrated implementation. Further certain elements illustrated in may be combined with other components as well as used for alternative or additional purposes in addition to those purposes described herein.

One example of the business interaction monitoring can be described in the context of switching electricity providers. Using the illustration of network participant server A is associated with a current electricity retailer associated with a customer network participant server B is associated with a new electricity retailer associated with the customer and network participant server C is associated with an electricity provider or distributor. The overall networked business process is associated with switching electricity providers based on a request submitted by the customer. In some instances the associated switch process may have a required or preferred deadline for completion. For purposes of the illustrated example the time to complete a switch based on a customer s request is no longer than six weeks.

The first business application process associated with the current electricity retailer is initiated based on the request from the customer. Once a first activity of the first business application process is completed an intermediate event is used to send a message or other signal to the business interaction monitoring system as illustrated by arrow . In some instances this message may be provided in XMPP or any other suitable messaging protocol. The business interaction monitoring system can determine based on the received signal that two concurrent business process applications and should be initiated. The monitoring system sends process initiating messages to the respective start events of business process applications and as illustrated by arrows and where the choreography of the messages to be sent by the monitoring system is based on the known relationships and interactions between the individual processes included in the networked business process. In addition to providing information on when the other network participant processes and are to begin the signal or message provided by the intermediate event can provide information for an analysis of the networked business process. One example is the time taken from the customer s request until the message sent from intermediate event is sent which may indicate the time taken to complete the first activity in the corresponding business process application

Similar messages and signals may be sent when the second processes reach their associated intermediate events and respectively providing additional information to the monitoring system on the overall networked business process. In some instances information generated by steps or operations within one business process application may be sent to another business process application as input associated with a particular activity or operation. As the new electricity retailer using business process application creates a new account for the customer and prepares the first provision of services the intermediate event may be triggered and send a message via the monitoring system to the energy provider s corresponding business process application indicating that a change to the retailer associated with the customer should occur. Multiple messages and signals and may be associated with the various intermediate events and end events of the associated business process applications .

In general any milestone within the respective applications may be represented by an intermediate event with a related message or signal sent to the monitoring system. The intermediate events can be used to provide additional transparency as well as provide analytics associated with the overall networked business process and the individual business process applications . For example various milestones can be monitored and compared to key performance indicators KPIs service level agreements SLAs and other metrics. These comparisons can provide valuable information on whether a particular networked business process is performing adequately as well as whether one or more of the business process applications need to be replaced or modified for better performance. At the same time the monitoring system can provide transparent information associated with the status of both the networked business process and individual business process applications .

At a networked business process is identified. The networked business process may be identified by generating or creating a new networked business process by an administrator or process developer combining and or associating two or more individual business processes or business process applications into a single networked business process performed across the two or more business processes. The particular networked business process may also be identified or selected from a set of predefined networked business processes.

At communication parameters for the process participants associated with the networked business process are identified. Identifying the communication parameters may include identifying events activities signals messages and or outputs to be received from one or more process participants performing various business processes included within the networked business process and determining where the received information is to be forwarded or relayed. Determining where the received information is to be forwarded or relayed may include identifying the type of information that is to be provided to which of the individual business processes as well as the locations within those individual business processes to which the information is to be forwarded or relayed. In some instances the information may be sent to a start event associated with a particular individual business process while in other instances the information may be sent to an activity or operation included after the start event of a particular individual business process. Still further identifying the communication parameters associated with the various process participants may include determining the type of communication e.g. XMPP message email message etc. compatible with the receiving entity or process participant. Different types of communication protocols and methods may be used when relaying or delivering information to different process participants such that a first process participant may receive information in a first protocol while a second process participant may receive information in a different second protocol.

At a signal or message associated with the networked business process is received from a particular process participant. The signal or message received from the particular process participant may be in any suitable format or protocol. In some instances different process participants and business processes or process applications may provide information to the centralized networked business process monitoring system in different formats. In some instances all communications may be in the same protocol or format while in other instances different types of communications may be received from different process participants as well as different types of communications associated with different events from the same process participant.

At an action associated with the received signal or message is identified. In some instances the action associated with the received signal or message may be to store the information in a signal or message store or to store information associated with the received signal or message in a database for later use or analysis. In other instances the action associated with the received signal or message may cause a response signal or message to be sent to one or more of the process participants. In some particular instances the action associated with the received signal or message may be to send a response signal message or other communication back to the process participant associated with the received signal or message.

At a determination is made as to whether the identified action is associated with generating a responsive or related message or signal to at least one process participant. If the determination indicates that no new message or signal is to be generated method continues at . If however the identified action is associated with generating a responsive message or signal based on the received message or signal method continues at .

At a message signal or other set of information associated with the identified action and based on the received signal or message is generated. At at least one process participant associated with the generated message is identified. In some instances the actions associated with the received signal or message may be based on particular interactions within various process participants in the networked business process. To determine where the generated message or signal is to be relayed or sent the interactions governing the networked business process may be consulted or reviewed by the monitoring system. As noted at least one process participant associated with the generated message is identified. In some instances responsive messages may be relayed published or made available to all process participants with each process participant performing a filtering operation to determine if the generated message or signal is associated with that particular process participant. Alternatively the generated message or signal may be sent only to those process participants to whom the generated message or signal is directly associated. Still further in some instances the generated message or signal or other information is not sent to any process participants. Instead the fact that the message or signal has been generated is made available with the process participants able to retrieve or access the generated message or signal.

Once the at least one process participant associated with the generated message is identified the at least one process participant associated with the generated message or signal is notified of the message or signal at . As stated above in some instances notifying the at least one process participant associated with the generated message comprises sending the generated message to the at least one associated process participant. In other instances notifying the at least one process participant associated with the generated message comprises sending a notification to the at least one associated process participant and thereafter allowing the at least one associated process participant to access the generated message or signal. In still other instances neither the generated message or signal nor a notification thereof may be sent to the associated process participant. Instead the monitoring system may provide an updated set of information at the monitoring system available to all process participants. By polling the monitoring system the process participants can determine whether a message or signal associated with a particular process participant is available and if so request or retrieve the generated message or signal.

At a determination is made as to whether a new message or signal associated with the networked business process is received. If a new message or signal is received method returns to . If no new message or signal is received method continues or loops at until the next message is received. Although not illustrated in method the centralized networked business process monitoring system may also perform an analysis on each received message or signal including in some instances identifying the source of the message or signal identifying or storing the information included in the received message or signal and deriving at least one performance metric associated with the networked business process or a particular individual business process.

At a networked business process associated with a locally executed business process or business process application is identified. At the locally executed business process or local business process is registered with a centralized networked business interaction monitoring system based on the identification of the associated networked business process. As described above the centralized networked business interaction monitoring system provides transparency to all participants within the identified networked business process allowing status information about the various business processes executing portions of the networked business process to be shared among the various process participants. Additionally information provided to the centralized networked business interaction monitoring system allows various analytics and performance analyses to be identified and performed on both the local business process and the overall networked business process providing additional feedback to administrators developers and users as to the effectiveness and quality of the networked business process. In some instances registering the local business process with the monitoring system provides information to the monitoring system with regard to the operations and activities performed by the local business process as well as the types of signals and messages that will be generated thereby. Further the registration may provide the centralized monitoring system with information defining the messaging and signaling protocols and formats associated with the local business process.

At an action or indication associated with a start event of the local business process is received. In some instances the action or indication may comprise a message or signal received from the centralized monitoring system in response to a message or signal received from another business process of the networked business process. In other instances the action or indication may be received from a client or user associated with the local business process through which the networked business process is begun.

At the local business process is initiated in response to the action or indication received at . In some instances initiating the local business process may also initiate the networked business process such as when the local business process represents the initial steps or operations in the networked business process. In other instances the local business process may instead be a continuation of the networked business process and may initiate the local business process based on a message or signal received from another business process in the networked business process. Further the message or signal received from the other business process in the networked business process may include or define initial parameters or values to be used in the local business process. Initiating the local business process may comprise initiating the local business process according to the parameters or values received from another business process within the networked business process.

At a local business process step is performed including any activities or operations associated with the step. At a determination is made as to whether the performed local business process step is associated with an intermediate or other event that causes a message or signal to be sent to the centralized monitoring system. If no message or signal is to be sent method moves to . If however a message or signal associated with the local business process step is to be sent method moves to where the centralized monitoring system is notified of the event and its associated message. Notifying the centralized monitoring system may include sending a message or signal directly to the centralized monitoring system as part of the local business process step. In other instances notifying the centralized monitoring system may comprise providing the information associated with the step to an outbound agent and or message filter module which in turn processes formats and sends the information associated with the performed local business process step to the centralized monitoring system. In some instances each local business process step may be determined to be associated with a signal event or message such that the information associated with the performed step is provided to the outbound agent or message filter module. Once at the outbound agent or message filter module a determination may then be made as to whether the information should actually be forwarded to the centralized monitoring system. Once the centralized monitoring system is notified method continues at .

At a determination is made at to whether there are additional steps or activities in the local business process. If additional steps remain method returns to where the next local business step is performed. If no additional steps remain method ends at where the local business process is completed. In some instances completing the local business process may include providing a final set of data or a final message or signal to the centralized monitoring system. In some instances the final data message or signal may be relayed to another business process within the networked business process and or stored in a message or data store in a cloud based system either for backup purposes or for performing analytics on the local business process and or the overall networked business process.

The virtual process context module includes a network process context . As described above the network process context is associated with the networked business process and stores and makes available to process participants the data objects including both structured and unstructured data that is used or manipulated during the execution of the networked business process and by extension the multiple local business processes . In some instances the context modules associated with each of the local business processes may be used to access store and retrieve the data directly from the network process context as needed during execution of the corresponding local business process . In some instances concurrently executing local business processes may modify one or more data objects at various times. In order to provide the most up to date data objects for the concurrently executed local business processes the associated one or more data objects can be maintained within the network process context in the set of cloud based services and information . The local process contexts may be used as a local backup to the networked process context in cases where the virtual process context module is unavailable due to a lack of connection with the set of cloud based services and information or any other possible reason. Each local process context can be maintained by the corresponding context module to provide quick and efficient local access to the current data objects.

As illustrated by arrows and each of the network participant servers can send information to access or retrieve information from the network process context . In some instances the virtual process context module may authenticate the requesting entity prior to providing access to the network process context ensuring that the network process context is accessible only to those network participants and processes associated with the networked business process. Additionally when modifications are made to data objects within the network process context the virtual process context module may in some instances notify the associated process participants of the modified network process context . Thus each process participant and local business process may be kept up to date as to the current status of the network process context and any changes to the data objects therein.

In some instances a notification of the modified network process context may be sent to the each local context modules associated with the local business process . Alternatively notification of the modification may only be sent to particular local context modules associated with the local business process that are directly affected by the modification. The notification may include a message or set of information defining the changes themselves or a message or signal that modifications have occurred thus allowing the context modules themselves to access the virtual process context module in order to access and retrieve the modifications to the network process context . One advantage of the virtual process context module may be to provide a transparent but shared process context that allows the related local business processes to share and access the network process context in a manner similar to how a local process context is accessed. In the present instance the virtual process context module can be accessed through a web or on demand service to virtualize the access to the single network process context for each of the process participants and local business processes .

At a networked business process associated with at least two network participants and their local business processes or network participant processes is identified. In some instances identifying the networked business process may include associating or linking the identified networked business process with the virtual process context module as well as creating or generating the networked business process itself. In some instances associating or linking the identified networked business process with the virtual process context module may occur automatically in response to the creation or design of a networked business process or may be performed manually by an administrator or designer associated with the identified networked business process.

At a determination is made as to whether a network process context is associated with the identified networked business process. In some instances a network process context may be generated when the networked business process is identified at . For example the identified networked business process may already be associated with a network process context. If a network process context is determined to be associated with the networked business process then method continues at . If however the networked business process does not have an associated network process context method continues at .

At a network process context associated with the identified networked business process is initialized. In some instances may not occur until the first local business process associated with the overall networked business process is started. Stated otherwise the network process context for the identified networked business process may not be initialized until the identified networked business process is itself initiated. Initializing the network process context associated with the networked business process may include creating a network process context specifically associated with the networked business process its network participants and their associated local business process and business process applications. In some instances the virtual process context module may maintain and manage multiple network process contexts with each network process context associated with a different networked business process and or different instances of a particular networked business process.

At a data object associated with a first network participant process included in or associated with the networked business process is received by the virtual process context module. At the virtual process context module stores the received data object in the network process context associated with the networked business process. In some instances different portions of the network process context may be associated with different types of data objects as well as data objects associated with different portions of the networked process context. The virtual process context module may determine where or how to store the received data object to allow other participant processes within the networked business process to access the data.

At the virtual process context module identifies one or more network participant processes associated with the received and stored data object. In some instances all participant processes may be identified as associated with the data object. Alternatively only a subset of the participant processes within the networked business process may be identified as associated with the data object. For example if the data object is only relevant to and used in a business process associated with a first participant process but is not used in business processes associated with a second and third participant process then only the first participant process may be identified at . The relevance of a particular data object to various participant processes may be identified in the networked business process model metadata or elsewhere. If there is no information defining the relevancy of a particular data object to a particular set of participant processes all participant processes within the networked business process may be identified.

At the identified network participant processes associated with the data object are notified of the data object s addition and or modifications. Notifying the identified network participant processes associated with the data object allows the network process context to be shared within the networked business process. Notifying the identified network participant processes may include transmitting a copy of the stored data object to the context modules associated with the identified network participant processes thereby allowing the network participant processes to have immediate access to the data object. The notification may also or alternatively comprise a notice or message indicating to the network participant process that a data object associated with that network participant process has been modified. Where notifying the identified network participant processes does not include a copy of the data object the identified network participant processes may access the network process context immediately to retrieve or read the data object or the identified network participant processes may wait to access the network process context for the data object until the data object is needed or is to be used in the corresponding network participant process. In some instances the data object can be read from the network process context as the network participant process is performing operations associated with or based on the data object.

At a request to access a particular data object within a network process context is received. The request for access to the data object may be sent based on a notification sent to one or more network participant processes. In other instances the request may be received at the start of a networked business process from a particular network participant process to retrieve information on an initial or updated set of preliminary information and or data objects stored at the network process context.

At a determination is made as to whether the requestor is associated with the networked business process and by extension the network process context. If the requestor is not associated with the networked business process method continues at where access to the data object is denied. If however the requestor is associated with the networked business process then method continues at where a determination is made as to whether the requestor is allowed access to the particular requested data object. In some instances some data objects stored within the network process context may only be accessible to a subset of the network participant processes included within the networked business process. For example a network participant process unrelated to a particular data object may not have access rights associated with that data object in order to provide protection from inadvertent modifications and or unauthorized access. If it is determined that the requestor is not allowed access to the data object then method continues at where access to the data object is denied. If however the requester is associated with the networked business process and is allowed access to the requested data object method continues to .

At access to the requested data object is provided. The level of access to the data object provided to different requestors may differ based on the needs and rights of the requestor. For example the requestor may provided read only rights allowing access to the data object but not the ability to modify it. In some instances each participant process may have the ability to access each data object within the network process context with only some network participant processes having the ability to modify and manipulate the data object.

At an updated data object and or new data objects are received from the requestor. In some instances the updated data object and or new data objects may be received after the requestor performs one or more operations within an associated network participant business process based on or related to the accessed data object. Once the updated data object is received the updated data object is stored in the network process context at . Although not illustrated as such in additional operations similar to and of may be performed in order to notify one or more network participant processes of the changes and modifications to data objects within the networked business process. Still further both methods and can be performed in multiple instances in which some of those instances operate concurrently in order to provide information associated with a plurality of network participant processes performed simultaneously. In other words the virtual process context module may be capable of handling multiple simultaneous requests and updating different data objects during the execution of multiple interrelated participant business processes within the networked business process.

Each current and potential network participant server is illustrated as including a local business process and a local network participant profile . In some instances the network participant profile associated with a particular network participant server may not be stored at the network participant server but instead may be stored in the set of network participant profiles . In the example of the initial networked business process includes the local business processes and . Arrows and indicate communications and information exchanges between the network participant servers via the set of cloud based services and information such as status and context information as described in connection with respectively.

In one example the administrator or designer of the networked business process may determine that additional functionality is to be added to the networked business process. In the current example the new functionality is to be provided by a new network participant. In some instances the participant profile analyzer may review the networked business process parameters to determine the required and preferred services functionality and overall quality of services associated with network participants in the networked business process. The participant profile analyzer may then review the set of network participant profiles to determine which of the plurality of potential network participants meets the functionality desired by the administrator or designer as well as the quality of services specified by the networked business process parameters . In other words the participant profile analyzer can search for identify and rank potential network participants based on their functionality and quality of services.

Alternatively a specific network participant and its local business process is proposed as a potential addition to the networked business process with the participant profile analyzer determining whether the potential network participant meets the requirements and recommendations determined by the parameters associated with the networked business process. If the potential network participant does not meet one or more of the required parameters or meets the required parameters but fails to provide a satisfactory number or percentage of the preferred parameters the participant profile analyzer may deny or reject an attempt to on board or add the potential network participant to the networked business process.

If a current or potential network participant is not associated with a network participant profile the participant profile generator can be used to generate or create the corresponding profile. In some instances the participant profile generator may receive information from a representative associated with the current or potential network participant with regard to the capabilities of the network participant s network participant server or its associated local business process . The participant profile generator may also be capable of automatically deriving information about the capabilities of a network participant and its local business process based on metadata associated with the network participant or process as well as based on information from one or more other network participants that have previously interacted with the network participant or process. Additionally the participant profile generator may import an already generated profile from another system or environment such as another set of cloud based services and information not associated with the illustrated system .

In the present example the potential network participant server D includes a local business process and a local network participant profile . The potential network participant server D and its local business process are being added to the networked business process defined by the interactions between the other network participant servers and . After analyzing the potential participant s network participant profile the network participant profile module via its participant profile analyzer allows the on boarding of the new network participant and process. In alternative implementations the new network participant and process may be used to replace a current network participant that fails to perform at a certain level or threshold as determined by the system administrator networked business process designer or based on certain performance indicators or service level agreements. In those instances the potential network participant server D can replace one of the current network participants. In either event once added arrow indicates the communications performed between the potential network participant server D and the other network participant servers via the set of cloud based services and information .

At a profile for a proposed or potential new network participant to be added to the networked business process is identified. The proposed new network participant may be previously associated with a network participant profile defining a set of capabilities associated with the participant and any local business process associated therewith. In other instances a profile associated with the proposed new network participant may be generated either manually or automatically as described above.

At a set of criteria required and or preferred for network participants and processes associated with the networked business process is identified. The set of criteria may include one or more required capabilities or quality of services to be provided by the network participants as well as various preferred capabilities or quality of services. In some instances a particular rating or threshold value associated with the set of criteria may be defined where the rating or threshold value is based on a known algorithm used to calculate the relative level of the quality of services provided by a network participant within the networked business process that is necessary for transparency and communication purposes.

At the identified network participant profile for the proposed or potential new network participant is analyzed based on the identified set of criteria. In some instances analyzing the profile may include a determination as to whether the required parameters from the set of criteria are met by the profile. Additionally analyzing the profile may include a calculation based on the known algorithm providing a rating or value defining the relative correspondence of the network participant profile to the identified set of criteria. The rating or value provides an objectively derived number defining the level of correspondence between the profile and the set of criteria.

At a determination is made as to whether the identified network participant profile meets the set of criteria or exceeds a threshold value defined thereby associated with the networked business process. If one or more of the required criteria are not provided by the capabilities defined by the identified network participant profile method continues to . Additionally if the required criteria are met but the calculated rating or value of the network participant profile fails to meet or exceed the threshold value defined in the parameters associated with the networked business process method may also continue at . At the addition of the proposed network participant to the networked business process is denied. If however the network participant profile meets the required capabilities and exceeds the minimum threshold method continues at where the addition of the proposed network participant and its associated business processes to the networked business process is allowed by the network participant profile module.

At a current network participant in the networked business process is identified for replacement. The identified network participant may be replaced for any number of reasons including failure to meet certain performance criteria e.g. as determined by a centralized monitoring system as described above a desire to reduce costs associated with the networked business process or general design decisions and modifications. For purposes of description in method the identified network participant is being removed for failure to perform to adequate standards although the functionality performed by the identified network participant is to remain within the networked business process.

At a set of criteria required and or preferred for network participants and processes associated with the networked business process is identified. The operation of may be performed as described in of although other suitable operations may also be used. At a set of potential network participants for replacing the functionality of the current network participant from is identified. In some instances this action may include searching a set of network participant profiles to determine at least one potential network participant with functionality identical or similar to the functionality provided by the to be replaced network participant. Any suitable method of determining the set of at least one potential network participant with the appropriate functionality may be used. For example a search engine or other network participant identification tool may be employed. In some instances a network participant already included in the networked business process may be included in the set.

At a network participant profile associated with a potential replacement network participant from the identified set is analyzed based on the set of criteria associated with the networked business process. The analysis operations of may be similar to those performed at of method as well as other suitable analyses and comparisons of the capabilities of the potential replacement network participant.

At a determination is made as to whether the potential replacement network participant s profile meets the set of criteria or exceeds a threshold value defined by the criteria associated with the networked business process. If one or more of the required criteria are not provided by the capabilities defined by the potential replacement network participant s profile or if the required criteria are met but the calculated rating or value of the potential replacement network participant s profile fails to meet or exceed the minimum threshold value defined by the criteria method continues at . At the potential replacement network participant profile is removed from the set of potential network participant replacements. If however the potential replacement network participant s profile meets the required capabilities and exceeds the minimum threshold value of the criteria method continues at . At the potential replacement network participant is retained within the set of potential network participant replacements and method continues at .

At a determination is made as to whether any additional and yet to be analyzed potential replacement network participant profiles remain in the set of potential replacement network participants identified at . If additional profiles remain to be analyzed method returns to where the next profile is analyzed. If however no additional profiles remain method moves to .

At the set of potential network participant replacements as determined by and is sorted. In some instances sorting the set of potential network participant replacements may include sorting according to a rating or value determined by the analysis at . The sort may alternatively or additionally be based on any particular profile information or capabilities identified within the profile. For example the set of potential network participant replacements can be sorted by one or more of the following whether the potential replacement network participant can publish information associated with start and or end events intermediate events and milestones and error events and whether the potential replacement network participant can provide support for business process termination business process compensation and or ad hoc modification to a business process. Any other suitable sort methodology or criteria can also be used including the cost to add a particular potential network participant to the networked business process. At the sorted set of potential network participant profiles is returned or in some instances presented. The sorted set of potential replacements can be presented via a GUI associated with an administrator or business process designer allowing the replacement network participant to be selected at . The selected replacement network participant and its associated business process can then be added to the networked business process with the replaced network participant and its associated business process being removed from the networked business process.
