In another aspect presented herein are methods for identifying receptor ligand interactions.

Activation of T cells is an important aspect of the immune system. T cell activation is required for specific immune responses against infectious agents. T cell activation also plays an important role in tumor immunity and in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. T cell activation is initiated when T cell antigen receptors TCR of T cells recognize their specific antigen Ag in the context of major histocompatibility complex MHC molecules. Although TCR signal transduction is required for naive T cell activation TCR activation alone is not sufficient to generate an immune response. A secondary signal known as costimulation is needed for optimal activation of naive T cells. In particular signal transduction through the TCR and CD28 known as a costimulatory receptor are required for activation of naive T cells. B7 1 CD80 and B7 2 CD86 known as costimulatory molecules are two ligands for CD28. B7 1 and B7 2 are typically expressed on professional antigen presenting cells APCs . In addition to binding CD28 B7 1 and B7 2 also bind to the co stimulatory receptor known as CTLA 4 CD152 on T cells. Another co stimulatory receptor found on T cells is ICOS.

B7 molecules mediate both positive and negative signals to T cells by binding to costimulatory receptors on T cells. CD28 is the most extensively studied receptor that accepts a secondary signal from B7 1 CD80 and B7 2 CD86 B70 to costimulate naive T cells to full activation in the presence of T cell receptor signaling Linsley et all 1990 PNAS USA 87 5031 5035 . On the other hand CTLA 4 a CD28 homolog expressed on activated T cells and interacting with the same set of ligands attenuates T cell responses Krummel et al. 1995 J. Exp. Med. 182 469 465 Walnus et al. 1994 Immunity 1 405 413 . ICOS another CD28 homolog is expressed on activated T cells and costimulates 1 cell activation upon binding of a distinct ligand B7 H2 ICOSLG GL50 B7RP1 CD275 ICOSL LICOS Hutloff et al. 1999 Nature 397 263 266 Yoshinaga et al. 1999 Nature 402 827 832 . CD28 CTLA 4 and ICOS form a tight gene cluster on human chromosome 2q33 and on mouse chromosome 1 suggesting they originated by gene duplication during evolution Swallow et al. 1999 Immunity 11 423 432 . Although CD28 and ICOS have distinct ligands they share significant functional redundancy including their capacity in costimulating growth survival and differentiation of T cells as well as their requirement for antibody response Ling et al. 2000 J. Immunol. 164 1653 1657 Ling et al. 2001 Genomics 78 155 168 Dong et al. 2001 Nature 409 97 101 McAdam et al. 2001 Nature 409 102 105 Tafuri et al. 2001 Nature 409 105 109 Linterman et al. 2009 Immunity 30 228 241 . Both CD28 and ICOS signals have been shown to costimulate an array of cytokines. However only CD28 signal induces high level of IL 2 while ICOS preferentially stimulates IL 10 Hutloff et al. 1999 Nature 397 263 266 .

The antibodies described herein can be affinity matured using techniques known to one of skill in the art. The monoclonal antibodies described herein can be chimerized using techniques known to one of skill in the art. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 1985 Science 229 1202 Oi et al. 1986 BioTechniques 4 214 Gillies et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 4 816 397 and 6 331 415 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The monoclonal antibodies described herein can be humanized. A humanized antibody is an antibody which is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which comprises a framework region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non human immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains Fab Fab F ab 2 Fv in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin i.e. donor antibody and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Ordinarily the antibody will contain both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CH1 hinge CH2 CH3 and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins including IgM IgG IgD IgA and IgE and any isotype including IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. Usually the constant domain is a complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity and the class is typically IgG1. Where such cytotoxic activity is not desirable the constant domain may be of the IgG2 class. Examples of VL and VH constant domains that can be used in certain embodiments include but are not limited to C kappa and C gamma 1 nG1m described in Johnson et al. 1997 J. Infect. Dis. 176 1215 1224 and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 307. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art. The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences e.g. the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the import antibody. Such mutations however will not be extensive. Usually at least 75 of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework FR and CDR sequences more often 90 and most preferably greater than 95 . Humanized antibodies can be produced using variety of techniques known in the art including but not limited to CDR grafting European Patent No. EP 239 400 International publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat.

No. US 2005 0042664 A1 Feb. 24 2005 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Often framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions.

In one aspect antibodies presented herein are modified to have an extended or increased half life in vivo. In one embodiment presented herein are antibodies which have a half life in a subject preferably a mammal and most preferably a human of from about 3 days to about 180 days or more and in some embodiments greater than 3 days greater than 7 days greater than 10 days greater than 15 days greater than 20 days greater than 25 days greater than 30 days greater than 35 days greater than 40 days greater than 45 days greater than 50 days at least about 60 days greater than 75 days greater than 90 days greater than 105 days greater than 120 days greater than 135 days greater than 150 days greater than 165 days or greater than 180 days.

In a specific embodiment modified antibodies having an increased half life in vivo are generated by introducing one or more amino acid modifications i.e. substitutions insertions or deletions into an IgG constant domain or FcRn binding fragment thereof preferably a Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment . See e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 02 060919 WO 98 23289 and WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a specific embodiment the antibodies may have one or more amino acid modifications in the second constant domain i.e. the CH2 domain at e.g. residues 231 340 of human IgG1 and or the third constant domain i.e. the CH3 domain at e.g. residues 341 447 of human IgG1 with numbering according to the Kabat numbering system e.g. the EU index in Kabat .

In some embodiments to prolong the in vivo serum circulation of antibodies inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol PEG are attached to the antibodies with or without a multifunctional linker either through site specific conjugation of the PEG to the N or C terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody PEG conjugates by size exclusion or by ion exchange chromatography. PEG derivatized antibodies can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods well known to those of skill in the art for example by immunoassays described herein.

In another embodiment antibodies are conjugated to albumin in order to make the antibody more stable in vivo or have a longer half life in vivo. The techniques are well known in the art see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 93 15199 WO 93 15200 and WO 01 77137 and European Patent No. EP 413 622 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments antibodies are conjugated or recombinantly fused to a diagnostic detectable or therapeutic agent or any other molecule. When in vivo half life is desired to be increased said antibodies can be modified. The conjugated or recombinantly fused antibodies can be useful e.g. in detecting tissues or cells that express B7 H7 polypeptide or B7 H7CR polypeptide. In a specific embodiment a method for detecting B7 H7 expressing cells or tissue comprises contacting an antibody that specifically binds to B7 H7 with cells or tissues of a subject and detecting the cells or tissues to which the antibody binds. In a specific embodiment a method for detecting B7 H7CR expressing cells or tissue comprises contacting an antibody that specifically binds to B7 H7CR with cells or tissues of subject and detecting the cells or tissues to which the antibody binds. In accordance with such embodiments the antibody can be conjugated to a detectable moiety and the binding of an antibody to cells or tissues can be detected by detecting the presence of the detectably moiety. Alternatively the binding of the antibody to cells or tissues can be detected by detecting using a labeled secondary antibody that binds to the antibody and detecting the presence of the labeled secondary antibody. In certain embodiments after cells or tissue are incubated with the appropriate antibody unbound antibody is removed by one or more washes prior to detecting the cells or tissue to which the antibody is bound. In some embodiments the methods for detecting B7 H7 or B7 H7CR expressing cells or tissues includes the use of positive and or negative controls. For example cells or tissues known to express B7 H7 or B7 H7CR can be used in the methods as a positive control and cells or tissues known not to express B7 H7 or B7 H7CR can be used in the methods as a negative control. Examples of detectable moieties include but not limited to various enzymes such as but not limited to horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase or acetylcholinesterase prosthetic groups such as but not limited to streptavidin biotin and avidin biotin fluorescent materials such as but not limited to umbelliferone fluorescein fluorescein isothiocynate rhodamine dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin luminescent materials such as but not limited to luminol bioluminescent materials such as but not limited to luciferase luciferin and acquorin radioactive materials such as but not limited to iodine I I I and I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In In In and In technetium Tc thallium Ti gallium Ga Ga palladium Pd molybdenum Mo xenon Xe fluorine F Sm Lu Gd Pm La Yb Ho Y Sc Re Re Pr Rh Ru Ge Co Zn Sr P Gd Yb Cr Mn Se Sn and Sn and positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies and non radioactive paramagnetic metal ions.

In particular provided herein are fusion proteins comprising an antigen binding fragment of a monoclonal antibody e.g. a Fab fragment Fd fragment Fv fragment F ab fragment a VH domain a VH CDR a VL domain or a VL CDR and a heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide. In a specific embodiment the heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide that the antibody is fused to is useful for targeting the antibody to a particular cell type.

Encompassed herein are uses of the antibodies conjugated or recombinantly fused to a therapeutic moiety or drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic moieties or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents.

Such proteins may include for example interferon interferon interferon interleukin 2 IL 2 interleukin 7 IL 7 interleukin 9 IL 9 interleukin 10 IL 10 interleukin 12 IL 12 interleukin 15 IL 15 interleukin 23 IL 23 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF or a growth factor. The therapeutic moiety or drug conjugated or recombinantly fused to an antibody should be chosen to achieve the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect s . A clinician or other medical personnel should consider the following when deciding on which therapeutic moiety or drug to conjugate or recombinantly fuse to an antibody the nature of the disease the severity of the disease and the condition of the subject.

Moreover antibodies can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the hemagglutinin HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the Influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al. 1984 Cell 37 767 and the flag tag.

Nucleic acid constructs also may comprise one or more post transcriptional regulatory element s operably linked to the coding sequence of a protein. The post transcriptional regulatory elements can be 5 and or 3 to the coding sequence and direct the post transcriptional regulation of the translation of RNA transcripts encoding a protein.

In another aspect the nucleic acid construct can be a gene targeting vector that replaces a gene s existing regulatory region with a regulatory sequence isolated from a different gene or a novel regulatory sequence as described e.g. in International Publication Nos. WO 94 12650 and WO 01 68882 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The nucleic acid construct chosen will depend upon a variety of factors including without limitation the strength of the transcriptional regulatory elements and the cell to be used to express a protein. The nucleic acid constructs can be a plasmid phagemid cosmid viral vector phage artificial chromosome and the like. In one aspect the vectors can be episomal non homologously or homologously integrating vectors which can be introduced into the appropriate cells by any suitable means transformation transfection conjugation protoplast fusion electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation direct microinjection etc. to transform them.

The nucleic acid constructs can be a plasmid or a stable integration vector for transient or stable expression of a protein in cells. For stable expression the vector can mediate chromosomal integration at a target site or a random chromosomal site. Non limiting examples of cell vector systems that may be used to express a protein include mammalian cell systems infected with virus e.g. vaccinia virus adenovirus retroviruses lentiviruses etc. insect cell systems infected with virus e.g. baculovirus microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA and stable cell lines generated by transformation using a selectable marker. In some embodiments the nucleic acid constructs include a selectable marker gene including but not limited to neo gpt dhfr ada pac hyg CAD and hisD.

The nucleic acid constructs can be monocistronic or multicistronic. A multicistronic nucleic acid construct may encode 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more or in the range of 2 5 5 10 or 10 20 genes nucleotide sequences. For example a bicistronic nucleic acid construct may comprise in the following order a promoter a first gene and a second gene. In such a nucleic acid construct the transcription of both genes is driven by the promoter whereas the translation of the mRNA from the first gene is by a cap dependent scanning mechanism and the translation of the mRNA from the second gene is by a cap independent mechanism e.g. by an IRES.

In a specific embodiment reference to a cell transfected with nucleic acids includes the particular subject cell transfected with the nucleic acids and the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Progeny of such a cell may not be identical to the parent cell transfected with the nucleic acid molecule due to mutations or environmental influences that may occur in succeeding generations or integration of the nucleic acid molecule into the cell genome.

In some embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is a compound that modulates the interaction between B7 H7 and B7 H7CR. In other embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is a compound that modulates the expression of B7 H7 or B7 H7CR. In specific embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is an Immunostimulating Therapeutic Agent. In other specific embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is an Inhibitory Therapeutic Agent. Examples of compounds include but are not limited to peptides proteins peptoids random biooligomers diversomers such as hydantoins benzodiazepines dipeptides vinylogous polypeptides nonpeptidal peptidomimetics oligocarbamates peptidyl phosphonates nucleic acids e.g. RNAi antisense and microRNA antibodies and carbohydrates. In a specific embodiment a Therapeutic Agent is a small molecule.

In certain embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is an antisense nucleic acid molecule that inhibits or reduces the expression of B7 H7 or B7 H7CR. An antisense molecule can hydrogen bond to a sense nucleic acid. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire coding strand or to only a fragment thereof e.g. all or part of the protein coding region or open reading frame . An antisense nucleic acid molecule can be antisense to all or part of a non coding region of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein. The non coding regions 5 and 3 untranslated regions are the 5 and 3 sequences which flank the coding region and are not translated into amino acids.

An antisense nucleic acid molecule can be for example about 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 or 50 or 5 to 25 5 to 50 10 to 25 10 to 50 15 to 25 15 to 50 20 to 30 20 to 40 20 to 50 25 to 40 or 25 to 50 nucleotides or more in length. An antisense nucleic acid molecule can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example an antisense nucleic acid e.g. an antisense oligonucleotide can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids e.g. phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. Examples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid molecule include 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xanthine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil beta D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil beta D mannosylqueosine 5 methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 N 2 carboxypropyl uracil acp3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine. Alternatively the antisense nucleic acid can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned in an antisense orientation i.e. RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest described further in the following subsection . Techniques for generating antisense nucleic acid molecules are known to those skilled in the art.

In some embodiments a Therapeutic Agent is a ribozyme that is specific for B7 H7 or B7 H7CR nucleic acids. Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules with ribonuclease activity which are capable of cleaving a single stranded nucleic acid such as an mRNA to which they have a complementary region. Thus ribozymes e.g. hammerhead ribozymes described in Haselhoff and Gerlach 1988 Nature 334 585 591 can be used to catalytically cleave mRNA transcripts to thereby inhibit translation of the protein encoded by the mRNA. A ribozyme having specificity for a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide can be designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA disclosed herein. For example a derivative of a Tetrahymena L 19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved in a Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 987 071 and Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 116 742. Alternatively an mRNA encoding a polypeptide can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See e.g. Bartel and Szostak 1993 Science 261 1411 1418.

The immunostimulatory molecules B7 1 and B7 2 which bind to the inducible inhibitory CTLA 4 receptor with higher affinity than the constitutive stimulatory CD28 receptor. Therefore B7 1 and B7 2 initially stimulate immune responses via CD28 but later inhibit of immune responses via CTLA 4 which prevents over stimulation of the immune system. In contrast B7 H2 has a relatively low affinity for CTLA 4 compared to CD28 and ICOS. Therefore an agonistic B7 H2 polypeptide or fusion thereof e.g. B7 H2 Ig may be very useful for producing sustained immune responses through CD28 a constitutive receptor and ICOS an inducible receptor for treating chronic cancers and infections and to help generate memory responses. In addition an agonistic B7 H2 polypeptide or fusion thereof e.g. B7 H2 Ig maybe a very good adjuvant for other therapeutics relying on immune stimulation such as vaccines against cancers and infectious disease. The effects may be enhanced in combination of CTLA4 inhibitors e.g. anti CTLA4.

Both compartments are collected by removing the supernatant trypsinizing the attached cells and combining both preparations following a centrifugation wash step 10 minutes 2000 rpm . The protocol for treating tumor cell cultures with sulindac and related compounds to obtain a significant amount of apoptosis has been described in the literature see e.g. Piazza et al. 1995 Cancer Research 55 3110 16 . Features of this method include collecting both floating and attached cells identification of the optimal treatment times and dose range for observing apoptosis and identification of optimal cell culture conditions.

The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In some embodiments administration will result in the release of a Therapeutic Agent into the bloodstream.

In specific embodiments it may be desirable to administer a Therapeutic Agent locally. This may be achieved for example and not by way of limitation by local infusion topical application e.g. in conjunction with a wound dressing by injection by means of a catheter by means of a suppository or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers.

In another embodiment a Therapeutic Agent is delivered in a controlled release system See e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . Examples of controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer 1990 Science 249 1527 1533 may be used. In one embodiment a pump may be used See Langer supra Sefton 1987 CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 Buchwald et al. 1980 Surgery 88 507 Saudek et al. 1989 N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used See Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 Controlled Drug Bioavailability Drug Product Design and Performance Smolen and Ball eds. Wiley New York 1984 Ranger and Peppas 1983 J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23 61 See also Levy et al. 1985 Science 228 190 During et al. 1989 Ann. Neurol. 25 351 Howard et al. 1989 J. Neurosurg. 71 105 . In a specific embodiment a controlled release system comprising a Therapeutic Agent is placed in close proximity to the tissue affected by the disease to be prevented treated and or managed. In accordance with this embodiment the close proximity of the controlled release system to the affected tissue may result in only a fraction of the dose of the Therapeutic Agent required if it is systemically administered.

The amount of a Therapeutic Agent or the amount of a composition comprising a Therapeutic Agent that will be effective in the prevention treatment and or management of a disease can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend e.g. on the route of administration the type of symptoms and the seriousness of the symptoms and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s or subject s circumstances.

In some embodiments the dosage of a Therapeutic Agent or compositions thereof is determined by extrapolating from the no observed adverse effective level NOAEL as determined in animal studies. This extrapolated dosage is useful in determining the maximum recommended starting dose for human clinical trials. For instance the NOAELs can be extrapolated to determine human equivalent dosages HED . Typically HED is extrapolated from a non human animal dosage based on the doses that are normalized to body surface area i.e. mg m2 . In specific embodiments the NOAELs are determined in mice hamsters rats ferrets guinea pigs rabbits dogs primates primates monkeys marmosets squirrel monkeys baboons micropigs or minipigs. For a discussion on the use of NOAELs and their extrapolation to determine human equivalent doses See Guidance for Industry Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER Pharmacology and Toxicology July 2005. In one embodiment a Therapeutic Agent or composition thereof is administered at a dose that is lower than the human equivalent dosage HED of the NOAEL over a period of 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 1 month 2 months three months four months six months nine months 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years or more.

In certain embodiments a dosage regime for a human subject can be extrapolated from animal model studies using the dose at which 10 of the animals die LD10 . In general the starting dose of a Phase I clinical trial is based on preclinical testing. A standard measure of toxicity of a drug in preclinical testing is the percentage of animals that die because of treatment. It is well within the skill of the art to correlate the LD10 in an animal study with the maximal tolerated dose MTD in humans adjusted for body surface area as a basis to extrapolate a starting human dose. In some embodiments the interrelationship of dosages for one animal model can be converted for use in another animal including humans using conversion factors based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface as described e.g. in Freireich et al. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1966 50 219 244. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See e.g. Scientific Tables Geigy Pharmaceuticals Ardley N.Y. 1970 537. In certain embodiments the adjustment for body surface area includes host factors such as for example surface area weight metabolism tissue distribution absorption rate and excretion rate. In addition the route of administration excipient usage and the specific disease or virus to target are also factors to consider. In one embodiment the standard conservative starting dose is about 1 10 the murine LD10 although it may be even lower if other species i.e. dogs were more sensitive to the Therapeutic Agent. In other embodiments the standard conservative starting dose is about 1 100 1 95 1 90 1 85 1 80 1 75 1 70 1 65 1 60 1 55 1 50 1 45 1 40 1 35 1 30 1 25 1 20 1 15 2 10 3 10 4 10 or 5 10 of the murine LD10. In other embodiments an starting dose amount of a Therapeutic Agent in a human is lower than the dose extrapolated from animal model studies. In another embodiment an starting dose amount of a Therapeutic Agent in a human is higher than the dose extrapolated from animal model studies. It is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the active composition at relatively low levels and increase or decrease the dosage as necessary to achieve the desired effect with minimal toxicity.

The dosages of prophylactic or therapeutic agents which have been or are currently used for the prevention treatment and or management of a disease or disorder such as e.g. cancer infectious disease autoimmune and inflammatory disease and transplant rejection can be determined using references available to a clinician such as e.g. the Physicians Desk Reference 63rd ed. 2009 . Preferably dosages lower than those which have been or are currently being used to prevent treat and or manage the disease or disorder are utilized in combination with one or more Therapeutic Agents or compositions thereof.

The above described administration schedules are provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered limiting. A person of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that all doses are within the scope of the invention.

Therapeutic Agents that specifically bind to the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 can be assessed using any method well known in the art e.g. ELISA coimmunoprecipitation Biacore assays and KinEx A assays.

Binding assays can be used to determine the binding affinity of a Therapeutic Agent for B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. Binding assays may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay a Therapeutic Agent is tested for binding to the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4.

Competition binding assays on the other hand assess the ability of a Therapeutic Agent to compete with a known agent e.g. antibodies or other compound that binds to B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4.

In a direct binding assay B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 is contacted with a Therapeutic Agent under conditions that allow binding of the Therapeutic Agent to the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. The binding may take place in solution or on a solid surface. Preferably the candidate antibody is previously labeled for detection. Any detectable compound may be used for labeling such as but not limited to a luminescent fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same or a nonisotopic label such as an enzyme or dye. After a period of incubation sufficient for binding to take place the reaction is exposed to conditions and manipulations that remove excess or non specifically bound antibody. Typically it involves washing with an appropriate buffer. Finally the presence of a Therapeutic Agent bound to B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 is detected.

In a competition binding assay a Therapeutic Agent is evaluated for its ability to inhibit or displace the binding of a known agent e.g. an antibody other compound to the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. A labeled known binder of B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 may be mixed and placed under conditions in which the interaction between them would normally occur with and without the addition of the Therapeutic Agent. The amount of labeled known binder that binds the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 may be compared to the amount bound in the presence or absence of the Therapeutic Agent.

In one embodiment the binding assay is carried out with one or more components immobilized on a solid surface to facilitate antibody antigen complex formation and detection. In various embodiments the solid support could be but is not restricted to polycarbonate polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene glass nitrocellulose dextran nylon polyacrylamide and agarose. The support configuration can include beads membranes microparticles the interior surface of a reaction vessel such as a microtiter plate test tube or other reaction vessel. The immobilization of B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 or other component can be achieved through covalent or non covalent attachments. In one embodiment the attachment may be indirect i.e. through an attached antibody. In another embodiment the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 and negative controls are tagged with an epitope such as glutathione S transferase GST so that the attachment to the solid surface can be mediated by a commercially available antibody such as anti GST Santa Cruz Biotechnology .

For example such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 which is immobilized to a solid support. Typically the non mobilized component of the binding reaction in this case the Therapeutic Agent is labeled to enable detection. A variety of labeling methods are available and may be used such as luminescent chromophore fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same and nonisotopic labels such as enzymes or dyes. In one embodiment the Therapeutic Agent is labeled with a fluorophore such as fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC available from Sigma Chemicals St. Louis . Such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 immobilized on a solid surface. Therapeutic Agents are then incubated with the B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 and the specific binding of Therapeutic Agents is detected by methods known in the art including but not limited to BiaCore Analyses ELISA FMET and RIA methods.

Finally the label remaining on the solid surface may be detected by any detection method known in the art. For example if the Therapeutic Agent is labeled with a fluorophore a fluorimeter may be used to detect complexes.

In one embodiment the Therapeutic Agent is added to intact cells that express B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 or isolated membranes containing B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. Thus direct binding of Therapeutic Agent may be assayed in intact cells in culture or in animal models. A labeled Therapeutic Agent may be mixed with cells that express B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 or with crude extracts obtained from such cells. Isolated membranes may be used to identify Therapeutic Agents that interact with B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. For example in a typical experiment using isolated membranes cells may be genetically engineered to express B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4. Membranes can be harvested by standard techniques and used in an in vitro binding assay. Labeled Therapeutic Agent e.g. fluorescent labeled antibody is bound to the membranes and assayed for specific activity specific binding is determined by comparison with binding assays performed in the presence of excess unlabeled cold Therapeutic Agent. Alternatively soluble B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4 may be recombinantly expressed and utilized in non cell based assays to identify Therapeutic Agents that bind to B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4.

Alternatively the binding reaction may be carried out in solution. In this assay the labeled component is allowed to interact with its binding partner s in solution. If the size differences between the labeled component and its binding partner s permit such a separation the separation can be achieved by passing the products of the binding reaction through an ultrafilter whose pores allow passage of unbound labeled component but not of its binding partner s or of labeled component bound to its partner s . Separation can also be achieved using any reagent capable of capturing a binding partner of the labeled component from solution such as an antibody against the binding partner and so on.

Various methods described above or known in the art can be adapted to assay the binding affinity of a Therapeutic Agent for B7 H7 B7 H7CR B7 H2 ICOS CD28 CTLA 4 or a complex of B7 H7 and B7 H7CR or B7 H2 and either ICOS CD28 or CTLA 4.

Various assays known in the art can be used to assess whether a Therapeutic Agent activates enhances suppresses or reduces immune function. In one aspect the Therapeutic Agent increases an immune response that can be e.g. an antibody response humoral response or a cellular immune response e.g. cytokine secretion e.g. interferon gamma helper activity or cellular cytotoxicity. In one embodiment the increased immune response is increased cytokine secretion antibody production effector function T cell proliferation and or NK cell proliferation. In another aspect the Therapeutic Agent suppresses an immune response that can be e.g. an antibody response humoral response or a cellular immune response e.g. cytokine secretion e.g. interferon gamma helper activity or cellular cytotoxicity. In one embodiment the decreased immune response is decreased cytokine secretion antibody production effector function T cell proliferation and or NK cell proliferation. Various assays to measure such activities are well known in the art and exemplary descriptions of such assays are provided below.

Proliferation of certain immune cells may assessed by H thymidine incorporation. The tetramer staining assay Altman et al. 1996 Science 274 94 96 may be used to identify antigen specific T cells and to assess how Therapeutic Agents modulate e.g. activate enhance reduce or suppress antigen specific T cell responses. For example an MHC molecule containing a specific peptide antigen such as a tumor specific antigen is multimerized to make soluble peptide tetramers and labeled for example by complexing to streptavidin. The MHC peptide antigen complex is then mixed with a population of T cells obtained from a subject administered with an immunogenic composition alone or in combination with a Therapeutic Agent. Biotin is then used to stain T cells which express the tumor specific antigen of interest.

Furthermore using the mixed lymphocyte target culture assay the cytotoxicity of T cells can be tested in a Cr release assay as described e.g. in Palladino et al. 1987 Cancer Res. 47 5074 5079. Briefly the mixed lymphocyte culture is added to a target cell suspension to give different effector target E T ratios usually 1 1 to 40 1 . The target cells are pre labeled by incubating 1 10target cells in culture medium containing 500 Ci of Cr per ml for one hour at 37 C. The cells are washed three times following labeling. Each assay point E T ratio is performed in triplicate and the appropriate controls incorporated to measure spontaneous Cr release no lymphocytes added to assay and 100 release cells lysed with detergent . After incubating the cell mixtures for 4 hours the cells are pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 minutes. The amount of Cr released into the supernatant is measured by a gamma counter. The percent cytotoxicity is measured as cpm in the test sample minus spontaneously released cpm divided by the total detergent released cpm minus spontaneously released cpm.

An ELISPOT assay can be used to measure cytokine release in vitro by T cells after administration of an effective amount of a Therapeutic Agent to a subject. Cytokine release is detected by antibodies which are specific for a particular cytokine e.g. interleukin 2 tumor necrosis factor or interferon see e.g. Scheibenbogen et al. 1997 Int. J. Cancer 71 932 936 . The assay is carried out in a microtitre plate which has been pre coated with an antibody specific for a cytokine of interest which captures the cytokine secreted by T cells. After incubation of T cells for 24 48 hours in the coated wells the T cells are removed and replaced with a second labeled antibody that recognizes a different epitope on the cytokine. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibody an enzyme substrate which produces a colored reaction product is added to the plate. The number of cytokine producing cells is counted under a microscope. This method has the advantages of short assay time and sensitivity without the need of a large number of cytotoxic T cells.

In specific embodiments the assays described in Examples 6 and 7 infra may be used to assess the affect of a Therapeutic Agent on immune function. For example the affect of a Therapeutic Agent on immune function can be assessed using the T cell costimulation assay described in Examples 6 and 7 infra.

The toxicity and or efficacy of the therapies described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 ED50. Therapies that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While therapies that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in the method e.g. as described herein the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 i.e. the concentration of the Therapeutic Agent that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

In certain embodiments the cytotoxicity of a Therapeutic Agent can be determined by measuring the level of apoptosis of cells in a cell culture exposed to the Therapeutic Agent. In one embodiment apoptosis can be quantitated by measuring DNA fragmentation. Commercial photometric methods for the quantitative in vitro determination of DNA fragmentation are available. Examples of such assays including TUNEL which detects incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA and ELISA based assays are described in Biochemica 1999 no. 2 pp. 34 37 Roche Molecular Biochemicals . In yet another embodiment apoptosis can be observed morphologically.

Cell lines on which such assays can be performed are well known to those of skill in the art. Apoptosis necrosis and proliferation assays can also be performed on primary cells e.g. a tissue explant.

Therapeutic Agents are preferably assayed in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example in one embodiment a Therapeutic Agent can be administered to the animal at the same time as the onset of a disease or disorder in the animal. In another embodiment a Therapeutic Agent can be administered to the animal prior to the onset of a disease or disorder in the animal. In another embodiment a Therapeutic Agent can be administered to the animal subsequent to the onset of a disease or disorder in the animal. In a specific embodiment the Therapeutic Agent is administered to the animal more than one time. In another specific embodiment the Therapeutic Agent is administered in combination with another therapy.

Therapeutic Agents can be tested in animal models systems including but are not limited to rats mice chicken cows monkeys pigs goats sheep dogs rabbits guinea pigs etc. In a specific embodiment Therapeutic Agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well known to the skilled artisan. In a specific embodiment Therapeutic Agents are tested in knockout animals for restoration of function. For example a B7 H2 knockout may be used to test for restoration of certain B7 H2 related functions by certain Therapeutic Agents.

The anti cancer activity of the Therapeutic Agent can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer well known in the art as described in e.g. Relevance of Tumor Models for Anticancer Drug Development 1999 eds. Fiebig and Burger Contributions to Oncology 1999 Karger The Nude Mouse in Oncology Research 1991 eds. Boven and Winograd and Anticancer Drug Development Guide 1997 ed. Teicher incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Protein interactions were measured and analyzed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument BIAcore AB Uppsala Sweden performed at 25 C. as described previously 3 . 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl 0.005 surfactant P20 HBS was used as running buffer.

Another activated flow cell on the same chip which did not receive any fusion protein was used as a control sensor surface. The remaining activated carboxyl groups were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5 . Subsequently the flow cells were extensively washed with HBS to generate a stable baseline. Analytes ICOSIg CD28Ig and CTLA4Ig in serial dilutions were injected over the sensor surface in triplicates at a flow rate of 20 30 l min for 3 min and then the dissociation was allowed for 5 min.

Plasma membrane receptors on immune cells are evolved to mediate broad biological functions including detection of pathogens cell adhesion antigen recognition and transmission of extracellular signals into cells. Therefore interactions between immune receptors and their ligands or counter receptor are pivotal for cell communication and integration leading to execution of immune responses. By searching human genome databases more than 3 000 unique DNA sequences which encode hydrophilic extracellular domain and hydrophobic transmembrane domain are predicted to be capable of encoding cell membrane proteins 4 5 . However less than 500 proteins have been identified as counter receptors and this is largely due to limitation of sensitive methods. Many cell surface proteins or their mRNA are in low abundance and their expressions varies according to environmental cues. In addition the majority of cell surface molecular interactions are in fast on and fast off mode with weak affinity. While this feature allows maximal control of signaling and their effect in immune responses it increases the difficulty to identify the interactions by current methods including expression cloning and protein micro sequencing.

Over 1 900 full length human transmembrane genes have been obtained based on their expression on hematopoietic cells Table 1 . These genes include the molecules from immunoglobulin superfamily IgSF tumor necrosis factor superfamily TNFRSF C type lectin superfamily G protein coupled receptor GPCR superfamily as well as the majority of lectins integrins and scavenger receptors. By transfection of individual plasmids into 293T cells in 384 well plates high level expression of genes in 50 70 of 293T cells from randomly selected samples in this proteome was demonstrated. High level expression of individual proteins on the cell surface increases avidity of interaction with their counter receptors. For screening of an unknown counter receptor of a target protein the extracellular domain of the target gene is genetically fused to a tag gene mouse IgG2a Fc human IgG1 Fc FLAG or 6 HIS and the recombinant fusion protein which is generated by transient transfection of the plasmid into 293T cells is used for detection by binding to the proteome. Fluorescence labeled secondary antibody against the tag is applied to detect the binding of target protein to the proteome. The Applied Biosystem 8200 Cellular Detection System CDS was adapted for rapid screening of binding fluorescence activity . The CDS allows scanning of only the bottom of a microplate well at a depth of 100 m so as to ignore non binding secondary antibody resulting in a high signal to noise ratio eliminating all washing steps. Combining increased avidity interaction and a highly sensitive detection system enables the identification receptor ligand interactions which are undetectable on primary cells by other methods such as flow cytometry.

Molecules in the B7 CD28 family are found to modulate T cell receptor signals and play essential roles in the control of T cell mediated immune responses in positive and negative fashions 6 8 . CD28 was selected as a target protein to test the proteome system. CD28 delivers a costimulatory signal to naive T cells upon engaging one of two counter receptors B7 1 or B7 2 on professional antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells B cells and macrophages 9 . As expected recombinant human CD28Ig fusion proteins bound 293T cells which were transfected to express B7 1 CD80 or B7 2 CD86 B70 genes. The cells expressing Fc receptors were also positively stained due to human IgG1 Fc tag on CD28Ig. Unexpectedly CD28Ig was also found to bind 293T cells transfected with B7 H2 gene . B7 H2 ICOSL CD275 B7RP 1 is a B7 family molecule and was previously shown to be the ligand for inducible costimulator ICOS 7 . ICOS is a CD28 like molecule on activated T cells and is costimulatory for T cells upon binding B7 H2 to preferentially elicit Th2 mediated immune responses 10 11 . This binding was validated by flow cytometry analysis with positive staining of CD28Ig to B7 H2 293 cells and vice versa with B7 H2Ig staining of CD28 cells Importantly the binding of CD28Ig to B7 H2 293T cells could be selectively blocked by the inclusion of monoclonal antibody mAb against CD28 clone CD28.6 and mAb against B7 H2 clone MIH12 data not shown . Interestingly while a B7 H2 mAb clone 9F.8A4 could block binding of B7 H2Ig to both ICOS and CD28 another mAb clone MIH12 selectively abrogated the B7 H2 CD28 but not B7 H2 ICOS interactions indicating that B7 H2 utilizes non overlapping binding sites to interact with CD28 and ICOS. The results thus demonstrate the specificity of B7 H2 CD28 binding. Affinity comparison of B7 H2 to ICOS vs. CD28 by surface plasmon resonance SPR analysis shows that B7 H2 CD28 interaction has a significantly slow association Ka and a faster dissociation constants Kd to B7 H2 ICOS indicating that ICOS has higher affinity than CD28 for binding B7 H2. CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells while ICOS is inducible upon antigen stimulation 11 . These findings implicate a role of B7 H2 in the costimulation of naive T cells in addition to activated T cells.

CTLA 4 homologue of CD28 and similar to ICOS can be induced on T cells upon activation. Engagements of CTLA 4 by B7 1 and B7 2 are thought to deliver an inhibitory signal to down regulate T cell response to antigen 12 . CTLA4Ig was shown to also bind B7 H2 293 cells and the binding was largely eliminated by inclusion of a CTLA 4 mAb clone 14D3 which showed to block CTLA 4 and its ligands 13 . Conversely B7 H2Ig bound CTLA 4 293T cells and two B7 H2 mAbs clone MIH12 and 9F.8A4 which block B7 H2 CD28 binding also abrogated this binding E and . In comparison with B7 H2 ICOS B7 H2 CTLA 4 interaction has a much slower association and a faster dissociation . These results indicate that B7 H2 will preferentially interact with ICOS. Both ICOS and CTLA 4 are inducible receptors with similar expression kinetics upon activation 11 . This finding predicts that the major effect of B7 H2 on activated T cells will be those related to ICOS rather than CTLA 4. To determine if there are other interactions in currently discovered molecules of the B7 CD28 family the binding of these receptors and their counter receptors were screened using the proteomic system. As summarized in there are no additional interactions except further confirmation of B7 H2 binding to both CD28 and CTLA 4.

Comparison of binding B7 H2 to CTLA 4 vs. CD28 by SPR analysis indicates that B7 H2 CTLA 4 interaction has 4 fold less association Ka but similar dissociation rate Kd to B7 H2 CD28 indicating that B7 H2 has higher affinity to CD28 than CTLA 4 . This observation is in sharp contrast to B7 1 and B7 2 which bind CTLA 4 with much higher affinity 10 folds than CD28 14 implicating that B7 H2 is a non redundant ligand to B7 1 B7 2. To test this the ability of the B7 H2 CD28 interaction to be interfered by B7 1 B7 2 was determined. By flow cytometry saturated doses of B7 1Ig and B7 2Ig had only minimal effect on the binding of CD28Ig to B7 H2 293T cells supporting that B7 H2 interacts with a non overlapping site vs. B7 1 B7 2 on CD28 molecule . In contrast B7 1 and B7 2 are largely redundant in term of their interaction with CD28 and could compete each other for binding CD28 15 . These findings implicate a new feature of costimulation more than one structure on a costimulatory receptor is available for ligands to interact and this finding suggests that B7 H2 could costimulate naive T cells in synergy with B7 1 B7 2.

To further understand architecture of interactions between B7 H2 and its three receptors site directed mutagenesis was conducted to identify critical residues for these interactions. Selection of residues for mutation was based on their locations in the interfaces of B7 H2 ICOS interaction as predicted from crystal structure analysis 16 as shown in ribbon diagram . These residues were all converted to alanine a small aromatic amino acid to avoid a large overall structure modulation 16 . Wild type and mutated B7 H2 full length genes were transfected into 293 cells and the binding of these cells by CD28Ig CTLA 4Ig and ICOSIg were determined by flow cytometry analysis. All mutants which lost their binding to CD28 also do not interact with CTLA 4 indicating that B7 H2 binding sites for CD28 and CTLA 4 are largely overlapped i.e. CD28 and CTLA 4 should compete for the binding to B7 H2. Two mutants Y51A Y53A that lose their binding to ICOS also show significant decrease in their binding to CD28 and CTLA 4 . Interestingly two mutants L116A and F122A which largely retain the ability to bind ICOS have only minimal binding capacity to CD28 and CTLA 4. In the context of the finding that MIH12 mAb selectively blocked B7 H2 binding to CD28 and CTLA 4 but not ICOS these results support the notion that B7 H2 uses non identical but overlapping binding sites for interacting with ICOS and CD28 CTLA 4.

To demonstrate that the interaction of B7 H2 and CD28 is functional an in vitro costimulation assay was utilized in which suboptimal concentrations of plate bound human CD3 mAb were used as mimicry of a T cell receptor signal and B7 H2Ig was co immobilized in the same well to provide costimulation for purified human T cells. B7 H2Ig potently costimulated proliferation of na ve human T cells in this assay . Inclusion of blocking mAb either to CD28 clone CD28.6 non costimulatory or ICOS clone C398.4A non costimulatory partially but significantly reduced T cell proliferation whereas blockade of both ICOS and CD28 negated the majority of B7 H2 costimulatory effect This result indicates that the effect of B7 H2 mediated costimulation of T cells requires CD28 in addition to ICOS in this in vitro T cell proliferation assay. To exclude possible costimulation from B7 1 and B7 2 that could be upregulated on T cells both B7 1 and B7 2 were blocked by specific mAb in this assay. B7 H2Ig mediated costimulation was not affected by mAb to B7 1 B7 2 while this treatment inhibited T cell costimulation by B7 1Ig and B7 2Ig data not shown . The effect of B7 H2 specific mAb MIH12 is shown to selectively eliminate B7 H2 binding to CD28 CTLA 4 but not to ICOS . This treatment partially suppressed the B7 H2Ig mediated costimulation. Furthermore mAb 9F.8A4 which blocks B7 H2 binding to all three receptors completely abolished the effect of B7 H2Ig . All together these results support that B7 H2 is capable of costimulating T cell growth via CD28.

B7 H2 CD28 CTLA4 interactions add another layer of complexity to T cell costimulation. The non overlapping expression patterns of B7 H2 with B7 1 and B7 2 in the peripheral organs make it possible that three ligands could affect T cell responses through CD28 CTLA4 in spatially and timely divergent settings. Discovery of B7 H2 CD28 and B7 H2 CTLA4 interactions thus validated this proteomic system as a tool to discover novel interactions even among well studied molecules.

The use of this proteome system to identify the receptor for orphan ligands using B7 H7 as an example was explored. B7 H7 was previously described as human endogenous retrovirus H long terminal repeat associating protein 2 HHLA2 without identified biological function 17 though it was noted as a potential B7 family member by homolog search 18 . By comparison of its nucleotide and protein sequences its homology to other known human B7 members including B7 1 B7 2 B7 H1 B7 DC B7 H2 B7 H3 and B7 H4 with the highest homology to B7 H4 was demonstrated . Therefore assigned the gene name B7 H7 was assigned. The gene is located in chromosome 3q13.13 immediately adjacent to B7 1 and B7 2 and encodes a 414 amino acid long type I transmembrane protein with predicted molecular mass 45 KD. B7 H7 has 3 signature immunoglobulin Ig sets IgV IgC IgV in its extracellular domain and shares 20 homology in protein sequence with other B7 family molecules. B7 H7 also has an irregular intracellular domain without any significant homology to other B7 family molecules and no obvious motifs for signal transduction a signature of the B7 family molecules.

By screening the receptor ligand proteome with B7 H7Ig a B7 H7 binding partner called transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 2 TMIGD2 gene ID 126259 was identified . Similar to B7 H7 no function has been assigned for this gene. Herein this gene product was renamed the counter receptor for B7 H7 B7 H7CR . B7 H7CR is located in chromosome 19p13.3 and encodes a transmembrane protein with a single extracellular IgV domain and a long intracellular domain which is structurally similar to other known B7 family receptors. Notably the intracellular domain of B7 H7CR also contains three tyrosine residues which are potentially docking sites for signaling transduction. Overall B7 H7CR shares about 10 protein sequence homology with CD28 CTLA 4 ICOS and PD 1 . mAb specific to both human B7 H7 and B7 H7CR was generated. By transfection of 293T cells with B7 H7CR gene the expression of cell surface B7 H7CR by staining with anti B7 H7CR mAb clone 4 5 in flow cytometry analysis was demonstrated. B7 H7Ig strongly bound B7 H7CR 293T cells but not mock transfected cells . Similarly B7 H7CRIg also bound cells which were transfected with B7 H7 gene but not mock transfected cells. Inclusion of B7 H7 mAb clone 2D3 completely blocked this interaction . The potential cross reactivity between B7 H7CR to other known B7 family ligands was excluded by B7 H7CRIg staining of 293T cells transfected with human B7 1 B7 2 B7 H1 B7 DC B7 H2 B7 H3 both 2Ig and 4Ig forms and B7 H4 . These results thus indicate that B7 H7 specifically binds B7 H7CR and may represent a new pair in the B7 CD28 family.

B7 H7 mRNA is abundant in testis colon lung kidney and pancreas while it shows low levels in small intestine liver and skeletal muscle. In contrast B7 H7CR mRNA was mainly found in lymphoid organs thymus and spleen are the most abundant with peripheral blood lymphocyte PBL and liver showing second. Consistent to these findings no cell surface B7 H7 was detected by specific mAb on T B NK cells or neutrophils in human PBL . However macrophages derived from monocytes constantly expressed B7 H7 and activation of macrophages with LPS poly I C heat killed HKLM or interferon gamma further upregulated the expression . Monocyte derived immature dendritic cells DC could also be induced by poly I C or HKLM to express B7 H7. On the other hand B7 H7CR is constitutively expressed on the majority of T and NK cells but not on B cells . Taken together the expression patterns of B7 H7 and its counter receptor suggest their roles in the interaction of professional antigen presenting cells with T and NK cells.

A hallmark of the B7 family molecules is their capability to costimulate or coinhibit T cell responses in the presence of antigen 6 . The plate coated B7 H7Ig strongly promoted CD4 T cell proliferation as well as production of IL 2 IFN and IL 10 in the presence of suboptimal doses of anti CD3 mAb OKT3 . In addition the B7 H7CR mAb in immobilized form could mimic the role of B7 H7 to enhance T cell proliferation either alone or in synergy with CD28 mAb suggesting an agonistic feature of this B7 H7CR mAb. Furthermore inclusion of soluble B7 H7 mAb 2D3 or B7 H7CRIg abrogated the costimulatory effect of B7 H7 . Combined together these results support that B7 H7 and B7 H7CR interaction represents a novel T cell costimulatory pathway which promotes human T cell growth.

The mechanisms of these newly described costimulatory pairs in the regulation of immune responses is yet to be elucidated especially in the context of other costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways previously described. However this receptor ligand proteomic system represents a promising approach to discover new molecular interactions on cell surface. With the expansion of proteome to include all plasma membrane proteins this system could be utilized to identify any cell surface receptor ligand pair in question and there the significance should be well beyond mere understanding the immune system.

Protein interactions were measured and analyzed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument BIAcore AB Uppsala Sweden performed at 25 C. as described previously 20. 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl 0.005 surfactant P20 HBS was used as running buffer. Human B7 H2Ig CD28Ig and CTLA 4Ig were purchased from R D systems. All other reagents were purchased from BIAcore. The B7 H2Ig was covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip BIAcore AB by crosslinking primary amine groups to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix. A flow cell on the CM5 chip was activated with 1 1 N ethyl N dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS mixture followed by injection of 20 g ml B7 H2Ig diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 until desired response units RU were achieved. Another activated flow cell on the same chip which did not receive any fusion protein was used as a control sensor surface. The remaining activated carboxyl groups were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5 . Subsequently the flow cells were extensively washed with HBS to generate a stable baseline. ICOSIg CD28Ig and CTLA4Ig in serial dilutions were injected over the sensor surface in triplicates at a flow rate of 20 30 l min for 3 min and then the dissociation was allowed for 5 min. The flow cells were regenerated by two consecutive 10 second pulses with 10 mM NaOH. Data was analyzed by BIAevaluation software 4.1 BIAcore .

OKT3 mAb anti human CD3 was pre coated in 96 well plates at the indicated concentrations. B7 H2Ig or isotype matched control Ig at 5 g ml was also immobilized in the wells.

Purified human T cells were added into each well at 2.5 10 well and cultured for three days. In some experiments anti B7 H2 mAb MIH12 or 9F.8A4 was added at the beginning of culture and unbound mAbs were washed away by media before addition of T cells. 3HTdR was added during the final six hours of culture. 3H TdR incorporation was counted with a MicroBeta Trilux liquid scintillation counter PerkinElmer Waltham Mass. .

Human PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Fifty million PBMCs were adhered on a 100 mm tissue culture dish for 45 min in a 37 degree incubator. Adherent cells at 0.5 106 ml were cultured in 10 ml complete RPMI media containing 10 human AB serum. The media was supplemented with 500 U ml recombinant human interleukin 4 BD Biosciences and 1000 U ml recombinant human granulocyte monocyte growth factor for dendritic cell differentiation. On day 2 4 and 6 half of the media was replaced with fresh media and cytokines. On day 7 dendritic cells were harvested.

Using the receptor ligand proteome approach described in Example 6 we demonstrated that recombinant human CD28Ig fusion proteins bound to 293T cells expressing B7 1 B7 2 and B7 H2. A lower level of CD28Ig bound to cells expressing B7 H2 than cells expressing B7 1 and B7 2 . A binding activity to occuldin OCLN molecule was also found but later this interaction was demonstrated to be non specific data not shown . There was no additional binding activity by CD28Ig in our receptor ligand proteome . Therefore CD28 and ICOS may share a common ligand B7 H2.

This binding was first validated by staining of CD28Ig to B7 H2293T cells with optimized transient transfection protocol. High B7 H2 expression was verified by positive anti B7 H2 monoclonal antibody mAb staining and negative anti B7 1 and anti B7 2 staining by flow cytometry analysis . Under this condition a significant fraction of cells also stained positively with ICOSIg demonstrating the specific expression of B7 H2 on 293T cells. Importantly CD28Ig showed significant binding to B7 H2293T cells and this binding could be completely blocked by the inclusion of a mAb against CD28 clone CD28.6 . Interestingly CTLA4Ig could also bind B7 H2293T transfectant and the binding was largely blocked by a mAb against CTLA 4 clone 14D3 suggesting B7 H2 similar to B7 1 and B7 2 binds both CD28 and CTLA 4. To further validate these interactions 293T cells were transiently transfected to express high level CD28 or CTLA4 as shown by positive mAbs staining. Binding of these cells by B7 H2Ig demonstrated a significant staining. The binding could be completely abrogated by inclusion of a mAb against B7 H2 Clone MIH12 or by ICOSIg . These results support the specificity of interactions between B7 H2 and CD28 CTLA 4 and an overlapping binding site on B7 H2 for interacting with CD28 CTLA 4 and ICOS.

Next the binding affinity of B7 H2 to ICOS CD28 and CTLA 4 was compared by surface plasmon resonance SPR analysis . B7 H2 CD28 interaction had a significantly slower association constant K 1.2 10Ms and a faster dissociation constant K 0.017 s compared to B7 H2 ICOS K 2.4 10Ms K 0.004 s indicating that ICOS has a much higher affinity 100 folds than CD28 for binding B7 H2. Meanwhile B7 H2 CTLA 4 had slightly lower affinity 4 folds than B7 H2 CD28 interaction . When compared with the published affinity of B7 1 CD28 interaction KD 4 M 14 the affinity of B7 H2 CD28 KD 1.4 M and B7 H2 CTLA4 KD 5.5 M is in a similar range.

While these results reveal B7 H2 as a potential ligand for both CD28 and CTLA 4 there are several fundamental differences between these and previously identified interactions. CTLA 4 has at least a 10 fold higher affinity than CD28 to interact with B7s 14 whereas B7 H2 has similar affinity for these two receptors. CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells while ICOS and CTLA4 are inducible upon antigen stimulation 3 . Because B7 H2 is constitutively expressed by hematopoietic and non hematopoietic cells these findings implicate a role of B7 H2 in the costimulation of naive T cells through CD28. The role of B7 H2 in the inhibition of activated T cells via CTLA 4 may be minimal because B7 H2 has a much lower affinity for CTLA 4 than ICOS.

Next the B7 H2 CD28 interaction was examined to see if it could compete with other CD28 ligands B7 1 and B7 2. By flow cytometry analysis saturated doses of B7 1Ig and B7 2Ig had only minimal effect on the binding of CD28Ig to B7 H2293T cells supporting that CD28 interacts with B7 H2 through a different interface than B7 1 B7 2 . Interestingly B7 2Ig but not B7 1Ig appears to partially compete for the binding of CTLA 4Ig to B7 H2 indicating that the binding sites on CTLA 4 for B7 H2 and B7 2 may be partially overlapped . In contrast B7 1 and B7 2 are largely redundant in terms of their interaction with CD28 and CTLA 4 and could compete with each other for binding 1 . These findings implicate a new feature of CD28 costimulation more than one interface on a costimulatory receptor is available for different ligands to engage. These finding also suggest that B7 H2 could costimulate naive T cells through CD28 in synergy with B7 1 B7 2.

To understand the architecture of the interactions between B7 H2 and its three receptors site directed mutagenesis on B7 H2 was conducted to identify critical residues for these interactions. Selection of residues for mutation was based on their locations in the binding interfaces of B7 H2 and three receptors predicted from the crystal structure of B7 2 CTLA4 15 16 . These residues were all converted to alanine a small aromatic amino acid with neutral charge to avoid a large overall structure modulation 16 . Wild type wt and mutated B7 H2 full length genes were expressed on the surface of 293T cells and confirmed by anti B7 H2 mAb staining. The binding of these cells by CD28Ig CTLA 4Ig and ICOSIg were determined by flow cytometry analysis and relative binding capacity of these recombinant fusion proteins to B7 H2 mutants were compared to wt B7 H2 . All mutants which lost their binding to CD28 Y51A Y53A L116A and F122A also did not interact with CTLA 4 indicating that B7 H2 binding sites for CD28 and CTLA 4 are largely overlapped i.e. CD28 and CTLA 4 should compete for the binding to B7 H2. Two mutants Y51A Y53A that lost their binding to ICOS also show no binding to CD28 and CTLA 4. Interestingly two mutants L116A and F122A which largely retained the ability to bind ICOS have only minimal binding capacity to CD28 and CTLA 4. These results support the notion that B7 H2 uses non identical but overlapping binding sites for interacting with ICOS versus CD28 CTLA 4 whereas B7 H2 may use similar if not identical binding sites to interact with CD28 and CTLA 4.

The finding that B7 H2 might utilize differential binding sites to interact with ICOS versus CD28 CTLA 4 encouraged the seeking of mAbs that selectively block individual interactions to facilitate functional analysis. By screening available mAbs against B7 H2 the MIH12 was demonstrated to selectively blocked B7 H2 binding to CD28 CTLA 4 but not to ICOS whereas 9F.8A4 abrogated B7 H2Ig binding to all three receptors by flow cytometry analysis .

Consistent with previous reports 4 17 we demonstrated that mouse B7 H2 did not interact with mouse CD28 and CTLA 4 . Interestingly when mouse B7 H2 IgV region Met1 Val149 was replaced with its corresponding human counterpart Met1 Gln123 this chimeric gene product was capable of binding mouse CD28Ig and CTLA 4Ig indicating that mouse and human B7 H2 might have divergent evolutions from a common ancestor.

To demonstrate that the interaction of B7 H2 and CD28 is functional an in vitro costimulation assay was utilized in which suboptimal concentrations of human CD3 mAb were immobilized in the wells of a 96 well plate as a mimicry of T cell receptor TCR signaling. B7 H2Ig was co immobilized in the same well to provide a costimulatory signal for purified human T cells. While suboptimal concentrations of CD3 mAb up to 0.1 g ml did not stimulate significant proliferation of T cells inclusion of B7 H2Ig induced a high level proliferation of T cells as evidenced by increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine . The effect of B7 H2 was dependent on TCR signaling because B7 H2Ig itself in the absence of CD3 mAb did not stimulate any detectable proliferation data not shown . Inclusion of MIH12 mAb which specifically blocks B7 H2 binding to CD28 CTLA 4 suppressed about 50 of B7 H2Ig mediated costimulation. The 9F.8A4 mAb which blocks B7 H2 binding to all three receptors completely abolished the effect of B7 H2Ig . Using carboxyl fluorescent succinimidyl ester CFSE labeled human T cells to monitor cell division blockade of B7 H2 CD28 interaction with MIH12 had a partial inhibitory effect on the division of both CD4 and CD8 T cells whereas 9F.8A4 completely suppressed T cell division . Activated T cells in this setting expressed high level ICOS in addition to CD28 data not shown . These results suggest that both CD28 and ICOS on T cells independently contribute to the costimulatory effect of B7 H2. CTLA 4 was also upregulated on T cells with similar kinetics as ICOS in our experimental setting data not shown . However the predominant effect of B7 H2Ig in this system is enhancement of T cell growth. This is likely due to the low affinity of B7 H2 CTLA 4 interaction . All together these results support that B7 H2 is capable of costimulating T cell growth via engaging CD28.

One characteristic feature of CD4 T cell costimulation by CD28 and ICOS is that both of them induce high amounts of cytokines whereas TCR engagement alone produce minimal 3 . Cytokine production mediated by immobilized human B7 1Ig and B7 H2Ig in the same concentration was compared . Consistent with previous finding using CD28 and ICOS agonist mAbs 6 costimulation through B7 1 and B7 H2 induce a overlapping spectrum of T cell derived cytokines including TNF IFN IL 4 IL 5 IL 10 and IL 17 with one major difference that only B7 1Ig stimulated large amount of IL 2 3 . B7 1 also appears to elicit higher level of TNF and IFN while B7 H2 induces higher level IL 17A 18 . Both B7 1 and B7 H2 induced similar levels of other cytokines with small differences observed in different experiments data not shown . A major difference in comparison with previously published results using agonist mAb 3 it was found that B7 H2 did not preferentially stimulate IL 10 production .

In the context of this generally overlapping cytokine profiles induced by B7 1 and B7 H2 the relative contribution of B7 H2 CD28 vs. B7 H2 ICOS to the overall B7 H2 mediated cytokine production by antibody blockade was evaluated . As expected blockade by 9F.8A4 reduced all cytokine productions to background level indicating that cytokine production is dependent on all three receptors of B7 H2. However selective blockade of B7 H2 CD28 interaction by MIH12 partially decreased the production of the majority of cytokines with more profound effects on IL 4 IL 5 IL 10 and IL 17 but less effective on IL 2 TNF and IFN . These results indicate a significant portion of CD28 mediated Th2 and IL 17 cytokine production might be attributed to B7 H2 binding instead of exclusively to B7 1 B7 2 engagement.

The observation that B7 H2 CD28 interaction is not conserved in mouse prevents us to evaluate this pathway in vivo. Next the role of B7 H2 CD28 interaction in more physiologically relevant models in vitro including antigen specific memory T cell recall response and primary T cell responses to allogeneic antigens was evaluated. In the first model monocyte derived dendritic cells were incubated with tetanus toxoid TT to stimulate autologous peripheral T cells from an adult individual who was immunized previously with tetanus vaccine. The proliferation and IFN production of polyclonal long term memory T cells in response to TT antigen were examined in the presence of selected mAbs. MIH12 reduced TT antigen elicited proliferation by approximately 20 a small but significant inhibition P50 inhibition on proliferation and 90 on IFN production . These findings indicate that both CD28 and ICOS pathways are required for the proliferation and IFN production of memory T cells in this setting. B7 H2 CD28 interaction albeit plays a minor role in the growth of memory T cells is critical for TT induced IFN production from memory T cells.

In the second model monocyte derived dendritic cells were used for stimulation of allogeneic T cells from peripheral blood. In this culture system MIH12 also significantly suppressed IFN production from allogeneic T cells P

These findings demonstrate that B7 H2 is the third ligand for CD28 . B7 H2 is expressed constitutively by hematopoietic and non hematopoietic cells in peripheral organs whereas B7 1 and B7 2 are largely inducible molecules on selective antigen presenting cells. This distinct and non overlapping expression pattern of these three ligands may regulate T cell responses through CD28 CTLA 4 in spatially and temporally divergent settings. Constitutive B7 H2 expression may allow CD28 costimulation to be sustained in peripheral organs for effector or memory T cells. It is yet to be determined whether B7 H2 provides a completely overlapping signal as B7 1 and B7 2. The non competing nature of B7 H2 CD28 and B7s CD28 interactions also make it possible that B7 1 B7 2 and B7 H2 could bind CD28 simultaneously delivering synergistic costimulatory signals in lymphoid organs . These finding also warrant re evaluation of CD28 and ICOS pathways as targets for immunotherapeutic manipulation. For example the effect of CTLA 4Ig abatacept as an immunosuppressive drug could be interpreted at least partially as interference of B7 H2 CD28 interaction since CTLA 4 and CD28 share the same binding interface with B7 H2.
