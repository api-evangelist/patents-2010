The present invention relates to the field of x ray imaging. More particularly embodiments of the invention relate to methods systems and apparatus for imaging which can be used in a wide range of applications including medical imaging security screening and industrial non destructive testing to name a few.

Since its invention in 1973 X ray computed tomography CT has revolutionized medical imaging and become a cornerstone of modern radiology. Improving resolution and reducing dose are two critical factors in biomedical applications and remain the focuses of CT research. With the emergence of multislice spiral CT in 1998 cone beam scanning is recognized as a major mode for medical CT and widely used in numerous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Moreover the rapid development of small animal models especially those with genetically engineered mice has generated the need for preclinical imaging reaching image resolution in the micron range. These scanners while producing high spatial resolution images do not allow high contrast and low dose imaging in either patients or animal models. For example many normal and diseased tissues such as cancers display poor image contrast in current X ray images as they have very similar attenuation characteristics.

X ray mammography is currently the most prevalent imaging modality for screening and diagnosis of breast cancers. The use of mammography results in a 25 30 decreased mortality rate in screened women however a multi institutional trial funded by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network ACRIN suggested that approximately 30 of cancers were not detected by screening mammography and 70 90 of biopsies performed based on suspicious mammograms were negative. Some false negative and false positive diagnoses often led to missed cancers and inappropriate biopsies.

Conventional medical x ray imaging such as mammography relies on the attenuation contrast mechanism. Biological soft tissues encountered in clinical and pre clinical imaging such as breast tissue gray white brain matter liver mouse tissues etc. however consist mainly of light elements. As a result the elemental composition is nearly uniform without much density variation. Because of the insufficient contrast between the healthy and malignant tissues some early stage tumors cannot be identified using attenuation contrast imaging. In some cases the x ray attenuation contrast is relatively poor and cannot offer satisfactory sensitivity and specificity a key factor limiting the success rate in diagnosing diseased tissue.

Specifically for diagnosing breast cancer although X ray CT of the breast can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy over mammography the state of the art breast CT scanner is still based on the attenuation mechanism. As a result the use of breast CT requires an intravenous contrast medium and a high radiation dose since elemental composition is almost uniform with little density variation in breast tissues. Still it is rather difficult for breast CT to discern early stage breast cancers.

Absorption and scattering are two largely independent properties of an object. Generally speaking each is an important factor in characterizing an object optically. The literature already reported that scattering coefficients contain important physiological and pathological information for cancer screening and other purposes. The x ray scattering in the biological tissue provides an effective contrast mechanism for x ray imaging that may well outperform or effectively complement attenuation based imaging. Scattering based imaging can improve or enable diagnosis for early stage cancer and has widely applications to soft tissue imagings. By reconstructing both absorption and scattering properties x ray CT can be elevated to the next level with major healthcare benefits.

Driven by major practical needs for better X ray imaging exploration into contrast mechanisms other than attenuation has been active for decades especially in terms of small angle scattering essentially Rayleigh scattering and refraction of X rays which are also known as dark field and phase contrast imaging respectively.

Up to now X ray Rayleigh scattering based imaging has been limited to in vitro studies incapable of volumetric cone beam scanning lack of rigorous reconstruction theory and made little progress into clinical practice.

Since 2006 grating based X ray dark field and phase contrast tomography is being developed using a hospital grade X ray tube instead of a synchrotron facility or microfocus tube. More specifically for example Pfeiffer and coworkers proposed a grating interferometer technique to produce dark field images using a hospital grade x ray tube. F. Pfeiffer M. Bech O. Bunk P. Kraft E. F. Eikenberry Ch. Br nnimann C. Gr nzweig and C. David Hard X ray dark field imaging using a grating interferometer Nature Materials 7 134 137 2008 . This technology utilizes the optical interference principles to yield high quality dark field images. The boundaries and interfaces in the biological tissues produce strong signals in dark field images indicating detailed structural contours. Moreover dark field images have greater signal to noise ratios in soft tissues than bright field counterparts acquired with the same incident X ray dose. However the major problems with this grating based approach are small sample size long imaging time and high fabrication cost.

Such an imaging modality may greatly enhance sensitivity and specificity for soft tissue imaging revealing subtle structural variation of tissues. However the data acquisition procedure is quite time consuming. The gratings with large sizes and high slit aspects are difficult to fabricate and model especially since the analyzer absorption grating consists of Au pillars encased in epoxy and bounded using a frame.

In 2004 Harding proposed an x ray coherent scattering imaging method. It uses an x ray fan beam to illuminate an object slice for acquisition of coherent scattering data with multiple detector rows. G. Harding X ray scatter tomography for explosives detection Radiation Physics and Chemistry 71 869 881 2004 . The central detector row of this technology receives the transmitted radiation while the out of center rows record only scattered radiation. The technique is able to perform a rapid scan of the object and provides a significant increment in image contrast for quantitative analyses. However scattering cross talks cannot be avoided in this imaging modality and would significantly degrade image quality. Efficient and high quality acquisition of x ray small angle scattering signals is still a challenge.

Further for example to perform tomographic imaging from x ray small angle scattering signals Strobl et al. proposed a method to simulate the broadening of the angular distribution of small angle scattering for dark field tomographic imaging. This broadening is related to both microscopic structure and multiple scattering along the path length through a matter. Strobl M. W. Treimer and A. Hilger Applied Physics Letters 85 488 490 2004 and M. Strobl C. Gr nzweig A. Hilger I. Manke N. Kardjilov C. David and F. Pfeiffer Physical Review Letters 101 123902 2008 .

Harding and coworkers approximate the small angle scattering propagation as a linear model and directly used the filtered backprojection algorithm to reconstruction scattering contrast images from dark field data. See G. Harding 2004 . However the propagation of x ray photons through matter is a complex process which experiences both absorption and scattering simultaneously. A photon propagation model describes photon interaction with matter and is essential for tomographic imaging.

Thus what is needed is an imaging modality having sufficient sensitivity and specificity to provide high contrast high quality x ray based images. Provided by embodiments of the invention are several novel approaches and associated systems for x ray small angle scattering based imaging to produce high contrast images.

Provided in embodiments of the invention is a varying collimation methodology and other techniques for extraction of small angle scattering signals for dark field tomography while traditional attenuation based tomography can also be simultaneously performed in cone beam geometry. The projection data acquired with a collimator of a sufficiently high collimation aspect ratio contain mainly the primary beam with little scattering while the data acquired with an appropriately reduced collimation aspect ratio include both the primary beam and small angle scattering signals. Analysis of these corresponding datasets will produce desirable dark field signals which can be used to reconstruct x ray small angle scattering images based on the analytic model of the x ray dark field developed by the inventors. The data acquisition scheme can be implemented by modifying the collimation technology. Further it allows volumetric scanning such as with a circular and spiral trajectory.

Also provided by embodiments of the invention is the ability to achieve x ray dark field imaging with a multi pinhole collimator and an anti wide angle scattering collimator to acquire x ray small angle scattering signals. Source x ray beams transmit through the multi pinhole collimator to produce fan shaped multiple pencil beams well separated from each other. One to one correspondence between pencil beams and detector elements is established to ensure the small angle scattering photons generated from each pencil beam propagate toward its corresponding detector element center. The size of a detector element will be larger than that of a common CT detector for acquiring enough small angle scattering information. An anti scattering grid is placed in front of detectors to filter out wide angle scattering photons and allow for small angle scattering photons to reach its corresponding detector element from each pencil beam. The large size detector element helps fabricate a sufficiently high anti wide angle scattering grid to eliminate the cross talk among scattering signals. The low resolution induced from larger detectors can be compensated by continuously rotating the detector ring and the source collimator in the range of two neighboring pencil beams to increase the angular sampling rate and enhance the dark field image resolution. This scheme can acquire high quality x ray small angle scattering signals allowing a significant reduction of the x ray dose.

More specifically provided by embodiments of the invention is an x ray small angle scattering photon transport model for development of novel algorithms to reconstruct 3D scattering images. The reconstruction procedure can be effectively implemented with computational complexity comparable to that of conventional attenuation based CT algorithms.

Reference will now be made in detail to various exemplary embodiments of the invention. The following detailed description is presented for the purpose of describing certain embodiments in detail and is thus not to be considered as limiting the invention to the embodiments described.

Included in embodiments of the invention are methods for extracting x ray small angle scattering data and using this segregated data to produce a high quality high contrast x ray image. A technique for extracting the x ray small angle scattering data involves collecting the x ray projection data multiple times with varying collimation before an x ray detector array. In preferred embodiments each x ray sum is acquired at least twice using different collimation aspect ratios. The projection data acquired with a collimator of a sufficiently large aspect ratio otherwise referred to as a high collimation aspect ratio contain mainly the primary beam with little scattering. In contrast the corresponding data acquired with an appropriately reduced collimation aspect ratio otherwise referred to as a small or low collimation aspect ratio include both small angle scattering signals and the primary beam signals. Analysis of these paired or corresponding datasets e.g. by digital subtraction of one dataset from the other will produce or isolate the desired dark field signals in addition to traditional transmission measurement.

Conventionally an anti scattering grid is coupled with an area detector to eliminate x ray scattering photons. The intensity of scattered radiation into a detector cell is determined by the height of the anti scattering grid. The lower the height of the anti scattering grid is the more the scattered photons enter the detector cell. The height of the anti scattering grid is typically selected to reject scattered photos as much as feasible subject to the cost associated with the fabrication process.

In embodiments of the invention and depending on a specific imaging application the height of the anti scattering grid can be selected appropriately so that only the primary and small angle scattering signals are intercepted. The resultant projection is denoted as PS. Then the height of the anti scattering grid can be increased significantly so that small angle scattering signals are also rejected to acquire essentially only the transmission data. The corresponding projection is denoted as PT. Hence the difference between PS and PT is understood to be closely correlated to the desirable small angle scattering signals.

More specifically as shown in an imaging system according to embodiments of the invention comprises an x ray source for producing and directing an x ray beam through an object of interest and a collimator and detector assembly for receiving and detecting the x ray projection data. One embodiment can include use of a dual height collimator in combination with a 2D detector array . In such a configuration as shown a circular cone beam full scan can be performed in combination with a dual height collimator for example disposed in front of a 2D detector array.

In this setting on the mid plane each pixel on a given line is irradiated by two and only two x rays along that same line but with two different collimation heights in the opposite directions respectively sufficient for extraction of dark field signals. It is underlined that scatter intensities measured in opposite directions in one full scan are different from that measured in the same direction with two full scans since dark field integrals along the same line are generally asymmetric. Nevertheless this type of difference can be well modeled and calibrated by the governing equation modified Leakeas Larsen equation MLLE and then for example a generalized Feldkamp type dark field cone beam reconstruction can be performed from the resultant dataset. It is possible to apply this technology to other cone beam scanning trajectories which could lead to other useful cone beam algorithms. Actually varying collimation gives us a new dimension to analyze scattering signals. We may use two or more collimation aspect ratios depending on specific imaging requirements. It is also possible to have different varying collimation designs for example by changing the size of collimators for a fixed collimation height implementing various collimation aspect ratios. Also it is possible to vary the x ray tube voltage or imaging geometry for more information.

X ray single scattering model. While an x ray pencil beam propagates along a straight line this beam would become a source of photon scattering in an object being imaged. The number of scattered photons is directly related to density of matter which can be quantified by the scattering coefficient. The x ray scattering tomographic imaging is to reconstruct the scattering coefficient distribution in the object. The intensity distribution of photon scattering sources on this x ray beam line can be expressed as 

where is a projection angle and d is the distance from the origin to the pencil beam meeting r d and r s l .

Small angle and large angle x ray scattering signals come essentially from the coherent scattering Rayleigh scattering and incoherent scattering Compton scattering mechanisms respectively. Compton scattering describes the interaction of a photon with an electron in an outer shell of an atom. A fraction of the x ray energy is transferred to the electron. While the electron is ejected the x ray photon is deflected from its original path. The probability for an incoming photon with energy E being scattered in a direction can be described by the Klein Nishina formula 

where E mc mis the electron mass c the speed of light rthe classical radius of electron and n right arrow over r the free electron density.

Rayleigh scattering represents non ionizing interactions between x rays and matters. It is an elastic scattering process. The scattered photons have the same energy as the incident photons. The differential cross section of Rayleigh scattering or the probability of a photon scattering into a given angle is described by 

where F E Z is the atomic form factor. Since the form factor is highly complex most x ray Monte Carlo simulators use a database to store the form factor data. The form factor can be approximated with the simple function F E Z c e.

wherein and are the low and up bounds of scattering angles at position r which are a function of the size of the detector and the detector to object distance.

The attenuation coefficients in Eq. 5 can be obtained from attenuation based computed tomography CT . Hence Eq. 3 is a linear integral equation with respect to scattering coefficient which can be discretized as a system of linear equations 6 

where S is the discretized vector of scattering coefficient and b the measured number of scattering photons.

Compressive sensing CS theory asserts that one can reconstruct images with a sparse representation from far less samples or data than what the Nyquist sampling theorem demands. The success of CS relies on both the sparsity of an underlying image and the incoherence of the sensing matrix. Compressive sensing techniques can be used to perform the scattering image reconstruction based on Eq. 6 . The high order TV HOT approach was recently developed for interior tomography. See Yang J Yu H Jiang M Wang G 2010 High order total variation minimization for interior tomography. Inverse Probl 10.1088 0266 5611 26 3 035013 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This approach can be used as a criterion for dark field tomography. Statistical optimization methods can also be used for this purpose.

Single Scattering Method. A single scattering model in 3D can be used to demonstrate the varying height collimation technology. Although other models would be equally applicable the single scattering model represents the simplest x ray scattering scenario.

where H is the grid height D the aperture of the detector cell and R the distance from a scattering location to the detector cell. Note that the scattering behavior

X ray small angle scattering equation. In quantum mechanics light is considered with both wave and particle behaviors. Hence the x ray photon transmission can be treated as a beam of particles propagating through an object. As x ray photons interact with the object some photons would be deflected from the original direction due to a difference in the refractive index and generate a scattering signal. Thus x ray photons can be divided into transmitted photons traveling along a straight line in a direction and scattered photons deflected from the original direction. The propagation of transmitted photons along the direction can be well described by the Beer Lambert law 

where r t is the light intensity along the direction and the attenuation coefficient defined as a sum of absorption coefficient wide angle scattering coefficient and small angle scattering coefficient that is . Eq. 7 can be reduced to a Radon transform 

While an x ray beam propagates along a straight line some photons would experience a small angle forward scattering. The so called dark field image is formed through the small angle scattering of x rays. The small angle scattered photon intensity r depends on both absorption and scattering properties of an object. According to the energy conservation principle the difference d r of the small angle scattered photon intensity between the opposite sides of an elementary volume with a cross sectional area dA and length dh along the direction is equal to the difference between intensity of small angle scattered photons from the primary beam and the sum of the intensities of photons absorbed and wide angle scattered by the object which can be expressed as follows 9 

Since d r dA r dhdA a differential equation in terms of the small angle scattered photon intensity can be established from Eq. 9 10 

where r represents the loss of the small angle scattering intensity due to photoelectric absorption and wide angle scattering and r is the quantity of small angle scattered photons from the primary beam r . In other words Eq. 10 describes the balance of the photons between the input and output of an elementary volume at the given direction . Because Eq. 10 is a linear first order differential equation its solution can be obtained in the closed form 

Using a variable transformation Eq. 12 can be simplified to a Radon transform with respect to the small angle scattering coefficient distribution 

where r R and r R are the intensity of transmission photon and the intensity of small angle scattering photons on the detectors respectively. Eq. 13 can be normalized as

Monte Carlo Simulation Method. There exists a tetrahedron based inhomogeneous Monte Carlo optical simulator TIM OS for optical light propagation in complex biological tissue. The core of this simulator is a fast propagation algorithm which can move particles efficiently in complex geometry represented by tetrahedron finite element mesh. The TIM OS framework was migrated for x ray simulation to take advantage of the great speedup in optical simulation that can be achieved with this framework.

X ray and matter interaction is very complex in general. In this prototype MC x ray simulator a simplified x ray matter interaction model was considered to cover the three major components in dark field imaging Photoelectric effect absorption Rayleigh scattering and Compton scattering. Three parameters were used to describe the x ray matter interaction absorption coefficient scattering coefficient and Rayleigh percentage .

The definition of absorption coefficient is the probability of x ray absorption per unit path length. The scattering coefficient is the probability of an x ray photon involved in scattering Rayleigh or Compton scattering per unit path length. Rayleigh percentage determines the likelihood both Rayleigh and Compton scattering.

After an x ray photon is launched a routine will be followed to find out the entering point of the photon into the phantom. While the photon is in the phantom a step size will be generated based on the local absorption and scattering coefficients as s ln where is an uniform random number from region 0 1 . If this photon needs to go across several different regions the total step size s sis governing by the following equation s ln . After the photon moves the free fly step the photon will be absorbed or scattered based on the ratio of the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient. If the photon is absorbed the program will launch a new photon otherwise the photon is scattered.

According to the photon scattering will be governed by either the Rayleigh or Compton mechanism. Then the scattering angle will be found according to the corresponding form factor. Then the photon will be assigned another step size based on the current local x ray parameters. These steps will be repeated until the photon moves out of the phantom.

Voxel based and surface based schemes are two of the most popular techniques employed in x ray simulation to deal with a complex geometry. The surface based scheme uses a triangle mesh to represent the interface between two regions and the surface. In this case a simulation program needs to determine whether the involved photon moment will hit a triangle for each step. Given a complex geometry the photon triangle interaction could be very slow. The voxel based scheme directly uses a CT reconstruction volume to represent geometry. This may introduce a huge computational overhead when a high resolution volumetric image is used. The key idea underlying this tetrahedron based scheme is that by modeling an object as a tetrahedron based finite element mesh TIM OS can specify the photon triangle interaction rapidly and recursively. In other words since a photon starts its movement inside a tetrahedron the ray triangle interaction would only happen with one of the four triangles of the tetrahedron reducing the searching space significantly.

Simulation Result. Monte Carlo simulation was used to verify the varying collimation scheme and compare the single scatter method with Monte Carlo simulation result.

According to literature at 50 KeV water s total attenuation coefficient is 0.21 cm . In the attenuation coefficient the absorption is about 13.3 0.028 cm the Rayleigh scattering is 6.7 0.014 cm and Compton scattering is 80 0.168 cm . Two of the cubes had lower Rayleigh scattering coefficients and the other two had higher Rayleigh scattering coefficients.

Table III lists the x ray absorption and scattering coefficients at 50 KeV of the phantom components.

A parallel x ray source was used to provide x ray beams through the phantom subjected to imaging for detection by a collimator and detector assembly . The pixel size of the detector was set to 0.2 0.2 mmand there were a total of 600 600 pixels to cover the whole phantom area. The distance between the phantom and the detector plane was 2.5 cm. In system and method embodiments of the invention the distance between the object being imaged here the phantom can be varied to achieved different collimation heights. In this simulation a dual height collimator was used.

For example any distance between the object subjected to imaging and the detector sensor can be used depending on a particular application. Likewise varying collimation heights can also be achieved by varying distance between the x ray beam source and the detector regardless of where the object being imaged is disposed between the source and the detector. Providing exact distance dimensions would not be appropriate in this situation as depending on a particular application actual dimensions may or may not be relevant. What is important with respect to varying the distance between the source and the detector or varying the distance between the detector and the object being imaged is the change in distance from one imaging configuration to another.

Further for example to vary collimation height from one imaging scenario using a particular collimator and detector assembly configuration with a set collimator height that collimator and detector assembly can be adjusted and set to a different collimator height. Methods and systems of the invention can be adjusted accordingly for collecting data using collimator and detector assemblies that differ with respect to collimator height collimator aperture imaging geometry or distance between an object subjected to the imaging and the collimator and detector assembly or between an x ray source and the collimator and detector. Adjustments can be made to a single collimator and detector assembly or multiple collimator and detector assemblies can be used.

In this simulation the form factor e was adjusted for Rayleigh scattering such that the average Rayleigh scattering angle was 4.3 . In each run TIM OS traced a total of 2 10x ray photons.

By subtracting IH from IL the Rayleigh scattering image of . The varying collimation scheme correctly extracted the small angle scattering signals and the signal intensities reflected the relative Rayleigh scattering percentages. Hence Rayleigh scattering parameters based on the varying collimation scheme can be reconstructed similarly to reconstructing attenuation. Additionally the small angle scattering information e.g. data can be extracted by capturing two images at different object detector distances without changing the detector collimator physically. For example by subtracting the longer distance image from the shorter distance image we can digitally extract the small angle scattering information. is an image captured with a longer distance 17.5 cm than 2.5 cm given the same collimation ratio 10 . shows the difference between these two images.

While Monte Carlo simulation provides the golden standard for small scattering imaging simulation the single scattering method provides a faster way to estimate the small scattering signal. Thus we used Eq. 6a to predict the single scattering image for the phantom in assuming a low collimation ratio 10 and short detector object distance 2.5 cm. Here the computation of

As described embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems of a varying height collimation methodology for extraction of the dark field signal for dark field tomography. These methods and systems are advantageous in several aspects. Practically the technology can be implemented by modifying existing collimation technology slightly. Technically it allows volumetric scanning such as in circular and spiral cone beam geometries. Potentially it may be extended to probe other x ray interactions with materials. The described approach has potential for a wide range of applications including medical imaging security screening industrial non destructive testing and so on.
