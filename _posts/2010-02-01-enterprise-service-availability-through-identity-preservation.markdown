This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 500 805 filed Aug. 7 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 657 780 which is a continuation in part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 211 056 filed Aug. 23 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 778 976 which claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60 650 556 filed Feb. 7 2005.

The disclosed embodiments relate to data management and more particularly to providing enterprise service availability through identity preservation.

Servers like enterprise servers host critical production data in their storage systems and may require this data to be resilient to a variety of failures which could range from media to data center failures. In addition there may be a need for other enterprise servers to concurrently access this same critical data. These applications might include for example analysis monitoring and supervision of server functions to verify for example application or data compatibility. The former need may be addressed by a range of data protection schemes that may include tape based backup and the latter need may be addressed by a range of data management schemes that may include setting up a specialized analysis server with a replica of that critical production data and or software.

Typical data protection and management schemes may vary in their approach and are deficient in numerous areas. For example deficiencies in typical approaches can relate to a lack of application intelligence. Block and file based approaches are not application intelligent and do not preserve the integrity and consistency of server applications and or data. If data corruption strikes the primary server database the corruption is replicated to the typical disaster recovery copy of the data rendering it corrupt. Additionally traditional server disaster recovery solutions are file system based and require scripts and manual steps to re configure server services for failover. Manual steps are error prone and time consuming and scripts are customized per site and are expensive to maintain. Furthermore typical disaster recovery approaches force unsupported agents and filter system drivers and matching standby server names which can cause production system failures mis configuration and generally increase overall management complexity. Also direct access to the enterprise server by other servers can result in instability and performance load on the enterprise servers while other deficiencies may relate to the serial and offline nature of tape storage. Consequently there is a need for systems and methods that provide enterprise service availability while preserving server identities.

Each publication patent and or patent application mentioned in this specification is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety to the same extent as if each individual publication patent and or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

Systems and methods are described for service availability that provides automated recovery of server service in a timely and application intelligent manner maintaining application consistency and integrity while preserving server identity. The systems and methods collectively referred to herein as a Service Preservation System SPS manage complete recovery of server data and preserve continuity of server service reestablishing user access to server s after an event or disaster in which in which primary or other server s fail. The failures disasters and losses referred to herein can be at many levels and include but are not limited to accidental deletion of an item loss of an entire mailbox loss of an entire disk drive loss of an entire server and or loss of an entire server site.

As an example Microsoft Exchange Server alternatively referred to herein as an Exchange Server demands the highest levels of data protection and availability including off site data replication for protection of electronic mail archive data and electronic mail service continuity against site disasters or system outages. In this example the SPS of an embodiment provides automated disaster recovery of Exchange service in an application intelligent manner maintaining application consistency and integrity. Using the SPS administrators recover Exchange services to a local or remote standby Exchange Server with a one click operation. The SPS of an embodiment is available from Mimosa Systems Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. as the NearPoint for Microsoft Exchange Server Disaster Recovery Option.

The SPS of an embodiment is an add on module that integrates with a near line server also referred to herein as a near point server which can include the Mimosa NearPoint server and performs fully automated recovery of primary server services in the event of an event in which a server fails and or data is lost. The near line server s can be located locally with the enterprise servers or remotely depending on enterprise needs. For local server data protection the SPS protects the local server using application shadowing that does not rely on agent or filter system driver software. For replication of the near line server data to a remote site the SPS can integrate with third party replication software for example. With this combined approach the SPS addresses local server recovery using shadowing while catastrophic events are addressed by leveraging the combination of shadowing and service preservation as described in detail herein. The application intelligent recovery of the SPS described herein preserves consistency and integrity of server data and thus ensures a corruption free copy of server databases.

In addition to service preservation the SPS of an embodiment can be used to confirm configuration setup e.g. hardware software data etc. of server resources as well as to conduct pre tests or dress rehearsals of a service preservation system. Events for which the service confirmation might be used include migrating server data to new software versions and taking primary servers down for maintenance to name a few. Data migration refers to the transferring of data between computer systems storage types and or formats. Migrating servers or data in the SPS of an embodiment uses components of the SPS to perform data migration in a manner similar to that described herein for service preservation. The SPS of an embodiment includes an Administration Console that manages all disaster recovery configurations and policies with wizard driven menus that guide the administrator. Pre tests also referred to as dress rehearsals rehearsals or drills confirm configuration setup and disaster status reports continuously monitor the complete recovery configuration. In the event of a server or server site loss the SPS completely automates the recovery of server services to a standby server for example and preserves all archive data.

The SPS as described in detail herein provides full server service recovery including restoring server data rebinding mailboxes and re establishing server services ensuring fast reliable restoration of service to end users while eliminating any requirement that the enterprise server name match the primary enterprise server name. The SPS also provides automated disaster recovery of electronic mail services e.g. Exchange and near line server archive services in a single integrated solution with simplified configuration and management of disaster recovery. The SPS is a zero footprint recovery solution that operates without requiring agent or kernel driver software installed on the server thereby eliminating the typical causes of instability and eliminating the competition for processor memory and storage resources.

In the following description numerous specific details are introduced to provide a thorough understanding of and enabling description for embodiments of the SPS. One skilled in the relevant art however will recognize that the SPS can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other components systems etc. In other instances well known structures or operations are not shown or are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the SPS.

The near line server NL continuously shadows the primary server S during normal operations of the primary server S. Thus clients are directed to the primary server S during normal operations and the near line server NL generates and stores a replica or copy of all data of the primary server S. In response to a detected failure of the primary server S the near line server NL performs a redirected restore to the standby server S. The redirected restore includes operations during which the near line server NL propagates or copies the replica of the primary server data to the standby server S. The near line server NL also fails over or re homes all clients to the standby server S so that upon restart of the clients continuity of server services is preserved by automatically re establishing access to the services by the client devices via the standby server S.

Shadowing as used herein includes creating and maintaining a replica of enterprise application data in an application consistent manner. This is superior to and relatively more efficient than traditional replication or continuous data protection. Shadowing is also relatively more efficient than traditional capture using mechanisms such as Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP . Application data that is being shadowed is being stored on the near line server NL in the format of the original application and is available to the primary server S and or to a standby server S either immediately or in near real time when there are data corruptions or unrecoverable media failures.

The clients e.g. Enterprise Clients and servers e.g. Enterprise Servers and Alternate Servers can be any type and or combination of processor based devices. Reference to a system and or a server in the singular tense may include multiple instances of that system or server. Couplings between various components of the SPS embodiments described herein can include wireless couplings wired couplings hybrid wired wireless couplings and other network coupling types as appropriate to the host system configuration. The network components and or couplings between components of the SPS can include any of a type number and or combination of networks and the corresponding network components including but not limited to a wide area network WAN local area networks LAN metropolitan area network MANs proprietary network backend network and the Internet to name a few. Use herein of terms like transport interconnect or network is inclusive of a conventional Ethernet a Storage Area Network SAN and or other type of network. The protocols may be inclusive of Transmission Control Protocol TCP Internet Protocol IP TCP IP and layered protocols Internet Small Computer System Interface SCSI iSCSI Fibre Channel InfiniBand HyperTransport HT Virtual Interface VI Remote Direct Memory Access RDMA and a range of other protocols.

In addition to service preservation the SPS of an embodiment can be used to confirm configuration setup e.g. hardware software data etc. of server resources as well as to conduct pre tests or dress rehearsals of a service preservation system. Events for which the service confirmation might be used include migrating servers to new software versions and taking primary servers down for maintenance to name a few. Migrating servers to new software versions includes use of the SPS for data migration where data migration is the transferring of data between computer systems storage types and or formats. The service confirmation capability of the SPS functions the same as the service preservation described herein except that service confirmation does not require re homing of clients.

When the SPS determines that a pre test or dress rehearsal has been selected the primary server or server site continues to provide services to the clients. A redirected restore is performed during which the near line server copies the replica of the primary server data to the standby server. The standby server is activated so that operation of the standby server can be evaluated for detection of any component and or application of the standby server. Following verification of standby server operation the standby server is returned to a standby status . Operation returns to continue monitoring a status of the service.

In consideration of service preservation of a server in an enterprise setting or configuration the SPS of an embodiment provides total disaster protection for primary enterprise servers and automated recovery of enterprise services. The near line server NL protects the primary server in near real time using the continuous application shadowing described above. The near line server NL by itself is capable of restoring enterprise databases storage groups and or the entire enterprise server in the event of a hardware or software failure. The service preservation of an embodiment extends the capability of the near line server NL and enables automatic restoration of enterprise data to a local and or remote standby enterprise server including re starting of enterprise services and re mapping of mailboxes in service directories. The automated recovery process of the SPS restores all enterprise server data rebinds mailboxes in service directories cleans up system mailboxes rehomes all clients and restarts enterprise services. Upon completion users have access to the standby enterprise server with complete access to enterprise electronic mail and archive electronic mail to name a few. Thus automated recovery of enterprise servers performed by the near line server NL minimizes loss of service and provides business continuity of critical enterprise services.

One specific server configuration includes the SPS of an embodiment to provide total disaster protection for an Exchange Server and automated recovery of Exchange services. The near line server protects the Exchange Server in near real time using continuous application shadowing. As described above the near line server is capable of restoring Exchange databases Storage Groups or the entire Exchange Server in the event of a hardware or software failure. The near line server thus functions to provide restoration of Exchange data to a local or remote standby Exchange Server including restarting of Exchange services and re mapping of mailboxes in Active Directory Server. For Exchange service recovery therefore the SPS of an embodiment automatically rebinds mailboxes in Active Directory identifies Exchange Roles and Services re homes Exchange Roles and Services re homes Public Folder Store cleans up system mailboxes and remove duplicate items restarts Exchange Services and or restores Outlook and SSR service to end users.

Components of the SPS including the near line server can be physically located at any number of sites. For example the near line server can be physically located at the primary site along with the primary server S. is a block diagram of an SPS in which the near line server NL is located at the same site as the primary server S under an embodiment. As another example the near line server can be physically located at the standby site along with the standby server S. is a block diagram of an SPS in which the near line server NL is located at the same site as the standby server S under an embodiment.

Regardless of location of the near line server NL the SPS of an embodiment provides via the near line server NL a recent application consistent copy of data and is therefore able to restore service when there is a server or site failure. is a block diagram of an SPS showing numerous ways in which the near line server NL can provide an application consistent copy of data for service preservation under an embodiment. As described above if there is a server failure then the near line server NL can directly provide data access to a replacement or standby server S in a redirected restore operation S subsequent to or simultaneous with the redirected restore S the standby server S provides enterprise services to clients failed over A to the standby server S. Similarly the near line server NL can directly provide data access to the primary server S in a direct restore operation P subsequent to or simultaneous with the direct restore P the primary server S continues providing enterprise services to clients . Alternatively the near line server NL can impersonate a replacement server by using the replica of the enterprise data to directly provide enterprise services to clients failed over B to the near line server NL.

The SPS of alternative embodiments uses the shadowing redirected restore and fail over described above in restoring enterprise services in response to a catastrophic site failure. As described in further detail below the clients can be failed over A to a replacement standby server S or failed over B directly to the near line server NL that is located at a remote disaster recovery site e.g. recovery site of .

The client and other enterprise components not shown may be directly aware of the existence of the primary messaging server s and the near line server NL as distinct entities. Other variations are also possible which may include the interposing of a proxy entity between the clients and or one or more other relevant enterprise components so that the clients continue to get a single system view of the resource or service. This proxy aggregates one or more servers and one or more fail over entities e.g. servers . When there is a failure the proxy is able to fail over the requests from the client and or the enterprise to alternate resources. When the primary resources are restored then the proxy is able to fail the requests back fail back to the primary resources. The proxy and the enterprise servers and the near line server NL may be clustered replicated virtualized distributed and or components of a grid. It is possible for portions of the proxy to straddle the client the enterprise servers the data surrogate other enterprise components or some variation or combination.

During failures it is possible for the near line server NL to also materialize a historical snapshot of the data through an optional re hydrator module . This historical snapshot may be used in cases where the latest copy of the data may be infested by SPAM or viruses or if it is not trusted for some reason. For audit purposes it is possible for the near line server NL to simultaneously serve several snapshots in time to audit applications so that they can obtain a temporal or spatial view of the state of multiple production servers at multiple points in time. The snapshots in time can be served for any granularity of the data that matches specified pattern constituted with data and metadata. The SPS therefore can provide selective rollback and or roll forward using sophisticated criteria for different portions of the data.

As described above the SPS of an embodiment also supports continuous protection of replica data stored on the near line server. is a block diagram of an SPS in which the near line server NL is replicated on a standby near line server NL under an embodiment. The SPS includes a first near line server NL coupled to a first server S. The first server S which can be referred to as a primary server and which can include multiple servers functions as a primary server S of an enterprise and in so doing couples or connects to provide server services to numerous clients . A second near line server NL is coupled to the first near line server NL. The second near line server NL is coupled to provide replica data to the first server S and or to a second server S via a redirected restore as described herein. The second server S which can also include multiple servers is coupled functions as a backup or standby server S of an enterprise and in so doing is capable of coupling or connecting to provide server services to numerous clients .

The first near line server NL can be located at the data center site of the primary server S at the recovery site of the standby server S or at another remote site. Likewise the second near line server NL can be located at the data center site of the primary server S at the recovery site of the standby server S or at another remote site.

The first near line server NL continuously shadows the primary server S during normal operations of the primary server S. Thus clients are directed to the primary server S during normal operations and the first near line server NL generates and stores a replica or copy of all data of the primary server S. Furthermore components of the SPS replicate the data of the first near line server NL on the second near line server NL. The replication can be asynchronous byte level replication but is not so limited.

The SPS uses the second or standby near line server NL to protect all data residing on the first near line server NL data that includes the shadow volumes the SQL database and the message items to name a few. In the event of a single volume failure or a complete system failure on the first near line server NL data can be restored quickly using the second near line server NL. When the data restoration is complete the replication software automatically re synchronizes the data volumes and replication begins again. In this manner the critical enterprise data and archive data on the near line server are always protected.

More specifically in response to a detected failure e.g. hardware and or software failure of the first near line server NL the second near line server NL is promoted to become active. Once active the second near line server NL performs a redirected restore to the standby server S in response to a detected failure e.g. hardware and or software failure of the primary server S. The redirected restore includes operations during which the second near line server NL copies the replica of the primary server data to the standby server S. The second near line server NL also re homes all clients to the standby server S so that upon restart of the clients continuity of server services is preserved by automatically re establishing access to the services by the client devices via the standby server S.

The roles of components of the SPS change in operations during which enterprise services are provided by the standby server S. is a block diagram of the SPS when the standby server S is serving as the primary service provider following failure of the primary server S under an embodiment. The second near line server NL continuously shadows B the standby server S during normal operations of the standby server S. Thus clients are directed B to the standby server S during normal operations and the second near line server NL generates and stores a replica or copy of all data of the standby server S. Furthermore components of the SPS replicate B the data of the second near line server NL on the first near line server NL.

The SPS now uses the first near line server NL to protect all data residing on the second near line server NL. In the event of a single volume failure or a complete system failure on the second near line server NL data can be restored quickly using the first near line server NL. When the data restoration is complete the replication software automatically re synchronizes the data volumes and replication begins again. In this manner the critical enterprise data and archive data on the active near line server are always protected.

When the primary server S is returned to service the second near line server NL can perform a fast fail back X during which the replica data of the second near line server NL is propagated or copied to the primary server S. The first near line server NL is promoted to become active and upon becoming active re homes all clients to the primary server S so that upon restart of the clients continuity of server services is preserved by automatically re establishing access to the services by the client devices via the primary server S as described above with reference to . Alternatively upon return of the primary server S to service the first near line server NL can perform a redirected restore B of replica data to the primary server S. The automatic service preservation can straddle multiple geographically disparate sites. This may incorporate multiple mechanisms such as near line servers and incorporate and extend mechanisms that are used for transporting storing and post processing data in the data protection application as described above. As a consequence of the distribution of the automatic service preservation the enterprise data is resilient to catastrophic failures that might include server data center and site failures. In the presence of such failures it may be possible for the SPS to facilitate service preservation directly to clients and applications by returning recent copies of data and or facilitating the deployment of replacement servers. This service preservation may involve the cooperation of other enterprise components or it may involve the introduction of proxies that render these fail over and fail back operations transparent or some variation or combination.

Service preservation of server sites provided by the SPS therefore includes protection of all server resources including enterprise servers and near line servers. is a block diagram of an SPS configured to provide server site service preservation under an embodiment. The SPS configuration is flexible in that it can be configured to match the particular requirements of each site. The SPS includes a first near line server NL coupled to a first server S and a second near line server NL coupled to a second server S. The first near line server NL is coupled to the second near line server NL via one or more network couplings or connections.

The first server S and first near line server NL are components of a first server site SITE of the enterprise also referred to as a primary data center SITE. The first server S which can be referred to as a primary server and which can include multiple servers functions as a primary server S of an enterprise and in so doing couples to provide enterprise services to numerous clients . The second server S and second near line server NL are components of a second server site SITE of the enterprise also referred to as a recovery data center SITE. The second server S which can also include multiple servers functions as a backup or standby server S of an enterprise and in so doing is capable of coupling or connecting to provide server services to numerous clients .

The first near line server NL continuously shadows the primary server S during normal operations of the primary server S. Thus clients are directed to the primary server S during normal operations and the first near line server NL generates and stores a replica or copy of all data of the primary server S. Furthermore components of the SPS replicate data of the first near line server NL on the second near line server NL. The replication can be asynchronous byte level replication but is not so limited.

The SPS uses the second or standby near line server NL to protect all data residing on the first near line server NL. In the event of a single volume failure or a complete system failure on the first near line server NL data can be restored quickly using the second near line server NL and the second server S. More specifically in response to a detected failure e.g. hardware and or software failure of the first server site SITE the second near line server NL is promoted to become active and manages failover of enterprise server services. Once active the second near line server NL performs a redirected restore to the second server S of the second site SITE in response to a detected failure e.g. hardware and or software failure of the primary server S. The redirected restore includes operations during which the second near line server NL copies the replica of the primary server data to the second server S. The second near line server NL also re homes the clients to the standby server S so that upon restart of the clients continuity of server services is preserved by automatically re establishing access to the services by the clients via the standby server S. As described above when the primary server S is returned to service the second near line server NL can perform a fast fail back X during which the replica data of the second near line server NL is propagated or copied to the primary server S alternatively the second near line server NL can also perform a redirected restore of the replica data to the primary server S.

Service preservation is provided using a recovery site RS coupled to each of the production sites SITEX. The recovery site RS includes a recovery server SS coupled to a recovery near line server RNL. Components of the SPS B replicate X data of the near line server NLX of each site on the recovery near line server RNL e.g. data of near line server NL of SITE is replicated on the recovery near line server RNL at the recovery site RS etc. . The recovery server RS which can also include multiple servers functions as a backup or standby server of the enterprise and in so doing is capable of coupling or connecting to provide server services to numerous clients not shown served by any one or all of the production sites in response to a failure of one or more of the production server sites as described above.

The enterprise servers comprise numerous types and or combinations of servers that include messaging collaboration portals and or database servers. The enterprise servers host a variety of structured semi structured and unstructured data. These servers may include individual clustered replicated constituents of a grid virtualized and or any combination or variation. An example enterprise server includes a Microsoft Exchange Server but the embodiments described herein are not so limited.

Enterprise clients include numerous types and or combinations of clients that provide end user access to servers. An example client is Microsoft Outlook but the embodiments described herein are not so limited.

The interaction between the enterprise clients and servers is referred to herein as server access or normal access. In the example SPS that includes Microsoft Exchange and Outlook the protocols for server access may be MAPI but the embodiments described herein are not so limited. Other possible protocols include IMAP4 and POP3.

The data replicas or surrogates enable the various data management solutions for servers and enhanced capabilities for clients as described herein. The SPS of an embodiment can include one or more alternate surrogates which include a remote copy of any data surrogate that is isolated from the source in order to protect production data from catastrophic site disasters. Shadowing as described above maintains a current copy or replica of production enterprise data in a data surrogate. The replica data may be optionally translated into multiple alternate formats and augmented with metadata.

The SPS uses redirection to revive servers and or alternate servers after the servers and or alternate servers have incurred any data related corruptions or loss. The data used in the redirections includes data hosted in the shadow within the data surrogate . The term redirect is more specifically used when the target server is different from the original server the term used when the target and original are same is restore .

Disaster protection refers to the ability of the SPS to restore data and or service in order to support business operation if there is a catastrophic site disaster. Self service and auditor access includes the capability for the clients to have direct but secured access to the data surrogate for example this access includes end user access to their historical archives and auditors needing to process historical messaging information to name a few. Regarding service proxies and preservation this refers to the existence of an application consistent copy of production data at the data surrogate or one of the alternate surrogates facilitates delivery of the original service or operation of a shadow proxy or replacement server by the SPS in order to enhance reliability scale or efficiency.

The combination of near line servers to log shipping generates a data surrogate. Generally in an embodiment the primary server is coupled to the near line server as described above and is generating write ahead logs. The near line server receives the logs and applies them to a baseline copy of the primary server database received previously. The result of application of the logs to the data by the near line server is an application consistent data surrogate. Log shipping is thus used to generate or create and maintain a shadow copy of data that is updated periodically based on some event or predefined schedule. Unlike some forms of traditional log shipping the data management applications of an embodiment can operate concurrently on the shadow copy while it is being updated. The description of data surrogation provided herein using near line servers or log shipping is just an example since data surrogation may be implemented using a variety of other techniques.

When data surrogation is implemented using a near line server the near line server is not limited to a single machine but can include a distributed system involving multiple machines offering various combinations of specialization of function and load balancing for scalability and fault tolerance. Furthermore the storage for a near line system may not necessarily be a single storage system but can include a collection of storage devices perhaps using a storage area network SAN for homogeneous and heterogeneous functions such as data management data analysis brick extraction indexed object repository full text indexing data mining etc. . Furthermore the near line server can be locally replicated in order to facilitate the resiliency of the near line server and the availability of the data that it is hosting.

An example of operations of the SPS of an embodiment is described below. The SPS of this example is an embodiment that includes the Mimosa NearPoint solution integrated with Microsoft Exchange Server and Active Directory Server. In operation network or system administrators initiate with a single click complete recovery of Exchange services using recovery policies that are pre configured and tested to be correct. The following describes policy configuration and recovery operation using the SPS.

The SPS includes many automated features wizard driven menus and pre tests to ensure reliable Exchange recovery. In the event of a server site or data loss event at a primary data center an administrator can initiate complete recover of Exchange services via one click at the NearPoint Administrator Console. Following is a description of total Exchange recovery using the SPS.

This example assumes Exchange messaging services and NearPoint services SPS are in full operation and that the Exchange Server and the NearPoint server are co located in the primary data center. NearPoint is managing the Exchange Server and has completed a full shadow copy and the continuous protection process is running with the NearPoint Log Shipping. Additionally NearPoint is managing the archive with administrator defined policies for self service access retention and disposition Mailbox Extension and data exclusion.

Disaster recovery setup begins using the NearPoint Administrator Console to establish the NearPoint server pair and begin replication. The administrator can right click the NearPoint server and select NearPoint Server Disaster Recovery Setup . is an example screenshot of selection of NearPoint Server Disaster Recovery DR setup under an embodiment.

The administrator then enters the name of the NearPoint server at the recovery site. is an example screenshot of NearPoint server name entry under an embodiment. The NearPoint server name is generally the name of the second NearPoint server located at the recovery site. If only one NearPoint Server is deployed then its name is input. In this example no replication services are deployed.

NearPoint performs a comparison of the two NearPoint servers to make sure their configurations match. A Check Report is issued confirming the test passed. is an example NearPoint Check Report under an embodiment. When the administrator selects finish the replication software begins its continuous protection of the NearPoint server. All the replication software settings are transparently managed by NearPoint .

The administrator continues setting up Exchange DR by configuring the Exchange Server recovery pair is configured. is an example screenshot of Exchange Server recovery pair configuration under an embodiment. In this screen the name of the primary Exchange Server is input and the name of the standby Exchange Server is input. NearPoint automatically verifies that the standby server is configured correctly checks for matching Storage Group and Mailbox Store names and confirms that the Mailbox Stores are empty except for the default system mailboxes. The name of the standby server is not required to match the primary Exchange Server this makes it possible to setup the standby server quickly without the requirement of managing two servers with the identical names in the same Domain.

When setup is complete administrators monitor the replication services if deployed and the Exchange recovery pair using a status page on the NearPoint Administrator Console. In the event of a disaster working on the NearPoint console Administrators initiate full Exchange recovery as described below.

The administrator uses the DR Status page to monitor the status of the DR configuration including the NearPoint replication services and the Exchange recovery pair. is an example of a NearPoint DR Status page under an embodiment. The top portion of the page includes or lists the Exchange recovery pair and corresponding configuration status. Green lights indicate that the configuration is correct and ready for recovery. The middle or center portion of the page lists the replication operations and their status. The bottom portion of the page lists the DR NearPoint status.

If disaster strikes the primary Exchange Server the administrator initiates Exchange recovery using the NearPoint Administrator Console. In the configuration with a replicated NearPoint server the recovery includes use of the NearPoint server at the recovery site otherwise the recovery includes use of the single NearPoint server. The administrator after logging on to the NearPoint Administrator Console initiates recovery of Exchange with a right click of the Exchange Server and selects Disaster Recovery Failover . is an example screenshot of selection of Disaster Recovery Failover under an embodiment.

Upon initiation of recovery by the administrator NearPoint performs automatic recovery of all Exchange servers. The automatic recovery of an embodiment includes one or more of restoring Exchange databases rebinding mailboxes in Active Directory reconfiguring Exchange Server re homing Public Folder Store identifying Exchange Roles and Services cleaning up system mailboxes and removing duplicate items and restarting Exchange Services. The recovery operations restore electronic mail service to end users.

Any Exchange services that need to be cleaned up using Exchange Storage Manager are listed by NearPoint when recovery completes. is an example screenshot showing the list of Exchange services that require cleaning under an embodiment. Examples of Exchange services that require cleaning are Recipient Update Services and Offline Address Lists Global Address setup both of which are site specific. Using the NearPoint Administrator Console the administrator manages the new Exchange Server and begins data protection with a full shadow copy and log shipping. Exchange recovery is now complete and users have access to their mailboxes containing all their electronic mail running on the standby Exchange Server. They also continue to have access to all their archive electronic mail via Outlook and Outlook Web Access OWA .

The SPS as described above provides a higher level of disaster recovery protection for enterprise services without the necessity of agent software installed on the enterprise servers. The SPS provides an automated disaster recovery solution that protects both data on the enterprise server as well as the archived data. The SPS continuously protects enterprise data locally while replicating the near line server data continuously to a remote site. The recovery process of the SPS is automated and pre configured to deliver fast reliable results so that enterprise services are restored quickly and with minimal loss of data and minimal service disruption.

Traditional enterprise recovery solutions take a file or block based approach to replicating enterprise data based on their heredity as file system replication solutions. If corruption strikes an enterprise database these solutions instantly replicate the corruption to the standby server rendering it corrupt. In contrast the SPS is application intelligent in that it uses shadowing to always have a consistent copy of enterprise data ready for recovery thereby preventing corrupted data from reaching the standby server.

Additionally conventional enterprise recovery solutions are highly invasive to existing enterprise environments and require that kernel level agents be installed to intercept byte level changes. Kernel level agents are typically not supported by enterprise servers and increase the risk of service interruption. In contrast to these conventional systems the SPS performs on the near line server and does not disrupt the enterprise environment with any agent software. Thus existing enterprise environments remain unchanged and all disaster protection is managed off host on the near line server.

Moreover server recovery solutions have typically relied on manual steps and scripts which are time consuming error prone and expensive to maintain. In contrast the SPS offers a fully automated recovery solution for servers and sites. Using fully programmatic methods system administrators can perform complete server and or site recovery with one click with the SPS of an embodiment. Therefore system administrators can perform recovery more quickly and with more confidence knowing that the disaster recovery policies previously setup are pre tested and ready to perform at a moments notice. The SPS can therefore substantially avoid the use of potentially very expensive array based and unreliable host based disaster recovery solutions that are very complex and costly to manage.
