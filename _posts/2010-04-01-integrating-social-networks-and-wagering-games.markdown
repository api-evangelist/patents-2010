Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings like casinos e.g. resort casinos roadside casinos etc. . The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network such as the Internet can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device e.g. a personal computer a laptop a personal digital assistant a cell phone etc. can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites online casinos . However online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non wagering game business environment. As a result wagering game manufacturers casino operators and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.

Social network applications are appearing online in vast quantities. Internet users are enjoying a proliferation of blogs microblogs aggregators etc. Messaging mediums are exploding in use e.g. e mail instant messenger SMS text messages MMS multimedia message chat messages etc. . In short social networking and other forms of electronic social communication mechanisms and devices are popular for many online users. Many of those online users are also wagering game enthusiasts. Wagering games are also expanding in popularity. Many wagering game enthusiasts are demanding greater access to wagering games and content related to wagering games especially content that includes social networking As stated previously some wagering game companies have created online wagering game websites that provide a way for wagering game enthusiasts to play wagering games while connected to the Internet e.g. via a web browser . Some online wagering game websites provide various features such as social network functionality. Social networks allow wagering game players players to create user accounts with one or more unique identifiers that represent an online persona. One example of a unique identifier is an avatar . Avatars are graphical cartoon like depictions of a social network persona. These online personas and associated avatars add to the fun of belonging to a social network. Many online casinos however present an unsatisfactory wagering game experience to players who enjoy a more integrated gaming experience. Embodiments however present examples of integrating social networks social community website applications messaging mediums blogs other social communication mechanisms with wagering games and network gaming venues e.g. online casinos a wagering game websites wagering networks etc. . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network e.g. public or private that provides access to wagering games such as a website e.g. via wide area networks or WANs a private gaming network e.g. local area networks or LANs a file sharing networks a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. . In some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling .

In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a social network account associated with the wagering game player account. The system can in some embodiments determine a request from a player account logged in to a wagering game website to connect to a social network account associated with the player account. The social network account can be associated with a social network website. The player account use stored social network account information e.g. login information for the social network account to connect to the social network account. In some embodiments the system can determine a request from the social network account logged in to the social networking website to connect to the player account associated with the social network account. The social network account can use player account information e.g. login information for the player account to connect to the player account.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines one or more applications from the social network that are associated with the social network account. The applications can be game applications or non game applications. For example in the system determines from the applications console the game related applications e.g. Poker Blackjack Pac Man and Breakout and the non game applications e.g. Photo Album Videos Related Friends etc. . The system can read settings for the social network user account in the social network server and access application content stored on the social network server .

The flow continues at processing block where the system integrates the one or more applications with a wagering game session for the wagering game player account. For instance the system can install a web widget in association with the social network account for the social network website. The web widget can integrate with the applications provided by the social network website. The system can activate the web widget when the social network player account connects to a social network website and engages in a social network session. The web widget can also have a login feature for the player account. The player account can login to the wagering game website online casino wagering game network or other wagering game venue using the login feature. The web widget thus connects the player account to the social network account. In some embodiments the system can activate the web widget when the player logs in to the wagering game website and automatically connects to the social network website via stored social network connection information. The web widget can track activity performed by the social network account or the player account and report activity back and forth between the social network website and the wagering game website. In some embodiments the system integrates the one or more applications with the wagering game session by integrating one or more of features and activity of a social network website application into a wagering game website session for the wagering game player account e.g. the system incorporates a photos comments updates etc. from a social network photo album application into a wagering game website . In some embodiments the system can share events that occur on the wagering game website with multiple associated social network websites e.g. multiple social network websites that the player account has registered to share information with . In some embodiments the system can integrate activity from a social network game application into the wagering game session. For example as described in the system integrates the game related applications with the online casino website . The player account can play a selected game related application from the social network website via the online casino website . For instance the system can present the selected game related application through a game interface e.g. port the selected game related application from the social network server and embed it in a wagering framing or gambling user interface within the second browser on the online casino website . The selected game related application could still be provided by run by processed by etc. the social network server . The game interface can integrate with the online gaming server and present gambling features e.g. betting controls wagering game account features etc. of the online casino website . In some embodiments the system can determine a game play outcome from the selected game related application and determine a bet on the game play outcome associated with the wagering game player account. For example the system can read a default bet stored for the player account . The system can also prompt the player e.g. via the game interface to enter a bet. The system can use funds from the player account to transact the bet. The system can then transact the bet using the game play outcome of the selected game related application. In some embodiments the selected game related application is a wagering game type game e.g. a Poker game but is not an actual wagering game application. In other words the selected game related application can produce a casual play game outcome or a non monetary outcome that is not derived from cash or other monetary wagers and that provides non monetary scores or rewards e.g. points a score etc. . The system however can convert the casual play game outcome to a wagering game outcome and use the wagering game outcome to transact the bet. In some embodiments the system can present the selected game related application from the social network website within the first browser and the system can convey activity performed within the application to the online gaming server . The selected game related application may normally be played casually e.g. not for cash wagers when not integrated with the online gaming server . However when integrated the system can convey the game activity e.g. game moves game results etc. from the selected game related application to the online gaming server and the player account can play the selected game related application for money e.g. can place cash wagers . In some embodiments the system can determine a competitive group outcome and use the competitive group outcome to transact the bet. For example as described previously the player account or associated social network user account can challenge friends to competitive games and make monetary wagers on the game outcomes. Returning to in some embodiments the system can present a group game to one or more social network accounts and can present the same instance of the game to one or more wagering game players accounts. The system can accept wagers from the one or more wagering game player accounts and award those player accounts with monetary compensation for winning bets. At the same time the system can present the same game to the one or more social network accounts for causal play and can provide non monetary prizes. In some embodiments the system can provide non monetary awards to player accounts and social network accounts that perform social network activity e.g. chats inviting friends etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a wagering game activity and generates a wagering game representation of the wagering game activity. The player account can play the wagering game. The wagering game can produce an interesting activity or result such as a win or a near win that the player account wants to share with others accounts e.g. one or more social contact accounts associated with the player account e.g. friends family etc. and or with the one or more social network accounts associated with the player account. The system can record and store the wagering game activity in a wagering game representation e.g. a video an animation a textual description a still image a game element a link to game information etc.etc. . The wagering game representation can include a graphical presentation of a portion of a wagering game outcome any portion of a wagering game session leading up to the outcome congratulatory displays textual descriptions of events within the wagering game a follow up presentation of an award a depiction of an award redemption interviews of a player and any other information associated with the wagering game.

The flow continues at processing block where the system generates messaging medium content that includes the wagering game representation. For example the system can embed a link of a wagering game win into a text message. illustrates an example. In a wagering game system system includes a mobile telephonic client mobile client connected to an account server via a communications network . The mobile client can include a display . The display presents a text message generated by the system . In one embodiment the text message e.g. an SMS message includes a textual statement along with a replay link . In some embodiments the replay link is a written link to a website an active link to a website and an active link to a file included with the text message. When activated the replay link can present a replay presentation of the interesting gaming event e.g. the win . In some embodiments the replay link can include a graphical control a button an animation sounds or other objects and multimedia embedded into the text message e.g. an MMS message . In other embodiments however the replay link can be text without graphics or sounds. In some embodiments the system can integrate an embeddable form of content via a URL embed instruction e.g. a YouTube video into the replay link .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines one or more social contact accounts associated with the social network account and sends the messaging medium content to one or more designated social contact accounts. For instance in the account server can be associated with a publish setting associated with a player account. The publish setting can include names of social contacts that will receive the text message produced by the mobile client . Returning to in some embodiments the system may include a manual publication button that a player account can use to initiate the creation and sending of the messaging medium content. For instance in the online casino includes the publishing control that the player account can use to publish wagering game representations to friends e.g. social contact accounts cell phone numbers email addresses etc. associated with the player account . Returning to some social contacts can be subscribed to the player s messaging medium content via a social network application that the social contacts use in conjunction with their own social network accounts. In some embodiments the system can determine settings that indicate the designated social contact accounts. The designated social contact accounts can be a subset of a social contact group stored on the social network account. In some embodiments the system can automatically post interesting events to sites groups of friends etc. via text message instant message chat email or other forms of electronic social communication and messaging media.

The flow continues at processing block where the system presents the wagering game representation when activated. For example a social contact can receive the messaging medium content e.g. receive a text message via a mobile client receive an instant message via an instant message application receive a chat message via a social network chat application etc. . The social contact can activate control information included in the messaging medium content e.g. click on the embedded link within a text message click on a screen shot in an email etc. . The control information can include meta data that stores a location of stored content such as location of a video of the wagering game representation. The system can then present the activated content e.g. play a video of a wagering game representation . In some embodiments the system can reveal a wagering game representation slowly e.g. the system can first show a screen shot of the event associated with wagering game activity and require the recipient to log on to a website or download software before the recipient can view a video of the event . In other embodiments the system can present the wagering game representation immediately e.g. within the messaging medium content on a player application associated with a mobile device etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system tracks activity of recipients of the messaging medium content. For example the system can track activity of the one or more social contact accounts that receive and view a messaging medium content e.g. track activity of friends who click on a video of a wagering game replay . The system can reward the recipient s activity and or the sender s activity. For example the system can provide guaranteed prize e.g. a win a game enhancement a promotion points fun dollars etc. to friends who activates the messaging medium content or reward the sender e.g. multi level type marketing points loyalty points etc. . In some embodiments the system can send an email to a recipient with a code included in the text message and or on the replay presentation. The code can be used to redeem a prize on a wagering game website a social network website a third party affiliate s website etc. In some embodiments the system can integrate with an instant buddy list and can set up the buddy list to shows items associated with buddies such as message rewards for activity prizes replay presentations etc.

In some embodiments a wagering game system can integrate with mobile clients in various ways to use messaging medium content and or integrate wagering game activities in social communications. Below is a list of some possible embodiments 

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines an event indicated by the wagering game player account with an ascertainable but undetermined outcome. The event can be any event e.g. activity revealing of an unknown fact etc. that has an outcome that is unknown and or undetermined i.e. yet to be determined or revealed to the player account or any other player account betting on the same event. For example for an event that is an activity the event is the performance of the activity and the result of the activity is the event s outcome. In another example for an event that is not an activity such as revealing an unknown fact the event is the revealing of the fact and the fact is the event s outcome. The system will reveal the outcome of the event at a future time to the players. In some embodiments the event can be any occurrence e.g. real world event game related event random event etc. whose outcome is outside of the control of the player associated with the player account or any other player involved in betting against the player account. For example the event can include activities such as a wagering game play performed by a third party weather occurrences stock values surveys about something that might happen sports events elections etc. In other embodiments however the event can be controlled at least partially by the player account or any other player account betting against the player account e.g. betting on a competition between the player account and other player accounts betting on who can make the most sales in a month etc. . The system can provide controls for players to create their own peer to peer bets such as on events that are known and or of interest only to the peers involved e.g. will a friend s marriage last can a friend eat a 50 ounce steak in 10 minutes etc. . The event can have multiple possible outcomes i.e. two or more which the player account and other player accounts can bet on. In some embodiments the betting performed by the player account on any event may be referred to herein as anytime betting as the player is allowed to indicate any event with an undetermined outcome at any time that another player is willing to bet against. The system can include a gambling mechanism that the player account uses to indicate the event and also to place bets and receive outcomes. The gambling mechanism can be any combination of hardware software etc. such as an electronic device a wagering game machine a computer a cell phone a web application a plug in a website user interface a toolbar an add on on a toolbar a widget e.g. on a website on a blog on a device a messaging application or any other mechanism that can facilitate betting between individuals on event outcomes. In some embodiments the gambling mechanism is a widget on a social network website. For example in the web widget can include an anytime betting button . A player can activate the anytime betting button on the web widget . The system can cause a betting interface or betting console to appear. The betting console can have an event control that indicates possible events for the player account to bet on or in which the player can specify an event with an ascertainable but undetermined outcome. Returning now to in some embodiments the widget can be on a mobile device such as a cell phone or personal digital assistant. The widget can connect the player account to a wagering game network or other such gaming venue that can broker the bets between players on the event. In some embodiments the system can be a massively multiplayer online MMO game. The MMO can be an enormous world of gambling on any event based activity or non event activity.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a first wager from the wagering game player account associated with a first potential outcome of the event. In some embodiments the system can wager money items points status services rights virtual assets e.g. virtual trophies or medals collected game items etc. or any other thing that the betting parties value. For instance in the betting console can include betting controls for the player account to place bets. The player account is connected to the social network user account so that the widget can be utilized on the social network website but still have connection to a wagering account. The betting console can also include an outcome control that a player can use to indicate a potential outcome for the event specified in the event control . The system can store bets e.g. money amounts items virtual assets etc. in a secured escrow account until the system can ascertain the outcome of the event and reveal it to the parties or until the parties agree on the outcome using the web widget . The system can then release the funds in the escrow account to the winning party s account. In some embodiments the system can integrate with personal banking accounts non wagering broker accounts financial escrow accounts etc. e.g. integrate with Pay Pal accounts for the betting parties .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a second wager from a second wagering game player account associated with a second potential outcome for the undetermined event. For example the second player account can utilize widget such as the widget in to place bets select potential outcomes etc. The second player account can also be associated with a second social network account.

The flow continues at processing block where the system matches the first wager against the second wager. In some embodiments the system can match the first wager and second wager via a wagering control mechanism e.g. a widget . For example in the player account can specify another e.g. second player account using a challenger control on the web widget . The challenger control can list friends of the player account . The list of friends can be social contacts e.g. social contacts stored by the social network website for the social network user account that have associated player accounts. The system can then match connect broker associate or otherwise determine that the first wager for the player account competes against a second wager for the other player account indicated in the challenger control . The system can function as a broker for the event. In some embodiments the system can connect the player accounts e.g. the player account and the challenger account to a third party account that controls odds or that brokers the bet. The system can also integrate with third party peer to peer applications or with third party websites or services that offer gambling.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines an event outcome for the event and compensates either the first wagering game player account or the second wagering game player account depending on the event outcome. For example in the system can ascertain the outcome of the event and reveal it to the parties. The system can then release the funds in the escrow account to the winning party s account. For instance if the system determines that the outcome matches the potential outcome indicated in the outcome control the system can release the bet e.g. money amount item etc. from the escrow account to the player account . In some embodiments the system may not be able to electronically ascertain an outcome for the event but can determine that the parties agree on an outcome using the web widget e.g. the system accepts a mutual agreement on the outcome from the betting parties and pays out the bet value to the agreed upon winner . Returning now to in some embodiments the system can match up more than two bets e.g. multiple bets groups of bets bets on more than two possible outcomes etc. . In some embodiments the system can determine that there are more than two possible outcomes for an event. For example the first player account can bet on one possible outcome the second player account can bet on a second possible outcome and the third account e.g. a third player account a broker account a casino house account etc. bets against the first and second wager for a third or any alternative outcome. In such a scenario the system can transact a losing result for both the first wager and the second wager but a winning result for the third account.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a non wagering activity indicated by the player account. In some embodiments the non wagering activity can be a social communication activity such as chatting with a friend via the internet posting a blog entry sending a text message making an update to a social network account configuring blog aggregation making a telephone call sending an email etc. . In other embodiments the non wagering activity can be other non wagering activity that the account owner can perform electronically and or that can be reported or tracked e.g. trackable traceable etc. electronically e.g. visiting a website completing a work goal emailing a specific person s making a personal phone call to a specific person s making a sales call making a discounted purchase making a deposit into bank savings account etc. The system can provide a gambling mechanism or device that a player can use to indicate the non wagering activity. In some embodiments the gambling mechanism can be a social network website a social network application a mobile device etc. In some embodiments the gambling mechanism can be a web widget that controls background wagering for the performance of the non wagering activity. For example in the web widget can be used to configure background betting and track non wagering activities. The web widget can also transact bets and or send reports of the non wagering activity to the online gaming server to transact bets. In some embodiments the system can track non wagering activity performance mechanisms such as social communications mechanism e.g. social network websites mobile communication devices website applications communications networks etc. that a player has registered to be monitored for the non wagering activity. For instance the player account can include a social networks console that an account owner can use to register the social network websites and wireless communication networks to monitor for performance of social communication activities e.g. blog posts social network website updates text messages etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a betting amount associated with the non wagering activity. The system can present configuration controls for the player account to use to indicate games on which to bet place bet amounts for a game set pay lines specify game denomination etc. For instance in the system presents a background settings console that includes a non wagering activity control that indicates an activity for which the system will place a micro bet when performed. The background settings console can also include a bet amount control that a player can use to specify an amount to bet per each activity performed specified in the non wagering activity control . The background settings console can also include a game specification control to indicate a game on which to place the bet amount indicated by the bet amount control . The player account can also include a master game selection console with a game addition control that a player can use to select games that appear in dropdowns for the game specification control . The master game selection console can also include controls to set a default game. In some embodiments the system can assign varying betting values to the different activities. For example one setting indicates that when a player sends a text message the system will bet 0.05 which is a lower amount set by the player account as the player may perform that activity more often and may not want to control spending of bets. On the other hand another setting indicates that when a player posts to a blog the system will bet 0.25. In some embodiments the system can enforce a betting limit on the activity and can set up stop activity so that the system stops betting if betting amounts reach a level for an event e.g. a game a number of wins etc. or a period e.g. a gaming session a chatting session a day etc. . For example the background settings console can include a total bet control to specify a limit amount and a period event indicator to specify the event or period for which to monitor the limit amount indicated in the total bet control . In some embodiments the system can determine activities that would raise or lower the limits e.g. system determines that a player authorizes a temporary lift of the limits the system determines that the player has a low average of performing triggering non wagering events per specified period and automatically lifts the limit until the average increases to a predetermined level the system recognizes that the underlying wagering game provides a bet multiplier that increases bet amounts etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines that the player account performs the non wagering activity and transacts a bet on a wagering game on behalf of the player account for the performed non wagering activity. For example the player can perform a social communication activity such as posting a blog comment or sending a text message. The system place a bet for the activity. The system can enable a turn or play for a wagering game e.g. cause a wagering game server to play a game make a spin on a slot game play a hand at poker etc. . For each play or turn the system can send an encrypted message to the wagering game server and select a wagering game specified from the player s settings or select a default game if the player did not specify a specific wagering game. The system can use a bet indicated by the players setting for the non wagering activity and play the turn on the specified game for the bet amount. In some embodiments the system can award bets for performing specific social network activity e.g. a social network website can award micro bets for removing friends from crowded friend lists recruiting new users etc. . The system places or transacts the bet on the wagering game in the background meaning that the player does not perform the betting activities directly nor does the player activate the game play directly. The system automatically causes the bet and game play to occur based on the non wagering activity that the player performed. The system can determine that the player account performs the non wagering activity via electronic tracking For example a wagering game server can electronically determine that a player performs an activity using a client e.g. makes a blog comment by tracking specific activity on the client. The player account may have indicated specific activity to watch for. The system e.g. via a mail server an account server a bank server a communications server etc. may also report activity back to a wagering game server so that the wagering game server can determine that the non wagering activity occurred. Accounts associated with the multiple servers can include user settings that indicate activity that should be monitored and reported.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a wagering game outcome for the wagering game. After the system enables the turn or play the system can determine e.g. generate a game outcome e.g. a win a loss a bonus etc. and communicate the outcome to the player account e.g. via the gambling mechanism . The system can store the wagering game outcome for subsequent viewing and or for record keeping. For example the system can store a specified number of game outcomes e.g. the last 100 game outcomes that the player can access via the gambling mechanism.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines that a player requests notification of the wagering game outcome and presents a representation of the wagering game outcome to the player account. For example the system can determine that the player account accesses the gambling mechanism and requests to view the wagering outcome and any other previous wagering game outcomes. The system can presents a representation e.g. a display a textual description etc. of the wagering game outcome on the gambling mechanism. For example a player may periodically check a web widget and review a history of the background bets and any wins. The player can also access replays of the wins. In some embodiments the system can present a real time display of results counters peripheral indicators etc. In some embodiments the system can only present the results of the background betting and game play when the player account accesses the gambling mechanism e.g. only when a player logs on to a social network website and launches a web widget . In other embodiments the system can notify the player via other means. For instance in the player account may include a notifications console for a player account to specify notification settings. The notifications console can include controls for how when and to whom notifications can be sent e.g. controls to specify that notifications should be sent by widget display text message email etc. controls to specify friends to whom to send the notifications controls to indicate when notifications should be sent etc. 

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a win amount and updates the player account with the win amount. The system can determine if the game outcomes result in wins and can transact the win amounts to the player account. In some embodiments the system can determine that a player s funds are depleted e.g. an account balance is at 0 . The system however can continue to play for the player account and generate wagering game outcomes. The system can in some embodiments lend money to the player to transact the bets. In other embodiments the system determine wins that the player might have won had the account been funded. In some embodiments the system can present gaming history to friends track recruitment of friends award recruitment of friends and so forth.
