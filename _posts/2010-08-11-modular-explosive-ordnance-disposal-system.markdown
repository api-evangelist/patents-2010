title: Modular explosive ordnance disposal system
abstract: A kit of modular explosive ordnance disposal components may include five components. The five components may be assembled in various configurations to fire solid slugs, water shots, or fin-stabilized projectiles. Each assembled configuration may include a first component having a generally cylindrical shape, a through-bore, a muzzle end, and a breech end. The muzzle end of the first component may include external threads. The breech end of the first component may include an internally-threaded portion for receiving a .50 caliber breech plug. A .50 caliber cartridge chamber may be formed adjacent the internally-threaded portion. A bore of about one inch in diameter may extend from the .50 caliber cartridge chamber to the muzzle end of the first component.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Three separate EOD systems may be used by the Army EOD community for firing solid slugs water shot and fin stabilized projectiles. The Mk2 may fire solid slugs. The Mk31 may fire solid slugs or water shot. The Mk40 may fire a fin stabilized projectile. The Mk2 the Mk31 and the Mk40 may each use a .50 caliber electrically actuated blank to provide the propulsive force for accelerating the chosen projectile.

The Mk2 the Mk31 and the Mk40 are three separate EOD systems having very little modularity between them. The Mk2 and the Mk31 may use a common breech plug. To fire water shot solid slugs and fin stabilized projectiles the user must be equipped with at least two of the three EOD systems. A need exists for a light weight modular EOD system that may fire water shot solid slugs and fin stabilized projectiles.

It is an object of the invention to provide a light weight modular EOD system that may fire water shot solid slugs and fin stabilized projectiles.

One aspect of the invention is a kit of modular explosive ordnance disposal components. The kit may include a first component having a generally cylindrical shape a through bore a muzzle end and a breech end. The muzzle end may include external threads. The through bore may include 1 an internally threaded portion at the breech end for threadingly receiving a .50 caliber breech plug 2 a .50 caliber cartridge chamber adjacent the internally threaded portion and 3 a bore of about one inch in diameter extending from the .50 caliber cartridge chamber to the muzzle end.

A second component may have a generally cylindrical shape a through bore a muzzle end and a support end. The muzzle end may include external threads. The through bore of the second component may include 1 an internally threaded portion at the support end for engaging the external threads of the muzzle end of the first component and 2 a bore of about one inch in diameter extending from the internally threaded portion at the support end to the muzzle end.

A third component may have a generally cylindrical shape a through bore a muzzle end and a support end. The through bore of the third component may include 1 an internally threaded portion at the support end for engaging the external threads of the muzzle end of the first component 2 a first bore of less than one inch in diameter adjacent the internally threaded portion and 3 a second bore of about 40 millimeters in diameter extending from the first bore to the muzzle end.

A fourth component may have a generally cylindrical shape for fitting in the bore of the first component a through bore an entrance end and an exit end. The through bore of the fourth component may include a converging diverging nozzle with a diameter of the converging portion at the entrance end being smaller than a diameter of the diverging portion at the exit end. The diameter of the diverging portion at the exit end may be about a same diameter as the diameter of the first bore of the third component.

A fifth component may have a generally cylindrical shape a through bore a first end and a second end. The through bore of the fifth component may include an internally threaded portion at the first end for engaging the external threads at the muzzle end of the first component.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of firing a solid slug. The method may include assembling the first and fifth components of the kit of modular explosive ordnance disposal components.

A further aspect of the invention is a method of firing a water shot. The method may include assembling the first and second components of the kit of modular explosive ordnance disposal components and then firing the water shot.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of firing a fin stabilized projectile. The method may include assembling the first third and fourth components of the kit of modular explosive ordnance disposal components.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A modular EOD system may be in the form of a kit that may contain several components. The components may be combined in various configurations. One configuration may have the functionality of the known Mk2 for example the ability to fire solid slugs. Another configuration may have the functionality of the known Mk31 for example the ability to fire solid slugs and water shot. A third configuration may have the functionality of the known Mk40 for example the ability to fire fin stabilized projectiles.
