This disclosure relates to systems apparatuses and methodologies for obtaining document management services from a document management application that include a plurality of application functions through a network. More specifically a request for an application function is transmitted with focus terms to the document management application.

In the current information age information technology IT tools for managing files and data are extensively used in enterprises and other organizations in order to store and transfer electronic documents and data over a network.

A document management system for example DocumentMall can provide users with remote access that is through a network to software applications and related services that would otherwise have to be installed on the user s local computer. For example such a document management system may be configured to store documents as electronic files in a network connected and secure document storage device in order to protect the documents from theft or loss and to avoid unnecessarily occupying storage space local to the user computer or local computing environment while making such files available on demand. The documents may include voluminous and or sensitive material and may be configured to provide searchable databases of all forms of legal medical financial educational scientific and marketing documents for individuals and or companies via a network.

A conventional document management system typically includes a plurality of application functions such as a document registration function to register a specified document in a document database of the document management system and a search function to search document data in a document storage part of the document management system based on the specified search terms. depicts an example of such a document management system where client terminals through may upload and download documents to from a document storage part of the document management system via the network .

There is a drawback however in that user interfaces for utilizing such application functions of a conventional document management system are often static and inflexible with the same set of rigid options presented to all users. For instance a user of a search user interface is often forced to browse through all of the possible search options that the universe of users may wish to access. This is despite the fact that certain user or groups of users may be interested in consistently utilizing a specific set of services of a search function or other application function of the document management system.

Furthermore there is another drawback in that a search result list of a search function of conventional document management system may not be returned to a user after the search results list is completely compiled but instead the search result list may be continuously updated with further documents in a streaming manner as these further documents are discovered. Thus a user viewing a search results list at a given time may be mistaken as to the completeness of the search results list since the list may continue to be updated with further documents as they are retrieved by the search function of the conventional document management system. Therefore great inconvenience is caused to the user.

There exists a need for an improved document management system which is not as difficult and time consuming to use.

This disclosure provides user interface tools in the form of systems apparatuses methodologies computer program products etc. for obtaining document management services from a document management application including a plurality of application functions through a network.

In an aspect of this disclosure a document access apparatus or application user interface apparatus provides an operations user interface to an application user to show user specific focus parameters determined according to user access information of the application user for a selected application function of the document management application and for the application user to select one or more of the user specific focus parameters of the selected application function and specify parameters values for the selected focus parameters of the selected application function.

In another aspect an application interface part of the application user interface apparatus obtains and registers focus parameter information indicating candidate focus parameters for application functions of a document management application from an application program interface of the document management application upon the login by an application user in a specific session.

In another aspect the operations user interface of the document access apparatus or application user interface apparatus includes a search interface configured for an application user to specify one or more key terms and focus terms for selected search parameters for limiting a search to be performed by a search function of the document management application.

In another aspect the key terms and focus terms are communicated by the application interface part of the document access apparatus or application user interface apparatus through the network to the document management application for a search and no further communications between the application interface part and the operations user interface part is conducted until a set of search results has been received and compiled. The search results are communicated to the operations user interface part only after the search results have been received and compiled.

In another aspect registered focus parameter information is utilised to determine user specific focus parameters of a particular application function upon selection of the particular application function by the application user in the specific session.

In another aspect user specific focus parameters of the selected application function are determined based on user access information of an application user after the application interface part obtains focus parameter information indicating the candidate focus parameters for a selected application function of a document management application from the application program interface of the document management application.

In another aspect user access information is communicated to an application program interface of a document management application upon login by the application user and the application program interface of the document management application determines and returns user specific focus parameters of a particular application function based on the user access information of the application user.

In describing preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner. In addition a detailed description of known functions and configurations will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views shows schematically a system for streamlining access in a document management system according to an exemplary embodiment of this disclosure.

System includes a plurality of client terminals through a document management apparatus and a document access apparatus or also referenced herein as application user interface apparatus all of which are interconnected by a network .

The plurality of client terminals through may be substantially similar to those depicted in . In particular the client terminals through are configured with software allowing the client terminals to communicate through the network with at least the document access apparatus and preferably also the document management apparatus . In particular the client terminals through may transmit data to and receive data from the document access apparatus .

The document management apparatus may be configured to execute a document management application having a plurality of application functions. One of the plurality of application functions may be a document registration function to register a specified document in a document database in a storage part of the document management apparatus for example . Another one of the plurality of application functions may be a search function to search a document database of the document management apparatus based on specified terms such as key terms and focus parameters as will be described below. Another one of the plurality of application functions may be a download function to download specified document data from a document database of the document management apparatus . It should be understood that this list of application functions is not limiting and that other application functions may be featured by a document management system.

The document management apparatus includes an application program interface . The application program interface is configured to specific focus parameter information indicating candidate focus parameters for the application functions of the document management apparatus . That is the application program interface is configured to specify for each specific one of the plurality of application functions candidate focus parameters for the specific application function.

An example of focus parameter information is depicted in . The focus parameter information includes list a plurality of application functions of the document management apparatus such as a document registration function and a search function for example. As explained above many other application functions for a document management system may exist such as a download application function. The focus parameter information further includes candidate focus parameters for each of the plurality of application functions where the candidate focus parameters are all of the focus parameters that may be used in conjunction with an application function.

Focus parameters are parameters that may be used in conjunction with an application function to limit the execution of the application function in some manner. For instance focus parameters may be used with a search function for limiting a search to an extent of data less than all document data in a document data where the search is based on one or more key terms. For example if a user wishes to search for all documents containing the terms boy motorcycle cat and snow then these four words would be key terms of a search. Moreover if the user wished to limit the search only to an extent of data that includes documents with an author X and a creation data of Y then the author and creation date are focus parameters that may limit the search while the terms X and Y are referred to herein as focus parameter values parameter values or focus terms.

Thus in the example of the candidate focus parameters for the document registration function include directory author format account case client docket invoice patient and vendor . The candidate focus parameters for the search function include the above mentioned focus parameters for the document registration function as well as size creation date and modification date.

Returning now to the document access apparatus is configured to communicate through the network with the document management apparatus . Document access apparatus includes a user authentication part an application interface part and an operations user interface part

The user authentication part is configured to maintain for each particular one of a plurality of users user access information corresponding to the particular user.

In addition to maintaining for each particular one of a plurality of users user access information corresponding to the particular user the user authentication part of the document access apparatus is also configured to retrieve the user access information maintained for an application user upon login by the application user.

An example of a login user interface provided by the document access apparatus to an application user is depicted in and includes fields for a user to enter user information that may be used to login the user and authenticate the user. The user information may include a username and user authentication data such as a password. However the user information may instead or in addition include any information that may be used to login identify or authenticate a user of a user terminal that may be in communication with a document management apparatus. For example the user information can include a plurality of names passwords screen names email addresses telephone numbers facsimile numbers etc. The user information may include biometric information such as fingerprints palm prints voice or speech retinas or irises facial expressions or features signature etc .

After the user authentication part utilizes the user information of the specific user to authenticate the specific user the user authentication part also utilizes the user information of the specific user to retrieve the user access information maintained for the specific user. For example the user authentication part may utilize a username of a specific user provided during login of the specific user via the login user interface for example as depicted in to retrieve the user access information as depicted in .

The application interface part of the document access apparatus is configured to communicate through the network with the application program interface of the document management apparatus to obtain the focus parameter information indicating the candidate focus parameters for the application functions of the document management apparatus . An example of focus parameter information is depicted in as described above.

The operations user interface part of the document access apparatus is configured to provide an operations user interface to a user of the document access apparatus .

In order to receive user selection of an application function of the document management apparatus after the login of the user the operations user interface provided by the operations user interface part includes a function selection user interface. An example of a function selection user interface is depicted in and the function selection user interface is provided to accept a user selection of an application function such as a user selection of a search function as seen in .

The operations user interface part is further configured to determine user specific focus parameters which are focus parameters for a specific user when utilizing a particular application function such as a search function of a document management apparatus. In an embodiment of this disclosure the operations user interface part determines the user specific focus parameters based on a the user access information for a particular user that has logged into the document access apparatus and b the focus parameter information for an application function selected by the specific user. In particular the determination may be made based on various aspects of the user access information such as the business relevancy information.

For example if the user John.Smith has logged in via login user interface in for example then the operations user interface part may refer to the user access information for the username John.Smith. The operations user interface part may determine that the business relevancy information for John.Smith indicates a Legal business relevancy field as depicted in .

If the user John.Smith then selects a search application function of the document management apparatus via the function selection user interface in for example then the operations user interface part may refer to the focus parameter information for the search application function as depicted in . The focus parameter information may be obtained from the document management apparatus . The focus parameter information for the search function indicates a number of candidate focus parameters such as directory author size format and so forth.

Based on this business relevancy information and focus parameter information the operations user interface part is able to determine user specific focus parameters. That is since the username John.Smith has a Legal business relevancy field the operations user interface part may determine that the user specific focus parameters for the search function are directory author size format creation date modification data case client and docket . On the other hand if the user had an Accounting relevancy field then the operations user interface part may determine that the user specific focus parameters for the search function are directory author size format creation date modification date account invoice and vendor . If necessary the focus parameter information may include further information indicating the business relevancy field to which each candidate focus parameter corresponds to as depicted in .

Thus the operations user interface part determines user specific focus parameters which are focus parameters for a specific user when utilizing a particular application function of a document management apparatus. Since the focus parameter information is stored and maintained locally at the document management apparatus side the focus parameter information may be updated to reflect changes and features of the document management apparatus such as new application functions. These changes may be made without having to amend any information regarding the access rights of all the users of the document management apparatus since the user access information is stored and maintained locally at the document access apparatus side. Thus the application functions of a given document management apparatus such as document management apparatus may be enjoyed be a first discrete set of users via a first document access apparatus and a second different set of users via a second document access apparatus. Similarly a given set of users registered with a document access apparatus such as document access apparatus may enjoy the different application functions of different document management apparatuses.

Returning to the operations user interface part is configured to provide an operations user interface through the network to a user terminal such as one of the plurality of terminals through or a multi function device. The operations user interface is configured to show the user specific focus parameters described above and allows the user to select one or more of the user specific focus parameters and also specify parameter values for the selected focus parameters.

The operations user interface may take one of several forms depending on an application functionality selected by the user. For example if the selected application function is a search function then the operations user interface includes a search interface configured for the application user to specify one or more key terms as well as select focus parameters from the user specific focus parameters and parameter values for the selected focus parameters.

An example of a search interface provided by the operations user interface part is depicted in . It may be seen that the user is searching for documents and document data of the document management apparatus that includes all of the words boy motorcycle cat and snow . Thus the key terms in this case are boy motorcycle cat and snow .

In the example of the selected user specific focus parameters include Directory Author Size and Format and the corresponding parameter values for the selected user specific focus parameters are G XYZ Jim.Alpha 100 KB and Microsoft Word respectively. It may be seen that the search interface allows the user to select from user specific focus parameters such as Directory Author Size and Format using pull down option menus. The user can edit the parameter values via pull down menus as shown in of via text keyboard entry.

The application interface part of the document access apparatus communicates the key terms and any focus terms for selected focus parameters i.e. selected user specific focus parameters along with the corresponding parameter values to the document management application for the search. According to this embodiment after the application interface part communicates this information the application interface part does not communicate with the operations user interface part again until a set of search results has been received from the document management apparatus and fully compiled. The application interface part communicates the search results to the operations user interface part only after the search results have been received and compiled. At this point the operations user interface part may present the search results to the user.

Thus according to this exemplary embodiment of the present invention there is provided the tools for the efficient exchange and management of documents and files and for streamlining access in a document management system. Whereas conventional techniques typically do not communicate search request to the user only after all the search results have been received and complied the document access apparatus of this disclosure communicates search results to a user only after the entire set of search results has been received and compiled.

The document access apparatus may be embodied as a server that is distinct from the document management apparatus . In this way the document access apparatus may correspond to a first server and the document management apparatus may correspond to a second server separate and physically distinct from the first server. Hence while conventional document management systems typically have an integrated user interface such that any modification of the user interface would require taking the document management system offline the document access apparatus of this disclosure is configured for modification without taking the document management apparatus offline.

While the focus parameter information is generally maintained by the document management apparatus the focus parameter information may also be maintained by the document access apparatus itself. Similarly while the user access information is generally maintained by the document access apparatus the user access information may also be maintained by the document management apparatus .

According to an aspect of this disclosure the operations user interface part determines not only the user specific focus parameters but also the extent of the parameter values that may be selected by the user in relation to a user specific focus parameter. For example if the user specific focus parameter is Directory location the operations user interface part may determine the available parameter values for this focus parameter based on the user access information.

With reference to there is shown an example of a search interface having the above mentioned aspects of this disclosure. In particular the search interface includes user specific focus parameters for a search function for a user having a legal business relevancy field. As is clear in one of the user specific focus parameters is the Directory focus parameter and the operations user interface part has determined and provided the appropriate parameter values based on the legal business relevancy field of the user. The information of the particular directories may be obtained from the document management apparatus . depicts how the other user specific parameter values have also been determined based on the legal business relevancy field of the user i.e. the user specific focus parameters include client docket and case .

In there is shown another example of a search interface this time including user specific focus parameters for a search function for a user having an accounting business relevancy field. As is clear in one of the user specific focus parameters is the Directory focus parameter and the operations user interface part has determined and provided the appropriate parameter values based on the accounting business relevancy field of the user. The information of the particular directories may be obtained from the document management apparatus . depicts how the other user specific parameter values have also been determined based on the accounting business relevancy field of the user i.e. the user specific focus parameters may include account invoice and vendor .

While the determination of the user specific focus parameters has been described as taking place at the document access apparatus side the determination of the user specific focus parameters may also take place at the document management apparatus side as long as the document management apparatus is able to obtain the user access information.

According to another aspect of this disclosure the user specific focus parameters are determined only on the basis of the focus parameter information for example all the candidate focus parameters are treated as the user specific focus parameters.

According to another aspect of this disclosure the user specific focus parameters are determined only on the basis of the user access information. For example the user access information may include document parameters information as seen in which identifies predetermined focus parameters that will constitute the user specific focus parameters for all application functions. Such document parameters information may be set by a systems administrator for example.

According to another aspect of this disclosure the user access information may include data access information indicating an extent of data accessible by the user and this information may be used by the operations user interface part to determine parameter values for the user selected focus parameters. With reference to the user access information for for example it can be seen that the user John.Smith is only permitted to access document databases A B and C. Thus the parameter values for a Directory user specific focus parameter as seen in for example may be controlled to only include databases corresponding to A B and C. The data access information may be included in the user access information as described above or may be stored separately as access control information including an access control list as depicted in .
