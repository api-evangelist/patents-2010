title: Method for reducing flow induced vibration and noise in towed arrays
abstract: A method for reducing noise in a towed acoustic array includes providing a towed array having a length, diameter, frequency range and tow speed. The relationship between tension in the towed array and wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels is determined. Wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels are related to the noise in the array. An optimal towed array tension is calculated using the determined relationship. Tension is increased to the optimal towed array tension by either provided additional towed array hose or a drogue at the end of the towed array.

The present invention generally relates to a towed acoustic sensor array. More particularly this invention relates to a method for operating a towed acoustic sensor array.

Naval vessels and geophysical exploration vessels routinely deploy towed acoustic arrays for analyzing undersea structures and objects. Improving signal to noise ratio is critical for these array. This can be increased by decreasing noise sources in the towed acoustic array. A standard towed array deployment is shown in . A tow vessel is provided having a tow cable joined to a towed array . Towed array is below a water surface . As tow vessel moves in the direction indicated by arrow with velocity V the towed array is subjected to surface friction along length Lcreating a force F in the direction shown by arrow . This results in a tension in towed array . It is understood that tow vessel can be a surface or subsurface vessel.

Flow noise is an important component of towed array noise. Flow noise in towed arrays can result from bulge waves and extensional waves propagating in the hose wall and also from convective energy due to the turbulent boundary layer. These all have a well defined distribution of energy across stream wise wavenumber at a given frequency and also a well defined propagation speed.

The turbulent boundary layer developed over the surface of a towed array and vortex shedding induced during turns are primary sources of flow noise. Standard towed array design is aimed at filtering energy from the turbulent boundary layer using a combination of hydrophone size hydrophone grouping and the stand off distance between the hydrophone and the hose wall of the array. These methods are effective for filtering energy which exists at higher wavenumbers than acoustic energy at low wavenumbers.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for reducing flow noise that results in an array that can be easily handled.

These and other objects are achieved by this method for reducing noise in a towed acoustic array. The method includes providing a towed array having a length diameter frequency range and tow speed. The relationship between tension in the towed array and wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels is determined. Wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels generate the noise in the array. An optimal towed array tension is calculated using the determined relationship. Tension is increased to the optimal towed array tension by either provided additional towed array hose or a drogue at the end of the towed array.

Recently tow tests have been performed with a customized experimental towed array instrumented with sensors to measure mechanical and hydrodynamic forces. The wavenumber frequency spectra measured with internal hydrophones and also with wall pressure sensors mounted in the array hose wall have shown high auto spectral levels at low frequencies. For purposes of this disclosure low frequencies are defined as frequencies below 100 Hz. This energy is broadly distributed across all of the measured stream wise wavenumbers and has no apparent speed of propagation. This type of energy has also been measured with different types of pressure sensors in other towed arrays with different mounting characteristics. Incoherent vibration of the sensors in the array can create this type of energy. Recent measurements made using three axis accelerometers internally mounted in the experimental array showed high auto spectral levels due to accelerations in the plane orthogonal to the array axis and somewhat lower spectral levels along the axis in the low frequency range. Measurements made during tow ship turns showed significant increases in both the pressure and acceleration spectral levels.

The recent measurements cited here show flow induced energy which exists across all wavenumbers at lower frequencies. The primary data originated from two tests. provides a graph of this data. The graph plots spectral energy 

Here we propose an algorithm which enables determination of a specified required noise reduction for a given array geometry. Parameters include length diameter frequency range and nominal tow speed. This algorithm is based on experimental data showing the relationship between array tension T and wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels f which may be given in the form

Accordingly this invention should not be limited by any of the specifically shown embodiments. In light of the above it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
