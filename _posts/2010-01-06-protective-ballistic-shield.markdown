The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to protective shields and in particular to shields for protection from ballistic threats.

Some mounted machine guns and artillery pieces may be equipped with metal armor plates to protect the gunners from sniper fire and shrapnel from explosions. Some gun shields may be improvised in the field using salvaged metal plates. In the Vietnam War the crews of some armored fighting vehicles and PT Boats would affix metal plates to their machine guns. After the Vietnam War gun shields fell out of widespread use.

Modern battlegrounds are filled with weapon fire. The weapon fire presents a grave risk to soldiers who may be exposed when firing at the enemy. The weapon fire may include incoming fire from elevated precision fire weapons and ground born threats such as mines and improvised explosive devices. In particular many casualties are hit in areas not protected by body armor or helmets such as the neck or face. A disadvantage of gun shields may be that they limit the visibility of the user. In the case of vehicle mounted guns gun shields may also adversely affect the performance of tasks other than firing a gun.

Military tanks such as the Abrams tank may include a turret with one or more hatches. On the Abrams one of the turret hatches is located at the tank commander s station. Mounted adjacent the tank commander s hatch may be a weapon such as a .50 caliber machine gun. When using the .50 caliber machine gun the tank commander may be vulnerable to enemy fire. A need exists for a protective shield for the operator of the weapon at the tank commander s station.

It is another object of the invention to provide a protective shield configured for the tank commander s station of a tank.

One aspect of the invention may be a protective shield. The protective shield may include an inboard shield assembly and an outboard shield assembly. The inboard shield assembly may include an inboard shield and an inboard base. The inboard shield may include a forward plate fixed at an angle to a center plate and a rear plate fixed at an angle to the center plate. The center plate may include a window opening and a window fixed over the window opening.

The outboard shield assembly may include an outboard shield and an outboard base. The outboard shield may include a forward plate fixed at an angle to a center plate and a rear plate fixed at an angle to the center plate. The center plate may include a window opening and a window fixed over the window opening. A splice plate may connect portions of the inboard and outboard bases.

The inboard base may include a circular member having a generally planar upper surface and a plurality of base supports extending from a lower surface of the circular member. The outboard base may include a circular member having a generally planar upper surface and a plurality of base supports extending from a lower surface of the circular member. The forward plate center plate and rear plate of the inboard shield may each be substantially planar and the forward plate center plate and rear plate of the outboard shield may each be substantially planar.

Each of the base supports for the inboard base and the outboard base may include a boss inserted in an opening in the inboard base circular member or the outboard base circular member.

The shield may include an inboard shield sill having a generally horizontal upper surface. The inboard sill may be attached to an interior of the inboard shield. An outboard shield sill may have a generally horizontal upper surface and may be attached to an interior of the outboard shield.
