Penicillin binding proteins PBPs are a group of enzymes involved in assembly of the cell wall in both gram negative and gram positive bacteria. They are characterized by their affinity for and binding of penicillin. There are a large number of PBPs usually several in each organism and are found as both membrane bound and cytoplasmic proteins.

Accordingly new compounds and compositions are needed that are capable of inhibiting bacteria such as antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. New compounds and compositions that can be used to treat bacterial infections are also needed. Additionally a model for screening and identifying anti bacterial agents against evolving new bacterial strains would aid researchers in treating infectious diseases such as those caused by antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.

The invention provides compounds and compositions capable of inhibiting or killing bacteria such as antibiotic resistant bacteria including vancomycin resistant bacteria and or treating a bacterial infection. Methods for screening and identifying active compounds are also provided. Thus the invention provides compositions that include an active ingredient which can be an antibiotic or combination of antibiotic agents effective to inhibit a microorganism such as a bacterium and or an antibiotic resistant organism such as MRSA. The active agents can also be effective for treating or inhibiting penicillin binding proteins PBPs . The active agents can be one or more compounds of Formulas I X.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to include an amount of a compound described herein or an amount of the combination of compounds described herein e.g. to treat or prevent the disease or disorder or to treat the symptoms of the disease or disorder in a host. The combination of compounds is preferably a synergistic combination. Synergy as described for example by Chou and Talalay 22 27 1984 occurs when the effect of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent. In general a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity increased activity or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components.

The terms therapy and therapeutic refer to either treatment or prevention thus agents that either treat damage or prevent damage are therapeutic. 

The terms treating treat and treatment include i preventing a disease pathologic or medical condition from occurring e.g. prophylaxis ii inhibiting the disease pathologic or medical condition or arresting its development iii relieving the disease pathologic or medical condition and or iv diminishing symptoms associated with the disease pathologic or medical condition. Thus the terms treat treatment and treating extend to prophylaxis and include prevent prevention preventing lowering stopping or reversing the progression or severity of the condition or symptoms being treated. As such the term treatment includes both medical therapeutic and or prophylactic administration as appropriate.

In addition where features or aspects of the invention are described in terms of Markush groups those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group. For example if X is described as selected from the group consisting of bromine chlorine and iodine claims for X being bromine and claims for X being bromine and chlorine are fully described. Moreover where features or aspects of the invention are described in terms of Markush groups those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is also thereby described in terms of any combination of individual members or subgroups of members of Markush groups. Thus for example if X is described as selected from the group consisting of bromine chlorine and iodine and Y is described as selected from the group consisting of methyl ethyl and propyl claims for X being bromine and Y being methyl are fully described.

In various embodiments the compound or set of compounds such as are used in the inventive methods can be any one of any of the combinations and or sub combinations of the embodiments recited herein.

Asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the compounds described. All such isomers including diastereomers and enantiomers as well as the mixtures thereof are intended to be included in the scope of the recited compound. In certain cases compounds can exist in tautomeric forms. All tautomeric forms are intended to be included in the scope. Likewise when compounds contain an alkenyl or alkenylene group there exists the possibility of cis and trans isomeric forms of the compounds. Both cis and trans isomers as well as the mixtures of cis and trans isomers are contemplated. Thus reference herein to a compound includes all of the aforementioned isomeric forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Various forms are included in the embodiments including polymorphs solvates hydrates conformers salts and prodrug derivatives. A polymorph is a composition having the same chemical formula but a different structure. A solvate is a composition formed by solvation the combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute . A hydrate is a compound formed by an incorporation of water. A conformer is a structure that is a conformational isomer. Conformational isomerism is the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but different conformations conformers of atoms about a rotating bond. Salts of compounds can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example salts can be prepared by reacting the appropriate base or acid with a stoichiometric equivalent of a compound. A prodrug is a compound that undergoes biotransformation chemical conversion before exhibiting its pharmacological effects. For example a prodrug can thus be viewed as a drug containing specialized protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate undesirable properties in the parent molecule. Thus reference herein to a compound includes all of the aforementioned forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

The invention provides compositions that include an active ingredient e.g. a compound as described herein capable of inhibiting microorganisms such as bacteria particularly vancomycin resistant bacteria. The invention also provides methods for screening and identifying these active ingredients.

In one embodiment the method for screening and identifying an antibacterial compound comprises selecting agents having affinity for one or more penicillin binding proteins PBPs present on the surface of bacteria. For example such PBPs are found on a class of bacteria known in the phylum . By way of example member bacteria within this phylum include such as such as and such as .

The invention thus provides a method for selecting compounds that are capable of binding and therefore inhibiting bacterial species linked to disease and thereby inhibit and or eliminate bacterial infection. Among other advantages the methods provide a technique for identifying specific antibacterial compounds and classes of compounds that bind to strains of bacteria that have become resistant to conventional pharmaceutical agents.

Several functional assays have been used in the present screening and selection methods including in vitro screening methods that demonstrate the activity of the compound against vancomycin resistant methicillin resistant . Since PBPs are related to other proteins of interest in bacteria the methodology is versatile in screening for additional activities. These activities include inhibiting lactamase enzymes. Lactamases are responsible for bacterial resistance to lactam antibiotics. For example lactamases can destroy the activity of lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins etc. If these deleterious enzymes are inhibited lactam antibiotics can be used for treatment of bacterial strains that harbor lactamases. There are four classes of lactamases. Class B is zinc dependent. Classes A C and D are serine dependent. Representative members of class A C and D lactamases are TEM 1 P99 and OXA 10 enzymes respectively. As described in the Examples below compounds of the invention inhibit these enzymes.

As discussed above PBP 2a is a factor in converting a standard strain into the problematic MRSA. Furthermore MRSA is also able to produce its own class A lactamase. Both production of the lactamase and PBP 2a are inducible events mediated by the protein B1aR and the related MecR . The surface domain of B1aR is the lactam sensor domain and is related structurally to lactamases and PBPs. Assays for inhibition of B1aR and PBP2a are described herein. These and other assays have been employed to select the most promising of candidates from a library of chemical compounds.

The invention thus provides compounds and compositions that are effective to inhibit antibiotic resistant organisms such as MRSA. The compounds and compositions in some embodiments can also inhibit penicillin binding proteins PBPs . In some embodiments the compositions include one or more compounds such as one or more compounds of the Formulas described herein.

A screening method for identifying antibiotics having affinity to bacteria is also disclosed. In some embodiments the method employs as an active agent a compound of one of the Formulas described herein. Upon selection of a candidate compound from a chemical library of compounds the selection being based on chemical structure similarity to one of the chemical core structure of Formulas I X the compound is assessed for activity in one or more functional assays that assess biological inhibitory activity for a microorganism such as a bacterial organism. By way of example such biological inhibitory activity may be assessed though the use of a TEM assay P99 assay OXA10 assay B1aR assay or PBP2 assay as described herein and or as can be carried out by techniques well known to those of skill in the art.

Compounds of the invention can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical compositions for administration to subjects such as humans for example in a biologically compatible form for administration in vivo. Accordingly in certain embodiments a pharmaceutical composition is provided that includes compounds as described herein admixed with a suitable diluent or carrier. Suitable diluents or carriers include saline or aqueous dextrose for example a 5 aqueous dextrose solution. Such formulations can be prepared so that they are isotonic with human fluids such as blood or various tissue environments. In certain embodiments it may also be desirable to prepare hypertonic or hypotonic preparations. In other embodiments the composition can be prepared and used for in vitro experimentation for example in various screens and diagnostic procedures.

Suitable vehicles are described for example in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 2003 20Ed. in The United States Pharmacopeia The National Formulary USP 24 NF 19 published in 1999 and in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives compiled by Michael and Irene Ash Gower Publishing Limited Aldershot England 1995 . On this basis the compositions include albeit not exclusively solutions of the compounds in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents as well as buffered solutions with a suitable pH that are iso osmotic with physiological fluids. In this regard reference can be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5 843 456 Paoletti et al. .

The compounds described herein can be administered to a subject in a variety of forms depending on the route of administration selected as is readily understood by those of skill in the art. The compounds can be administered for example by oral parenteral buccal sublingual nasal rectal patch pump or transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions formulated accordingly. Parenteral administration includes intravenous intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular intrasternal transepithelial nasal intrapulmonary intrathecal rectal and infusion modes of administration. Parenteral administration may be carried out by continuous infusion over a selected period of time.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Dimethyl acetamide surfactants including ionic and non ionic detergents polyethylene glycols can be used. Mixtures of solvents and wetting agents can also be useful.

This Example demonstrates screening methods for the identification and selection of compounds effective for treating inhibiting and or killing bacteria such as antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The screening methods include using TEM 1 P99 OXA 10 B1aR and PBP2a assay protocols. TEM 1 P99 and OXA 10 are representative members of class A class C and class D lactamases. B1aR and PBP2a are penicillin binding proteins. B1aR is a key lactam antibiotic sensor signal transducer involved in manifestation of antibiotic resistance in certain Gram positive bacteria including MRSA. In Table 10 for the results of the PBP2a assays the term X refers to an inhibitory concentration of about 5 to about 1 mM the term XX refers to an inhibitory concentration of about 1 to about 0.1 mM and the term XXX refers to an inhibitory concentration of less than about 0.1 mM.

 Lactamase Assays TEM 1 P99 and OXA 10 The activity of the compounds of the invention inhibitors toward lactamases was evaluated using 96 well plates. The reaction mixture included 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 150 mM sodium chloride 0.01 Triton X 100 100 M nitrocefin 10 nM of lactamases class A TEM 1 class C P99 or class D OXA 10 and variable concentrations of the inhibitors in a total volume of 100 L. Lactamases were pre incubated with the compounds at room temperature for 5 minutes and the assay was initiated by the addition of nitrocefin. The inhibition of the enzyme activity by the compounds was determined by monitoring color change from yellow to red of nitrocefin after 20 minutes. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO . No more than 5 DMSO was present in assays unless noted otherwise. B1aR Assay The surface domain of B1aR 1 M was added to each inhibitor at various concentrations in 100 mM sodium phosphate 50 mM sodium bicarbonate at pH 7.0. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. BOCILLIN FL a fluorogenic ligand was added to a concentration of 20 M in a final volume of 20 L. The mixtures were incubated at 37 C. for 5 minutes at which point the reactions were quenched by the addition of 15 L of the SDS sample buffer 125 mM Tris 4 SDS 20 glycerol 2 2 mercaptoethanol pH 6.8 and were boiled for 4 minutes. The samples were loaded onto 15 SDS PAGE the gel was developed and scanned using a Storm 840 Fluorimager. The fluorescent bands of BOCILLIN FL labeled B1aRwere analyzed by Image Quant 5.2 software. PBP2 Assay The PBP2 assay was performed according to the methods of Villegas Esterada et al. 2008 130 9212 9213 .

This example identifies if inhibitory activity was detected at a 25 g mL dose of a compound selected examples of Compounds 1 414 illustrated above after Table 10 against the bacteria examined. The symbol indicates activity against the bacterial while the term indicates there was no observed inhibitory activity. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs of antibiotics were determined by the micro dilution procedure in Mueller Hinton II Broth BBL in accordance with recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute see Bou et al in 2007 391 29 49 Springer Protocols Springer Science Business Media LLC Secaucus N.J. USA . Final bacterial inoculum was 5 10CFU mL. Inoculated micro titer plates were incubated at 35 C. for 24 hours prior to results being recorded.

Table 11 illustrates data showing that minimal inhibitory concentrations were generally observed at 25 mg mL. On top of each cell is the corresponding compound . The sign below the number indicates growth or no growth at 25 g mL. The compounds were dissolved in 100 DMSO to a concentration of 2 000 f mL and transferred to Mueller Hinton broth 200 L to a final concentration of 25 g mL final DMSO in this case is 1.25 . The compounds that were not readily soluble at concentration of 2 000 g mL were diluted in DMSO to 1 000 f mL and transferred 5 L instead of 2.5 L to Mueller Hinton broth for a final concentration in DMSO of 2.5 .

In another test the compounds were dissolved in 80 DMSO plus 20 of buffer 100 mM sodium Phosphate 0.5 NaCO to 2 000 g mL and the minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by diluting the compounds to 40 g mL or lower. However the resulting minimal inhibitory concentrations were the same as from DMSO when the minimal inhibitory concentrations were in Mueller Hinton broth or Mueller Hinton broth supplemented with one fifth of buffer 100 mM sodium Phosphate 0.5 NaCO . The minimal inhibitory concentrations were also determined under the above conditions but compounds were first transferred from 2 000 g mL of DMSO to buffer 100 mM sodium Phosphate 0.5 NaCO to make a final concentration of 800 g mL. However because some compounds separated from the buffer solution they were transferred to Mueller Hinton to arrive at 40 g mL and lower. The resulting minimal inhibitory concentrations were higher in comparison to two conditions described above.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations were also determined for the compounds against NRS11 Mec or NRS100 Mec data not shown . Mecrefers to methicillin sensitive and Mecrefers to the resistant variant of . In determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs against NRS11 Mec or NRS100 Mec the compounds were dissolved in 100 DMSO to a concentration of 1 000 g mL and diluted directly into Mueller Hinton II Broth to final 16 g mL for MIC testing.

This example demonstrates the inhibition of various bacterial strains by selected compounds of the invention. Table 12 illustrates the results and the minimal inhibitory concentration MIC for and . The inoculum is about 1.5 10CFU mL. The minimal inhibitory concentrations MIC were done in Muller Hinton II Broth with the exception of ATCC 29212 which was done in Brain Heart Infusion Broth. The concentration of DMSO at 200 g mL was 10 .
