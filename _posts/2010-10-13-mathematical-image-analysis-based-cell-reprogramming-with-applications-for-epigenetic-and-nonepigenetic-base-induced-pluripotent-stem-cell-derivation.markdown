This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 278 992 filed on Oct. 13 2009 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. NIH 1 RO1 EB006161 01A2 awarded by the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB and under Grant No. FAMRI 26 3401 2150 awarded by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs hold enormous promise for cell therapy in tissue engineering and for the study of disease. This promise is due to the ability to create pluripotent embryonic stem like cells from any genetic source. Patient specific immuno matched cells can be chosen as the parent cell line for reprogramming into iPSCs. The iPSCs are then used to create cells and tissues that a patient tolerates without rejection. The iPSCs can also be derived from patients with genetic diseases for use in the discovery of disease mechanisms and treatments. Like other pluripotent stem cells iPSCs can be used to create heart brain retina liver and cells of other tissues for testing drug candidates assessing efficacy of drugs and or uncovering toxic effects of drug candidates at an earlier state in the drug development process.

It is possible to derive iPSCs from differentiated cells for example by using transcription factors to turn on genes that were expressed in stem cells but later silenced in the differentiated cells. Gene silencing represents one type of epigenetic change or change to phenotype or gene expression caused by mechanisms beyond the underlying DNA sequence. If epigenetic changes associated with cell differentiation could be reversed then the frequency and rate of pluripotent cell induction could be increased and the safety and efficiency of producing iPSC colonies would be improved. For example safety can be improved by reducing the probability of producing cancerous cells Okita et al. 2007 .

In addition there remains a need for determining whether and when iPSCs have been successfully derived from differentiated cells. Because there are distinct intermediate stages between the differentiated and pluripotent states which differ in morphology it is possible to image the cell population and use mathematical image analysis to determine which state the cells in the image have reached. In combination with epigenetic manipulations of cells the image analysis offers a powerful method for deriving and evaluating a useful population of iPSCs with increased speed and efficacy.

A scalable verifiable method for identifying pluripotency in a non destructive and non invasive manner would be ideal for deriving rare iPSCs from somatic cells or for quality control of large numbers of hESC colonies intended for cell therapy. At present methods for human hESC classification are limited to visual inspection of live cells by a trained microscopist or biochemical or immunochemical staining. While visual observation using brightfield or phase contrast microscopy is non invasive it is time consuming non quantitative and cannot be scaled up for the large quantity of cells expected in a therapeutic or commercial setting. Likewise while biochemical staining of hESCs is consistent quantitative and automatable it is destructive and renders the sample unfit for therapeutic use Sammak et al. 2008 . Live cell fluorescent markers can be used to recognize nascent iPSC colonies Chan et al. 2009 but are invasive requiring addition of extracellular or membrane permanent dyes that have limited application in kinetic assays because of dye loss over time. Furthermore fluorescent dyes and methods for detecting such dyes may damage photosensitive cells. Further accurate quality control requires a measure of the homogeneity of cell morphology which is nearly impossible to perform visually for a very large numbers of cell culture plates. In contrast morphological measurements could serve as end point indicators of cell pluripotency or differentiation and provide real time measurement of the experimental agents on cells.

The present invention provides improved methods for identifying induced pluripotent stem cells. These improved methods of identifying iPSCs can be used for example to distinguish iPSCs from terminally and or partially differentiated cells to assess and optimize methods of deriving iPSCs from somatic cells to facilitate compound screening and to facilitate the understanding of methods and techniques for modulating the differentiation state of cells. The various features and embodiments of the imaging and other identification methods described herein can be combined.

Note that this aspect of the invention may be combined with any of the imaging detection and quantification methods described herein.

The disclosure contemplates all combinations of any of the foregoing aspects and embodiments as well as combinations with any of the embodiments set forth in the detailed description and examples.

Before continuing to describe the present invention in further detail it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific compositions or process steps as such may vary. It must be noted that as used in this specification and the appended claims the singular form a an and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention is related.

The methods of the present application may be applied to identification of induced pluripotent stem cells based on morphological features and other molecular characteristics that distinguish these cells from differentiated cells. The methods use statistical classification methods such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 711 174 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 321 360 both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The methods of the present application have broad applicability to the field of regenerative medicine by for example providing automated methods for the high throughput analysis and identification of iPSCs. The methods disclosed herein may also be applied to automated classification of high throughput production of stem cell colonies and embryoid bodies. For example assessing differentiation states of stem cell aggregates Ungrin et al. 2008 has application to teratomas in vivo Bhagavatula et al. 2010 . By way of further example zebrafish and other embryos may be used for drug screening Vogt et al. 2009 . Automated non invasive stem cell classification according to the disclosed methods can be used to advance screening for small molecules that affect development of specific lineages Bushway et al. 2006 Huang et al. 2008 Ichida et al. 2009 Zong Yun et al. 2010 Huangfu et al. 2008 Fazzio et al. 2008 as well as a tool in toxicology studies of compounds and drugs which inhibit or promote stem cell development Seiler et al. 2004 Sinha 2005 Chang et al. 2004 or affect specific lineages such as hepatocytes Gareth et al. 2009 cardiomyocytes or neurons Schrattenholz et al. 2007 derived from iPSCs or hESCs Cezar 2007 .

Image based methodology serves as a statistical and quantitative support aid for biologists and clinicians engaged in growing maintaining and analyzing hESCs or iPSCs with the potential for automated image acquisition and analysis to autonomously assess and monitor the degree of pluripotency in a non destructive manner. Quantitative texture based statistics are a suitable non invasive non destructive biomarker. The methods described herein have broad applicability to the field of regenerative medicine and can be used for example to identify and optimize the production and identification of iPSCs from any somatic cell type from any species including humans.

Deriving a reliable population of iPSCs is the first step to unlocking the potential of iPSCs for cell therapy and treatment of disease. One approach detailed herein makes use of the different epigenetic regulation of differentiated cells versus pluripotent cells. In some embodiments deriving iPSCs according to the described methods leads to more efficient iPSC derivation meaning higher quantities of iPSCs obtained at a faster rate with an increased probability of obtaining and identifying healthy cells.

iPSCs are currently made by transforming somatic cells with four transcription factors cMyc KLF4 Oct4 Sox2 MKOS which induce pluripotency by dedifferentiating or reprogramming differentiated cells to return to primitive lineages. The reprogramming of cell phenotype does not require a change in genetic identity of the cells because the requirement for ectopic gene expression is transient. Moreover once iPSCs are produced the cells rely only on expression of endogenous genes. Thus the change in differentiation state produced during reprogramming using current methods is mediated by a change in gene expression rather than gene structure.

In some embodiments the method of re expressing the long silenced genes required for pluripotency is achieved by epigenetic mechanisms that affect expression by reversing the persistent silencing of genes in heterochromatin. In one embodiment enzymes that affect methylation dependent gene silencing in heterochromatin are manipulated. In other embodiments key molecules associated with gene silencing are manipulated in order to identify other targets that will help to improve the process of reprogramming. Any one or more of the foregoing may be used to produce pluripotent cells such as to generate iPSCs from somatic cells. Moreover the imaging and analytical methods described herein may be used to identify cells that have dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state as well as to follow the progress of dedifferentiation in real time. In certain embodiments of any of the foregoing such imaging and analytical methods are non destructive and non invasive.

In some embodiments reprogramming of fibroblasts or other somatic cells is accomplished by evaluating genes found in pluripotent cells and transforming cells with ectopic genes. Previously a minimal set of four transcription factors was found necessary for inducing pluripotency in differentiated cells Okita et al. 2007 Takahashi et al. 2006 . One method of introducing the genes is through viral introduction of cMyc Klf4 Oct4 and Sox2 MKOS Takahashi et al. 2006 Park et al. 2009 Park et al. 2008 or introduction of OCT4 SOX2 NANOG and LIN28 Yu et al. 2007 . While ectopic genes have been introduced by viral transformation Zeng et al. 2009 and by non viral methods including plasmid transfection Okita et al. 2008 the reversible PiggyBac vector PB MKOS system Zeng et al. 2009 Okita et al. 2008 and recombinant proteins may be added directly to induce pluripotency without introducing ectopic genes Zhou et al. 2009 . Small molecules that have signaling activity Marson et al. 2008 or that alter epigenetics have been used to increase efficiency or to reduce the number of ectopic genes that are needed for reprogramming Feng et al. 2009 Shi et al. 2008 . Environmental changes alone are sufficient to increase expression of endogenous pluripotency markers in fibroblasts Page et al. 2009 showing that media composition is important and may be optimized for reprogramming. Any one or more of the foregoing may be used to produce pluripotent cells such as to generate iPSCs from somatic cells. Additionally combinations of any of these methods such as introduction of transcription factors using viruses and a method based on modification of epigenetic feature s may be used to produce pluripotent cells such as to generate iPSCs from somatic cells. Moreover the imaging and analytical methods described herein may be used to identify cells that have dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state as well as to follow the progress of dedifferentiation in real time. In certain embodiments of any of the foregoing such imaging and analytical methods are non destructive and non invasive.

In some embodiments the inhibition of histone deacetylases HDACs by valproic acid Zhou et al. 2009 may improve reprogramming efficiency. Further drug inhibition of HDACs by butrate or trichostatin A TSA activates a self renewal program in hESC that is independent of feeders or recombinant growth factors Ware et al. 2009 . Inhibition of histone deacetylation and subsequent methylation by more selective methods reveals the interconnection between reprogramming and heterochromatin stability.

One aspect of the present application describes a method for producing iPSCs comprising culturing fibroblasts or other somatic cells transfecting the fibroblasts or other cells with one or more transcription factors and reducing the activity of one or more epigenetic factors wherein the fibroblasts or other somatic cells are induced to become pluripotent stem cells. In some embodiments the epigenetic factors are associated with histone modification chromatin compaction and access to activators or repressors. The imaging and analytical methods described herein may be used to identify cells that have dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state as well as to follow the progress of dedifferentiation in real time. In certain embodiments of any of the foregoing such imaging and analytical methods are non destructive and non invasive.

Gene expression is regulated by a hierarchy of genetic epigenetic and nuclear mechanisms O Brien et al. 2003 van Driel et al. 2003 . Gene silencing is regulated by nuclear architecture which controls histone modification chromatin compaction and access to activators or repressors Feuerbach et al. 2002 Cai et al. 2003 Teixeira et al. 2002 . Silencing within heterochromatin by histone H3 lysine 9 H3 K9 methylation Grewal et al. 2003 and substitution of histone variants Mizuguchi et al. 2004 is an important mechanism for gene inactivation . H3K9 methylation recruits heterochromatin proteins 1 HP1 and to large scale neighborhoods of inactive chromatin Pal Bhadra et al. 2004 Cheutin et al. 2003 that are condensed and maintained dynamically Cheutin et al. 2003 . Methylation of H3K27 is associated with facilitative heterochromatin. H3K27 trimethylation discriminates genes that are expressed poised for expression or stably repressed and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non coding transcripts facilitating gene annotation. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation mark imprinting control regions Mikkelsen et al. 2007 . Another hypothesis has been developed that H3K27 and H3K4 methylation act in a bivalent manner at conserved noncoding sequences to control expression of coding sequences within pluripotent cells Bernstein et al. 2006 . Chromatin remodeling is controlled not just by histone post translational modification but by chromatin remodeling proteins including Chd1 which regulates open chromatin structures and maintains pluripotency Gaspar Maia et al. 2009 .

DNA methylation of cytosine residues essential for mammalian development is another well studied epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing Bird 2002 . DNA methylation represses genes partly by recruitment of methyl CpG binding domain proteins MBDs which assemble multi protein repressor complexes that affect chromatin architecture thereby rendering genes inactive. MeCP2 is one such protein which complexes with a transcriptional repression domain Sin 3A to silence transcription by recruiting HDAC 1 or 2 which removes acetyl groups from histones resulting in gene silencing Jones et al. 1998 Nan et al. 1998 . HDACs act in concert with HMTs to replace acetyl groups with methyl groups on histone H3k9. In pericentric regions of Egger et al. 2004 mammalian cells the HMT responsible for H3k9 trimethylation is SUV39H1 and loss of this enzyme produces mitotic chromosome loss Rea et al. 2000 . This specific complex and resulting H3k9me3 is responsible for induction of DNA satellite repeat methylation by DNMT3 Lehnertz et al. 2003 . Further immunoprecipitation and pull down experiments demonstrate that DNMT3b not only interacts with the chromatin remodeling enzyme hSNF2H HDAC1 2 HP1 proteins and SUV39H1 but also co localizes with these components of the epigenetic machinery at heterochromatin in HeLa cells Geiman et al. 2004 Silverstein et al. 2005 . Any one or more of the foregoing epigenetic methods may be used to produce pluripotent cells such as to generate iPSCs from somatic cells. Such epigenetic methods may optionally be combined with methods of upregulating transcription factor gene expression such as Oct4 Sox2 etc. Moreover the imaging and analytical methods described herein may be used to identify cells that have dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state as well as to follow the progress of dedifferentiation in real time. In certain embodiments of any of the foregoing such imaging and analytical methods are non destructive and non invasive.

In other embodiments the culture medium of the differentiated cells may facilitate the reprogramming process. For example standard MKOS transformation may be used but culture media may be varied. Environmental conditions have been demonstrated to affect endogenous pluripotency markers in fibroblasts Page et al. 2009 and optimized media that enhances iPSC colony formation can be determined. The invention contemplates the use of this feature in combination with any of the foregoing. The imaging and analytical methods described herein may be used to identify cells that have dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state as well as to follow the progress of dedifferentiation in real time. In certain embodiments of any of the foregoing such imaging and analytical methods are non destructive and non invasive.

Induced pluriopotent stem cells must be distinguished from differentiated cells. In some embodiments specific markers of differentiation may be used to identify differentiated cells. Methods that distinguish between cells in varying differentiation states may take advantage of the different gene expression profiles or epigenetic traits present in the cells. Molecular markers of differentiation may be obtained from any somatic cells. Similarly molecular markers of pluripotent cells may be obtained from embryonic stem cells such as human embryonic stem cells hESCs or induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs .

In somatic cells tissue identity is retained by cellular memory of tissue specific gene expression programs. Cellular memory is accomplished through the differential formation of heterochromatin which produces enduring silencing of gene loci Lunyak et al. 2002 Misteli 2005 O Brien et al. 2003 van Driel et al. 2003 . Tissue phenotype is established by silencing tissue inappropriate gene loci in terminally differentiated cells de Wit and van Steensel 2009 . Developmentally cellular identity should remain plastic to a degree until terminal differentiation.

In some embodiments the disappearance of heterochromatin signals that somatic cells are beginning to de differentiate in a process that mirrors differentiation where heterochromatin first appears as embryonic stem cells ESCs begin to specialize. Heterochromatin aggregates are largely absent from hESCs by several criteria which has implications for cellular memory and mitotic chromosome stability in pluripotent cells.

Chromatin is organized hierarchically from post translational modifications of histones and nucleosome structure Annunziato et al. 1981 Kimura and Cook 2001 to dynamic formation of heterochromatin encompassing multi gene loci Cheutin et al. 2003 and finally higher order positioning of entire chromosomes within nuclei Misteli 2005 O Brien et al. 2003 van Driel et al. 2003 . Localized gene specific epigenetic modifications are complemented by higher order chromatin reorganization of multi gene loci into microscopically detectable heterochromatin aggregates which restrict promoter access to transcriptional activators or repressors by physical hindrance Grewal and Moazed 2003 Hattori et al. 2004 .

Turning to the example of human embryonic stem cells hESCs these cells are epigenetically unique among developmental stages. They are derived from the inner cell mass where relevant promoters are hypomethylated during preimplantation development and are followed by a hypermethylation stage immediately post implantation Li 2002 . Epigenetic modifications include H3 acetylation and methylation at key lysine residues including H3K4 H3K9 and H3K27 Azuara et al. 2006b Jorgensen et al. 2006 Lee et al. 2006 Pan et al. 2007 . Bivalent domains generally methylated on the inhibitory domain H3K27 with inset domains of stimulatory H3K4 di and tri methylation are present at promoters for developmentally relevant transcription factors Azuara et al. 2006a Bernstein et al. 2006 Golebiewska et al. 2009 Ku et al. 2008 Pan et al. 2007 . Genome wide H3K9ac is reduced during differentiation Krejci et al. 2009 . Histone arginine methylation R17 and R26 transcriptional activity and are also required for pluripotency in mouse ESC Wu et al. 2009 . Epigenetic modifications are regulated by deacetylases and methyltransferases. Histone deacetylase 1 and 2 HDAC1 and 2 in nucleosome remodeling NuRD complexes act upon pericentromeric heterochromatin in a stage specific manner and initiate deacetylation followed by methylation of pericentromeric histone H3 Kantor et al. 2003 . DNA methyltransferases DNMT 3a 3b also have selective effects on the initiation of DNA methylation at centromeric 5 methyl Cytosine 5meC Bachman et al. 2001 Gopalakrishnan et al. 2009 versus DNA maintenance methylation DNMT1 Ding and Chaillet 2002 Goyal et al. 2006 . Both are required for proper chromatin separation during mitosis Gopalakrishnan et al. 2009 Kantor et al. 2003 . In general pluripotent cells have high levels of open chromatin including extra genomic regions which are transcriptionally active Efroni et al. 2008 Gaspar Maia et al. 2009 . Thus transcriptional activity and gene regulation in developmentally plastic pluripotent ESCs is fundamentally different from somatic cells and this difference is reflected in chromatin structure. In some embodiments the difference in chromatin structure may be used to differentiate between iPSCs and differentiated cells.

Hypomethylation of DNA and histone during preimplantation development could be expected to influence heterochromatin compaction. Compaction is usually tightly coupled to DNA methylation but can occur independently Gilbert et al. 2007 since condensation is influenced by other epigenetic regulators including H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 Wu et al. 2005 hypo acetylation Gorisch et al. 2005 Popova et al. 2009 and linker histone activity Cheutin et al. 2003 Karymov et al. 2001 . Facultative heterochromatin develops on coding regions of the genome while constitutive heterochromatin develops at non coding and highly repetitive regions such as pericentromeric domains Allis et al. 2007 . Constitutive heterochromatin is more persistent but is still dynamic Lam et al. 2006 enriched in H3K9me3 Peters et al. 2002 and is a foundation for higher order chromatin structure Grigoryev et al. 2004 Maison et al. 2002 Natarajan and Schmid 1971 . Silencing in somatic cells is regulated by the synergy of DNA methylation histone modification and chromatin remodeling Lippman et al. 2003 . For example H3K9 trimethylation occurs within heterochromatin Grewal and Moazed 2003 and is a key histone modification associated with gene silencing Kouzarides 2002 during neural differentiation of hESC Golebiewska et al. 2009 . H3K9me3 increases the binding affinity of heterochromatin binding proteins HP1 to large scale neighborhoods of inactive chromatin that are condensed persistent but dynamically active Cheutin et al. 2003 . Indeed HP1 levels are reduced and distribution is delocalized in hESC especially HP1 Bartova et al. 2008b . Additionally H3K9me3 regulates structural organization of pericentromeric heterochromatin Henikoff et al. 2000 Lehnertz et al. 2003 . Assembly of pericentric heterochromatin Peters et al. 2001 Rea et al. 2000 and histone methylation at centromeres Eot Houllier et al. 2009 Kondo et al. 2008 are both essential for proper chromatid separation during mitosis and for genomic stability.

In somatic cells the nuclear periphery is enriched in silenced chromatin while in hESC cells the nuclear periphery is a mixture of permissive and repressive domains Luo et al. 2009 with fewer centromeres. hESCs have radially organized active genes and histone H3 modification patterns with the most active genes in the center of the nucleus Bartova et al. 2008a Strasak et al. 2009a Wiblin et al. 2005 . Epigenetic mechanisms directly influence large scale genome regulation through nuclear organization since inhibition of histone deacetylases and methyltransferases can affect radial chromosome positioning and chromocenter integrity Harnicarova Horakova et al. . In mESCs hyperdynamic structural chromatin proteins characteristic of pluripotent mESCs become less dynamic upon differentiation as higher order chromatin structure is assembled during early differentiation Meshorer et al. 2006 .

One hindrance to measurement of nuclear organization and chromatin dynamics is the lack of measuring tools for quantifying the degree of chromatin condensation. The amorphous structure of chromatin does not lend itself to length or area measurements but computer vision based texture analysis may be used to quantitatively and statistically demonstrate progressive structural changes in chromatin during stem cell differentiation that correspond to epigenetic changes. Taken together pluripotent specific features of nuclear organization may be used as markers for pluripotentcy. Accordingly the expression of such markers in test cells may be compared to the expression in reference cells or images of reference cells. By using statistical comparison methods to determine how closely the test cells match the reference cells pluripotent stem cells are identified. The methods of the present application accomplish this goal.

In some embodiments cells may be assayed for differentiation state without damaging cells and or removing them from the growth media. Non invasive techniques permit continuous monitoring of cells without contacting the cells so that cells and or colonies do not need to be mechanically separated from other cells or from the well where they are growing. Use of non invasive methods also eliminates the need to remove a sample of cells for further processing such as immunostaining or fixation for microscopy. Often cells must be permeabilized and fixed before their features can be analyzed or cells must be labeled with small molecule dyes and or molecular probes. This means that select cells are sacrificed for analysis and are assumed to be representative of the whole population with which they grew. Thus it may not be possible to monitor the progress of differentiation of a specific cell or colony and one would instead be forced to rely on an approximation based on the cells assayed. Since cells within even a homogeneous population do not always differentiate at the same rate the invasive sampling methods may not be suited for purposes where cells at a precise state of differentiation are needed.

Using non invasive methods described herein the growth differentiation and or reprogramming of cell cultures may be monitored and the differentiation state of the cells may be determined by taking images of the cells and processing image information according to the methods described below. Cells may be sampled from the population for analysis or specific cells and or colonies may be monitored continuously over a period of time. In one exemplary embodiment images may be obtained by phase contrast microscopy of live cells or cell colonies.

In some embodiments one criteria for identifying iPSCs during reprogramming is colony morphology Ellis et al. 2009 . Morphology may be determined non invasively permitting measurement of cells that are not perturbed by fluorescent live cell markers. Here non invasive methods are described for screening large numbers of cells for morphology to identify new pluripotent stem cell colonies. shows vanishingly small colonies of hESC after passage onto feeder fibroblasts. Phase contrast images were taken at 4 and 10 magnification on 1 2 and 3 days after passage. The arrow points to a single colony in each frame. The colony in and contains 15 cells and can be discriminated from fibroblasts by eye. Additional colonies are detected on days 2 and 3 but detection of these colonies under the 15 cell threshold cannot be identified with certainty by eye. In methods described herein detection of pluripotent cell colonies uses texture analysis and matches the visual detection limit of experienced observers . Further there are intermediate states and different kinetics of reprogramming depending on the reprogramming panel of transcription factors that could result in partially reprogrammed cells with morphology that is similar to fully pluripotent iPSCs Nakagawa et al. 2008 . In some embodiments morphological criteria alone may be sufficient for identifying intermediate or incompletely reprogrammed states.

In some embodiments texture of pluripotent cells both iPSCs and hESCs may be detected by wavelet analysis Mangoubi et al. 2007 Sammak et al. 2008 and discriminated against either extracellular matrix in mTeSR media or against feeder fibroblasts in DSR media. Further the pluripotent colony texture may be distinguished from the colony texture of differentiated cells with epithelial morphology as well as fibroblast morphology. Further video microscopy can be used to measure the mitotic index and death rates of stem cell colonies . Thus in some exemplary embodiments an algorithm design is used to measure one or more 1 2 or 3 of growth death and reprogramming morphology during the induction of pluripotency under various conditions. The process may be repeated so that cells are iteratively imaged and processed and the methods may be automated.

Both during and after the process of deriving iPSCs it is important to determine when the cells have fully de differentiated to the appropriate pluripotent state. In some embodiments image analysis methods may be performed on images of cells. The image collection may be non invasive or minimally invasive such that images of the same one or more cells can be analyzed at different time points without injuring the cell or disrupting its growth. Moreover real time imaging of differentiation state may be performed in order to monitor the extent of differentiation in a given population and or assess the effects of an environmental change on deprogramming of the cells. Without destruction of cells or addition of exogenous markers colonies may be continuously evaluated either for kinetics of growth and differentiation and or for quality control before therapeutic treatment.

In some embodiments newly reprogrammed cells are distinguished from parent cells on the basis of their morphology. In addition the nuclear organization and colony organization of each respective cell type may provide a basis for distinguishing between cells. In one exemplary embodiment nuclear enzymes like the histone deacetylases HDACs and DNA methyltransferases DNMTs are manipulated to affect cellular reprogramming as described above.

In some embodiments pluripotent stem cells or stem cell colonies are identified in a non invasive and non destructive fashion using statistical multiresolution texture image analysis. Colonies may be imaged with microscopy techniques known in the art. In some embodiments phase contrast microscopy is used. Using image based algorithms pluripotent colonies can be identified and statistically distinguished from differentiated colonies and their exteriors Mangoubi et al. 2007 Sammak et al. 2008 Desai et al. 2009 Mangoubi et al. 2008 .

Texture is a quantifiable method for measuring amorphous non geometric properties of cell morphology particularly nuclear and cytoplasm size and edges. Different cell biological functions are reflected in cell size and shape and so cell morphology is an integrated measure of stem cells and differentiated cell products. Morphology alone may be insufficient to determine the activity of specific molecules but is often sufficient to determine cellular phenotype based on molecular activity. Statistical multiresolution texture analysis is a non destructive optical method for discriminating and classifying images of both hESC cells and colonies. In the case of colonies no chemical is required.

The texture classification algorithms described herein may be used for various hESC and existing iPSC lines under a diversity of culturing conditions. The results may be validated using molecular markers of pluripotency and differentiation. For example the quality of iPSC derivation methods may be evaluated by non invasive kinetic methods and or the quality of resulting iPSCs may be assessed by quantitative immunostaining of single cells with a pluripotency marker panel and epigenetic marker panel.

In some embodiments unmarked images may be used to detect and identify nascent iPSC colonies in the primary passage when they are first derived from human fibroblasts. Nascent iPSC colonies start as single cells or small clusters of cells from Woltjen et al. 2009 and the detection threshold may be established for these cells. In addition kinetic characteristics of living cells may be compared in order to determine reprogramming intermediates. Finally iPSC quality may be verified at early stages with molecular panels of pluripotency and epigenetic markers. This approach may use in certain embodiments methods of texture analysis of static images and or time lapse images to enable the extraction of kinetic features and help reveal the appearance of new iPSCs. Notably statistical methods may be used for simultaneous smoothing and segmentation Park et al. 2009 of small size heterogeneous textures with subregions of irregular shapes. For example distinct pluripotent morphologies may be identified in colonies that are very small like the colonies produced just after passaging and or morphologies in cells that are dispersed as single cells.

Notably image based algorithms may also be used for images of stained nuclei and may be used to classify chromatin organization in single pluripotent cell nuclei Desai et al. 2009 Mangoubi et al. 2008 . In certain embodiments the algorithm is automated and incorporated into a method for i identifying and separating desired iPSCs from background cells and ii providing quantitative colony features.

Algorithms for texture analysis usually require that regions to be analyzed be sufficiently large to contain rectangular subregions of relatively homogeneous subtextures. However single cell and nascent iPSC colonies usually do not afford such luxuries subregions are small heterogeneous and of irregular shapes. Analysis of such shapes requires an improved algorithm suited to these colonies. Described herein is a new Matrix Edge Onion Peel MEOP algorithm Desai et al. 2009 which addresses three challenges regarding textures attributed to nascent iPSCs 1 small size 2 heterogeneity and 3 irregularly shaped regions. This algorithm may be used to identify pluripotent stem cells and or colonies on the basis of their texture. In some embodiments where textural regions are sufficiently large a texture wavelet analysis algorithm may be used but combined with an MEOP algorithm for textural regions of small size.

The MEOP methodology overcomes the limitation of other texture analysis methods when dealing with heterogeneous textures that exhibit onion layer type textural variation. Here the behavior within a layer is assumed to be homogeneous although there may be variation between layers. The shape of the onion layers is data dependent radial symmetry is not required. An energy functional approach may be used for simultaneous smoothing and segmentation. The approach relies on two features a matrix edge field and adaptive weighting of the measurements relative to the smoothing process model. The matrix edge function adaptively and implicitly modulates the shape size and orientation of smoothing neighborhoods over different regions of the texture. It thus provides directional information on the texture that is not available in the more conventional scalar edge field based approaches. The adaptive measurement weighting varies the weighting between the measurements at each pixel.

In the formulation of Okita et al. 2007 the matrix edge field is a generalization of previous formulations such as those in Mumford et al. 1985 and Ambrosio et al. 1990 where a scalar edge field V X is used. A scalar edge field modulates the size of the circular neighborhood over which local smoothing takes place whereas the more general matrix edge field modulates size shape and orientation with an elliptical local smoothing neighborhood. As such the smoothing is more effective.

In the process of simultaneously smoothing and segmenting a heterogeneous texture two features of the algorithm are its ability to i define local neighborhoods of different shapes and orientation and not just of different size as is the current practice thus providing finely segmented images and ii adapt to spatially varying noise. Because of these features it is possible to segment images with narrow regions with a small number of pixels. illustrates the effect of matrix edge segmentation meaning the use of smoothing neighborhoods that vary in size shape and orientation when compared to just size.

In some embodiments nonparametric methods for segmenting and classifying stem cell nuclei may be used. This approach which enables automatic monitoring of stem cell growth and development is based on combining level set methods multiresolution wavelet analysis and non parametric estimation of the density functions of the wavelet coefficients from the decomposition. Additionally to deal with small size textures where the largest inscribed rectangular window may not contain a sufficient number of pixels for multiresolution analysis we propose an adjustable windowing method that enables the multiresolution analysis of elongated and irregularly shaped nuclei. In some exemplary embodiments the adjustable windowing approach combined with non parametric density models yields better classification for cases where parametric density modeling of wavelet coefficients may not be applicable or may be applicable but less robust.

Multiresolution texture analysis can be an effective methodology for retrieving Do and Vetterli 2002 and classifying textures Mangoubi et al. 2007 and is particularly successful in classifying stem cell colonies where textural properties are a qualitative indication of the degree of pluripotency Mangoubi et al. 2007 . Albeit non invasive traditional colony analysis by a microscopist is expensive subjective and slow requiring the attention of a trained specialist. Alternatively while chemical staining is rapid automatable and consistent it is destructive rendering the stained elements unfit for use in tissue growth or drug testing.

By contrast image based stem cell colony texture analysis is automatable non invasive consistent and preserves the colony for subsequent biomedical use. Furthermore it allows for multiscale qualitative monitoring of stem cell growth at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. At the nuclei resolution level even though staining is required the image based methodology is nevertheless of use in quantitatively classifying stem cell nuclei in an automated consistent and rapid manner Mangoubi et al. 2008 . As with colony analysis such quantitation can be of use in understanding the effect various proteins have on the ability to maintain pluripotency and direct differentiation.

In the above references statistical multiresolution wavelet texture analysis was shown to be effective when combined with a parametric statistical model the generalized Gaussian density GGD used to represent the wavelet coefficients in the detail subbands. Parameteric statistical multiresolution wavelet analysis as previously implemented however has limitations 1 it requires a user to manually select rectangular texturally homogeneous regions of sufficient size to enable texture analysis and 2 it assumes the distribution of coefficients is symmetric unimodal and unbiased which may be untrue for some textures. As described above the Matrix Edge Onion Peel algorithm may be used for small size irregularly shaped nuclei that exhibit onion layer textural variation i.e. texture characteristics that change as a function of the nuclear radius.

In some embodiments an algorithm may be used to automatically segment the nuclei and an adjustable windowing method may be used in order to maximize the number of coefficients available from the multiresolution decomposition of a small irregularly shaped i.e. non rectangular region. These steps enable the automatic analysis of images with multiple stem cell nuclei eliminating the need for a human to manually select windows in order to perform texture analysis. Finally a non parametric statistical analysis may be applied to cases where the parametric GGD model is inapplicable. This step yields superior performance over the parametric model in cases where the latter is not applicable.

Four non Gaussian methods are exemplary of non Gaussian methods that may be used for estimating the statistical dissimilarity and can be applied to classify one or both of time series images of individual cells and phase contrast images of entire hESC colonies.

It was noted early on Mallat 1989 that the empirical probability density function pdf of the coefficients in each of the wavelet detail subbands often resembled the symmetric unimodal generalized Gaussian distribution 

Here x is the random variable detail coefficient and and are the width and shape parameters which define the density.

This statistical correspondence suggests a texture model the set of estimated GGDs characterizing the wavelet detail subbands of a texturally homogeneous region. While this model assumes both statistical independence across subbands and the absence of texturally relevant information in the approximation band it has been validated for several textures and techniques for calculating the and parameters have been developed for use in content based image retrieval by Van de Wouwer et al. 1999 and Do and Vetterli 2002 . The method has been successfully applied to stem cell image classification Mangoubi et al. 2008 Mangoubi et al. 2007 .

In some embodiments the GGD model becomes inapplicable at wider scale subbands. Consider the image in which displays a noticeable increase in mean intensity while moving from left to right. As may be seen in the pdf plot in this gradient couples into the third horizontal subband leading to a wavelet coefficient distribution that is noticeably biased and hence poorly modeled by the GGD which is constrained to be symmetric about the origin. This is accounted for by modeling the coefficient pdf using a Parzen density estimator with Gaussian kernel Thompson and Tapia 1990 effectively transforming the coefficient histogram into a pdf via Gaussian smoothing 

Again x is the random variable detail coefficient while x is the set of N detail coefficients calculated for a particular subband. The width parameter modulates the kernel s effective smoothing radius set equal to a constant fraction of the histogram support in order to normalize across subbands.

As the texture model is the set of estimated pdfs for each subband the dissimilarity measure between models is based on the Kullback Leibler divergence KLD which is defined between two pdfs fand fas 

The KLD is asymmetric but a symmetric version is obtained using KLD 1 2 D 1 2 D 2 1 . This distance is then summed across the detail subbands. When using the Parzen model the KLD may be determined via numerical integration.

Wavelet pyramid analysis decomposes two dimensional signals in square or rectangular regions. In many applications this is acceptable an image may be large enough to file or to crop in order to isolate texturally homogeneous rectangular regions for modeling.

In some embodiments involving small or irregularly shaped objects such as stem cell nuclei however isolating a rectangular region of appropriate size may not be possible. A highly plastic or mobile nucleus might exhibit an irregular shape that deforms considerably over time preventing the identification of any rectangular region for analysis with sufficient size to estimate accurate statistics. Too various matrix extension techniques e.g. periodization symmetrization etc. may introduce statistical artifacts.

In order to extract as many coefficients as possible from each subband of the multiresolution wavelet decomposition of such regions we introduce adjustable windowing Lowry et al. 2010 . To explain the procedure assume the existence of a segmentation mask indicating a region of interest within the image and consider some particular pixel within the mask. If the pixels to the left above and diagonally up and to the left are also within the mask then a 2 2 window whose bottom right corner is that pixel is also within the mask. Now consider that 2 2 window. If the pixels immediately to its left above it and diagonally up and to the left are also within the mask then a 3 3 window terminating at the initial pixel is entirely within the mask. This process may be iteratively continued to determine the maximum window length that may begin at a particular pixel and remain entirely within the mask.

More precisely assume the existence of some segmentation mask M in which the region of interest is marked 1 and the exterior 0. If a filter of length k is applied to the image mask Mindicates the filtered outputs derived from information located entirely within Mand may be computed recursively as 5 Here Mdenotes mask Mright shifted i pixels and down shifted j pixels.

We then apply the stationary wavelet transform SWT Pesquet et al. 1996 which up samples the filter rather than down sampling the output to the image so that the detail subbands are identical to the original image in size. For base filter length n the SWT decomposition window at level d has length 2 1 1 5a Via the recursive process above it is then possible to determine which coefficients belong solely to the region of interest at each level. This process is illustrated in . shows the original image. In it is rotated to place the cell s lightest quadrant in the bottom right so that any asymmetry in the wavelet decomposition will be biased to the right of the origin. shows the coefficients selected at each decomposition level red indicates level 4 orange level 3 yellow level 2 and cyan level 1. PDF and Textural Dissimilarity Estimation

In order to compute the dissimilarity between textural patches a pdf estimator may be selected to apply to each of the 3n detail subbands and then quantify dissimilarity using the information divergence i.e. Kullback Leibler divergence or KLD . While other divergence measures exist such as the L1 divergence f f and Bhattacharyya distance the information divergence is especially convenient as it admits tractable closed form solutions for two of our pdf models. For two pdfs f and g the information divergence is defined 

A variety of different methods may be used to estimate the pdf of the wavelet coefficients and their corresponding KLDs four exemplary methods are provided below. In practice model selection involves trade offs between computational simplicity parametric models such as the GGD and S S and accuracy more detailed non parametric models such as A L and L Q .

It was noted early on Mallat 1989 that the pdf of the detail coefficients often resembled the symmetric unimodal generalized Gaussian distribution GGD 

The GGD may be used to model a wide variety of symmetric unimodal density functions. Indeed special cases include the Gaussian square root over 2 2 Laplacian square root over 2 1 and uniform densities for standard deviation . The standard deviation of a GGD process is 

Another density family used for texture classification is the symmetric a stable densities S S used to model distributions with heavier tail probability than allowed by the GGD. While multiple parameterizations exist for the characteristic function of the S S we follow type 2 from Tzagkarakis et al 2004 exp 11 Here is frequency and and are respectively the characteristic exponent 00 . Like the GGD we assume the location parameter is zero. Unlike the GGD the pdf of the S S only exists in closed form for a few special cases including the Cauchy 1 scale and Gaussian 2 square root over 2 distributions.

We therefore follow the method of Tzagkarakis et al. 2004 who applied this density to texture analysis by noting that the normalized characteristic function forms a valid pdf 

The above pdf families both assume that the distribution is symmetric with process mean at the origin. These assumptions are generally reasonable especially as we normalize the image according to mean in pre processing and the detail coefficients are the output of high pass filters. In some cases such as the hESC nucleus shown in a pronounced increase in intensity may be seen as one traverses the cell. This gradient couples into the wider scale detail subbands leading to coefficient distributions which are noticeably asymmetric and biased 2b and are thus poorly modeled via either GGD or S S distributions.

In some embodiments it may be desirable to use a KLD estimator which makes no assumptions as to the shape of the underlying distribution. One exemplary embodiment is based on the Ahmad Lin A L entropy estimator Ahmad et al. 1976 

Here X and Y are the two sets of detail coefficients and X denotes the number of elements in the set X. K x indicates some kernel function. By way of example we have used a Parzen Gaussian kernel with bandwidth Boltz et al. 2007 0.9 min circumflex over circumflex over 1.34 15 

Here is the set of data under estimation either X or Y circumflex over is the empirical standard distribution and circumflex over p is the interquartile range.

In comparison to the GGD and S S distribution non parametric methods have the significant advantage of generality they make no assumption about the underlying shape of the distribution. However such estimates are generally expensive to compute and require storing or recomputing the entire decomposition. Consequently this estimator is most usefully applied in situations in which the empirical coefficient distribution exhibits significant asymmetry or multi modality.

Kernel based methods like the Ahmad Lin estimator are famously sensitive to the bandwidth . In an attempt to circumvent this Boltz et al. 2007 have combined the Ahmad Lin entropy estimator with the Loftsgaarden Quesenberry L Q pdf estimator Loftsgaarden et al. 1965 

The dimension is d which equals one in the univariate case and Y x is the distance from x to the knearest element in the set Y excluding any elements located at x. The neighborhood size k must be chosen a priori a common choice is k square root over X . Boltz et al. 2007 claim that in general the KLD estimate is less sensitive to the choice of k than to .

Using the KLD dissimilarity measure hESC textural patches may then be classified using any convenient classification or clustering algorithm according to methods known in the art. Exemplary classification methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 711 174 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 321 360 the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. For example the k Nearest Neighbor kNN algorithm may be applied or a Support Vector Machine SVM may be applied Mangoubi et al. 2007 .

In some embodiments a combination of techniques described herein may be used. For example any method known in the art for inducing pluripotent stem cells may be used in combination with the Matrix Edge Onion Peel algorithm and or the adaptive windowing method for analyzing images of the cells. Likewise pluripotent stem cells may be derived according to the epigenetic methods described and other statistical methods for analyzing cell images may be used. According to the methods any cells may be used as a starting point for deriving iPSCs including but not limited to fibroblasts and other somatic cells. Moreover iPSCs may be generated from cells of virtually any organism such as mouse rat pig non human primate and human.

In addition some embodiments provide a method for deriving induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells and identifying the iPSCs comprising culturing fibroblasts transfecting the fibroblasts with one or more transcription factors and reducing activity of one or more epigenetic regulators wherein the fibroblasts are induced to become pluripotent stem cells. is a flow chart of a method for identifying induced pluripotent stem cells. The method includes obtaining an image of one or more cells step representing the image as a multiplicity of pixels step using a processor to extract one or more image features from the multiplicity of pixels step comparing the one or more image features with image features derived from one or more pluripotent stem cells step wherein the processor applies one or more statistical comparison methods to compare the image features and whereby iPSCs are derived and identified. Having generally described the invention Applicants refer to the following illustrative examples to help to understand the generally described invention. These specific examples are included merely to illustrate certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention and they are not intended to limit the invention in any respect. Certain general principles described in the examples however may be generally applicable to other aspects or embodiments of the invention. The invention contemplates that any one or more of the aspects embodiments and other features described above and below can be combined

To validate non invasive measures of reprogramming an immunostaining approach is used for a panel of nuclear and cytoplasmic factors characteristic of pluripotency including Oct4 Nanog Sox2 FGF5R HNF3b Fox D 3 and Rex1. Markers of later differentiation stages also differ in pluripotent cells including Gata 6 Bracyury and AFP not shown . Additional markers useful for discriminating early pre and post implantation pluripotent lineages have been identified for mouse ESCs Tesar et al. 2007 . Preliminary studies have found these markers in pluripotent hESCs but not in neuronally differentiated cells. However the karyotypically normal hESC line H7 grown in different media all have positive immunostaining but quantitation with automated microscopy reveals very different profiles. The pluripotency panel of H7s on mouse embryo fibroblast feeders in DSR DMEM with knockout Serum Replacer media are much lower than in H7 s grown in the feeder free media StemPro Invitrogen . Preliminary evaluation of the markers Rex1 and FGF5R suggest that feeders may promote pluripotent epiblast like cells or primitive endoderm like cells Rathjen et al. 1999 Pelton et al. 2002 which have high FGF5R levels and low Rex1 levels rather than inner cell mass like cells with high Rex1 levels and low FGF5R levels Tesar et al. 2007 Pelton et al. 2002 Chambers et al. 2009 . Rex1 in particular develops over time between day 1 and day 5 in StemPro culture . Optimized feeder free culture media may promote reprogramming. This example indicates among other things that analysis of stem cell structure and gene expression using quantitative and automated approaches reveals distinctions not otherwise observable or ascertainable.

Different markers of heterochromatin H3K9me3 in green and H3K27me3 in red A C have different distributions in pluripotent cells but are more colocalized yellow in neurally differentiated cells and in somatic cells. Conversely markers of euchromatin H3K9ac in green H3K4me2 in red are more colocalized in pluripotent cells. Euchromatin and heterochromatin markers are spatially distinct at all stages.

Pluiripotent stem cells show different organization of histone posttranslational markers than differentiated cells. Different markers of heterochromatin H3K9me3 in green and H3K27me3 in red have different distributions in pluripotent cells but are more colocalized yellow in neurally differentiated cells and in somatic cells. Conversely markers of euchromatin H3K9ac in green H3K4me2 in red are more colocalized in pluripotent cells. Euchromatin and heterochromatin markers are spatially distinct at all stages.

The epigenetic state of pluripotent cells varies with environmental conditions and lineage stage. Histone methylation differs in ICM like and epiblast like hESC states. Epiblast like hESC on feeders and gelatin DSR media have lower levels of Oct4 and H3K9 acetylation and higher H3K9 methylation levels than ICM like hESC in feeder free conditions in mTeSR on matrigel while feeder conditioned media shows highest levels of H3K9 methylation. IPSCs cultured in StemPro have similar epigenetic histone states compared to hESCs. Histone H3K9ac and H3K9me and the fraction of cells in S phase are similar in iPSCs while extraction of H2B after detergent lysis without added salt is similar to hESCs not shown but more extractable than differentiated cells showing that histones binding is labile in both pluripotent cells. The epigenetic state of iPSCs during reprogramming will be characterized thus adding to the criteria for distinguishing intermediate reprogramming states.

Pluripotent cells express several epigenetic enzymes including DNMT 1 3a 3b and HDAC 1 and 2 . In some cases despite high enzyme levels enzyme activity is low in pluripotent cells which reflects by low methylation of DNA or deacetylation of histone H2BK5 . The exception are those cells at the colony periphery that have initiated differentiation. Notably HDAC levels do not change during differentiation on feeders.

HDAC 1 and 2 levels in hESCs were modified with tet inducible lentivirus for HDAC1 2 knockdown and a nonsilencing control . Several lines of stably transformed hESC have been established and initial testing of the effects of knockdown show an inhibition in the rate of differentiation in doxycyclin induced HDAC 1 2 knockdown lines when challenged to differentiate with BMP4 . HDAC KD fibroblasts will also be established and the effects on reprogramming efficiency will be determined.

Human fibroblasts line IRM90 ATCC CCL186 are used to derive iPSCs Yu et al. 2007 Yu et al. 2008 . Ectopic expression of the 4 transcription factors c Myc Klf4 Oct 4 and Sox2 MKOS is induced in these cells with the PiggyBac vector PB MKOS system Woltjen et al. 2009 Kaji et al. 2009 . Advantages of this system include transposase excision of the inserted DNA after induction of pluripotency to prevent further activity by the ectopic genes. In addition this non viral system has high transformation efficiency and uses a single cassette for multicistronic expression of the 4 reprogramming transgenes separated by 3 different 2A peptide sequences Hasegawa et al. 2007 . Optimized coexpression of MKOS transcription factors from a single insert minimizes the frequency of expression of an incomplete set of MKOS transcription factors which produces incomplete reprogramming. This expression cassette is induced by coexpression of a constitutively active CAG rtTA transactivator construct and addition of doxycyclin to the media Woltjen et al. 2009 Kaji et al. 2009 . Commercial lentivirus constructs for tet inducible MKOS transgenes are also available StemGent . Lentiviral transformation of hESCs and selection of stable transformed cell lines using puromycin is performed.

The transformation of human fibroblasts is performed in combination with shRNA mediated knockdown of epigenetic regulators. Fibroblasts from line IRM90 are transformed with a doxycyclin inducible lentivirus knockdown KD shRNA for HDAC1 or 2 and DNMT1 3a or 3b and a non silencing sequence. After HDAC or DNMT KD IRM90 lines are established the cells are transformed with MKOS transcription factors. Colony transformation is compared in the presence of doxycyclin which initiates epigentic changes or under control conditions in the absence of doxycyclin. Transformation efficiency fraction of morphologically transformed colonies feeder cell number reprogramming efficiency fraction of colonies with pluripotency markers and rate of efficiency efficiency time are determined using two methods i by counts of colonies detected by morphology using nuclear density and ii by cytoskeletal reorganization with Hoechst staining nuclear density in morphologically transformed colonies and Alexa 546 phalloidin staining absence of fibroblasts stress fibers appearance of peripheral actin bands in stem cells data not shown and SSEA4 reprogramming . These validation counts are correlated with colony counts determined by the methods described above. Finally statistically significant differences among conditions are determined in order to evaluate e the efficacy of epigenetic priming before reprogramming.

One lentivirus Open Biosystems includes the tet inducible shRNA pTRIPZ construct with red fluorescent protein and puromycin selection markers. Tet inducible expression systems have been established in HEK293 cells not shown and hESCs. Selection of stable hESCs is established by puromycin selection . The efficacy of HDAC1 KD is demonstrated in . With nucleofection of a HDAC1 shRNA in a retroviral plasmid the transfection efficiency was 80 of cells and the KD efficacy was 30 fold similar to the inhibition of HDAC1 by the inhibitor trichostatin A TSA .

Fibroblasts are transformed with MKOS transcription factors in different media for supporting pluripotency. Four exemplary media iPSC reprogramming that support pluripotency include 

One standard protocol is to grow iPSCs on feeders and DSR but StemPro and mTeSR are favorable for hESC and iPSC growth rates high levels of pluripotency markers and low levels of histone methylation. All of these conditions should favor reprogramming. A basal media EMPM promotes survival of hESC for 1 2 weeks in the absence of growth factors except insulin. This media is evaluated with and without single growth factors FGF2 Activin A Neruegulin and with matrigel instead of gelatin. When added to fibroblasts FGF2 alone increased expression of endogenous pluripotency markers Page et al. 2009 .

For live cell experiments live cell time lapse series are recorded in non invasive phase contrast and at least initially with fluorescence to confirm rtTA IRES GFP expression for reprogramming factor activation. Various magnifications are evaluated with 10 magnification likely the minimum for detecting colonies of 10 cells or less . The time lapse interval is varied depending on whether colony counting is desired once per day or whether single cell growth and death rates as a function of reprogramming is needed.

Incomplete reprogramming of fibroblasts after MKOS transformation is possible producing false iPSCs. Therefore morphological determination of iPSC formation gray screens are confirmed by measuring molecular markers of pluripotency green screens . First phase contrast images grey screens are analyzed by texture analysis and separate fluorescence images are acquired from the same colonies using extracellular markers of pluripotency such as SSEA4. Staining with antibodies to SSEA4 is more uniform in H7 s than TRA1 60 TRA 1 81 or SSEA3. To confirm that cells are pluripotent in nascent iPSC colonies four color immunostaining is performed and automatically quantitated using the Thermo Fisher Arrayscan. Quantitative measurements of nascent iPSC and fibroblasts can be distinguished from fibroblasts by internuclear distance Sammak et al. 2008 . Validation of live cell experiments with fixed cell indicators is necessary because expression of single pluripotency transcription factors alone is not sufficient for characterizing the pluripotent state . For each experimental condition cells are fixed at various times after induction and immunostained with panels of antibodies to markers of pluripotency and epigenetic states. Markers of pluripotency are indicated in Table 1 and markers of global epigentic state are listed in Table 2.

Colonies of hESCs were characterized at three distinct developmental stages pluripotent pluri multipotent neurectoderm early diff and neural rosettes late diff restricted to neural lineages Ozolek et al. 2009 Ozolek et al. 2007 . Neuronal differentiation was initiated on low density MEFs 5 000 cm Ozolek et al. 2009 Ozolek et al. 2007 . Pluripotency was determined by immunostaining for transcription factors Oct4 Hhf3b FoxD3 and Nanog and absence of the differentiation markers Nestin Cdx2 Gata6 AFP and brachyury not shown . Nestin a neurectoderm marker was present infrequently in pluripotent H7 but was upregulated in early differentiated neurectoderm especially at colony edges. Early differentiated cells grew in epitheliod monolayers characterized by larger nuclear diameter and greater internuclear distance and . Markers for committed neural lineages including GFAP O4 NCAM or beta 3 tubulin were present only at background levels in neurectodermal cells not shown . Neurectoderm was multipotent and could form oligodendrocytes radial glia and to a lesser degree astrocytes Ozolek et al. 2009 Ozolek et al. 2007 . Late differentiated colonies were produced from higher density colonies after 2 4 weeks and were enriched in neural rosettes characteristic of functionally polarized neural tube epithelium Bacallao et al. 1989 . In contrast to early differentiated neurectoderm late differentiated neural rosettes were present within multilayer regions and were NCAM positive .

The in vitro rosettes had several characteristics of organized 3 dimensional tissue. Electron microscopy of the rosette core revealed a fluid filled clear zone containing villi characteristic of secretory cells . The plasma membranes of apical cells were in tight apposition with an osmiophillic mordant in intercellular spaces box in f . Bundles of intermediate filaments and microtubules radiate from the core and a polarized distribution of centrioles could be found at the apex of several cells near the lumen characteristic of a secretory epithelium. Thus the in vitro cell culture system provided a functioning developmental model for evaluating heterochromatin assembly at three distinct developmental stages 1 pluripotent pluri 2 multipotent early diff and 3 in committed neural lineages late diff .

The morphological transformation of heterochromatin was evaluated at these three distinct developmental stages by light and electron microscopy. Chromatin condensation during differentiation was validated by electron microscopy by an increase in osmiophillic staining compare enlargements of the area outlined in white in . With transmission electron microscopy osmiophillic staining progressed from extremely fine grain uniform structure that was below the level of detection by light microscopy in pluripotent hESCs to fine grained aggregates in early differentiated cells that were just separated by the limit of resolution by light microscopy 0.2 m to coarse grained aggregates in late differentiated hESCs . DNA density can be measured with fluorescent dyes which indicate heterochromatin and euchromatin domains Grigoryev et al. 2006 Mateos Langerak et al. 2007 . Pluripotent cells did not have morphologically distinct euchromatin and heterochromatin but instead chromatin density varied slowly across the nucleus low spatial frequencies in pluripotent cells exhibited high frequency small amplitude variations in early differentiated cells and medium frequency large amplitude variations in late differentiated cells . Heterochromatin condenses via an intermediate stage characterized by small aggregates that condense into larger domains a physical process called accretion.

Heterochromatin accretion was further quantified with wavelet analysis to measure the density variations at multiple spatial scales Lowry et al. 2010 Mangoubi et al. 2008 Mangoubi et al. 2007 Sammak et al. 2008 . Nuclei at three stages have different chromatin textures enlargements in . Ten nuclei from each stage were quantitatively compared . The color chart shows the statistical separation of all images as determined by the Kullback Leibler KL distance Do and Vetterli 2002 . Overall the self comparison within each group was similar blue . The cross comparisons between different developmental stages were dissimilar red . We note that for normalized Gaussian densities where the standard deviation is 1 a KL distance of 7 or higher is equivalent to at least 7 standard deviations of separation between the means of 2 density functions leading to more than 0.99 confidence level. The intermediate nascent aggregates of chromatin were texturally separated KL distance of 20 from both pluripotent cell chromatin and differentiated cell heterochromatin. The main point is that with the KL distance as an statistical image feature clustering of nuclei into the right class is automatable pluripotent differentiated or early differentiated. Thus computer vision methods specifically statistical multiresolution texture analysis Lowry et al. 2010 Mangoubi et al. 2008 Mangoubi et al. 2007 Sammak et al. 2008 provides a novel quantitative measurement of chromatin condensation and statistically distinguishes a new intermediate phase of chromatin accretion that occurs during initiation of differentiation.

In pluripotent cells pericentromeres were not all the same for H3Kme3 levels . In HSF6 interphase and prometaphase cells less than half of the centromeres green human CREST serum contained H3K9me3 red spots while in early differentiated cells most pericentromeres contained H3K9me3 cf. enlargements in . The area of H3K9me3 increased 4 fold 150 21 mto 676 20 m upon hESC differentiation and as expected the area of CREST spots was constant n 45 1 centromeres cell n 10 pluripotent cells as evaluated from confocal series . H3K9me3 localization at pericentromeres was measured by Mander s correlation coefficients which shows that the fraction of pericentromeres that contained H3K9me3 increased from 44 12 in pluripotent cells to 80 1 n 20 nuclei in early differentiated cells. Conversely most H3K9me3 was pericentromeric in pluripotent hESCs while extra pericentromeric H3K9me3 increased during differentiation . Similar results were seen in H7 cells not shown . H3K9me3 levels in H7 cells measured by immunoblot increased 4 fold for human and 10 fold for mouse ESC 0.1 0.1 to 0.4 0.14 P

The nuclear distribution of H3K9ac in pluripotent hESCs was diffuse during interphase except for nucleoli . While H3K9ac is more granular upon early differentiation the levels of immunostaining in HSF6 cells were not significantly different not shown . Measurement of normalized immunoblot band density in H7 cells averaged over 4 independent biological samples confirms that the difference in H3K9ac was not significant. However a decrease in H3K9ac in mouse ESC during differentiation was observed and significant under identical conditions. Thus in human hESCs we observed progressive histone H3K9me3 on pericentromeres independent of gross changes in global levels of H3K9ac. H3K9ac levels have been reported to decrease upon hESC differentiation Krejci et al. 2009 and indeed we also see significant H3K9ac decreases with neural differentiation that produce neural and oligodendrocyte precursors manuscript in preparation . However in the case of neurectoderm produced by 7 day culture on low density feeders developmental markers such as Oct4 and Nestin and epigenetic markers such as 5MeC and pericentromere specific H3K9me3 occur in the absence of significant changes in H3K9 acetylation.

Maximum projection confocal sections of HSF6 hESCs immunostained for methylated histone H3K9me3 red and DNA 5meC green showed that 5meC increased in early differentiated cells at colony edges right . In late differentiated cells H3K9me3 coalesced with 5MeC . Measurement of histone and DNA correlation is shown in . Single confocal slices with constant linear contrast are shown in the enlargements of single interphase c e and mitotic f h cells. Colocalized domains above a constant threshold are shown in white. In interphase nuclei trimethylated H3K9 appeared in small low intensity spots that coalesce into larger brighter spots upon late differentiation . In mitotic cells centromeric H3K9me3 appeared without significant 5meC in pluripotent cells while 5meC first appeared at highest levels at distal chromosome arms in early differentiated hESCs unlike the mostly pericentromeric distribution of H3K9me3 . 5meC immunostaining extended the full chromosome length in late differentiated cells .

Cytofluorograms were prepared from single confocal sections of the colonies and revealed a progressive increase in the correlation of methylated histone and DNA upon differentiation. In pluripotent cells most 5meC staining was not distinguishable from noise low values on y axis . In early differentiated cells x and y values of the intensity distribution fall about the median red line but the breadth of the distribution was wide showing partial colocalization. In late differentiated cells the x and y intensities tightly followed the median showing high colocalization and 1 1 stoichiometry. The stoichiometric value depends on antigen density and fluorescence exposure time and so are not absolute. The average Pearson s correlation coefficient for 4 independent colonies shows that the correlation of methylated DNA with methylated histones increases 8.4 fold p

In hESC line H7 DNMT1 3a and 3b and respectively were present in pluripotent hESCs but were reduced in Oct4 negative early differentiated hESCs bottom right of each panel in . DNMT3a and 3b enzymes responsible for de novo DNA methylation varied proportionally to Oct4 intensity from cell to cell and became undetectable in Oct4 negative cells decreasing 15 fold and 32 fold respectively significant at P

HDACs were present in both pluripotent and early differentiated hESCs and h j . HDAC levels measured by western blot revealed that HDAC1 and 2 levels were not statistically different during differentiation in either mouse or human ESCs. The ratio of the staining intensity of HDAC 1 and 2 varied in pluripotent cell nuclei but was spatially constant in early differentiated hESCs see enlargements adjusted for equal red and green luminance . Cytofluorograms similarly show a broad intensity distribution low correlation in pluripotent cells compared to a tighter distribution in early differentiated cells . H2BK5 a selective substrate for HDAC1 Barski et al. 2007 was acetylated in pluripotent cells 27 lower in early differentiated cells p

Pluripotent hESCs line H7 show diffuse HP1 while early differentiated cells showed an increasingly focal distribution of HP1 and HP1 respectively . The same pattern was observed upon mouse ECS differentiation not shown . Because of their diffuse distribution in pluripotent cells HP1 and HP1 overlapped nonspecifically with H3K9me3 . But in early differentiated cells HP1 codistributed with H3Kme3 focal spots white while the small focal spots of HP1 showed less colocalization with H3K9me3 positive chromocenters . The co distribution of HP1 was measured by cytofluorograms and by Pearson s and Van Steensel s correlation coefficients that quantified the colocalization of H3K9me3 with HP but not with HP1 in early differentiated cells. Similar changes were seen in mouse ESCs not shown . Protein levels of HP1 remained unchanged in human ESCs but increased in mouse ESCs emphasizing species specific heterochromatin assembly mechanisms. HP1 which is preferentially associated with chromocenters was not detected . In pluripotent mitotic cells HP1 was excluded from chromosomes and was restricted to the cytoplasm . In contrast in early differentiated mitotic cells HP1 bound chromosomes and was absent from the cytoplasm . HP was extractable by detergent lysis of pluripotent but not differentiated hESC . The increased colocalization and binding of HP1 for chromatin further supports the hypothesis of heterochromatin assembly upon early differentiation of hESC.

New heterogeneous texture algorithms are applied to images of nascent colonies obtained from the epigenetic based processes and statistical information is extracted from the algorithm s output.

To compare the development of different iPSC procedures time lapse analysis of textural transformation is used. is one example of such analysis applied to chromatin texture transformation during differentiation. Statistically distinguishing between two iPSC generation protocols is possible using robust hypothesis testing which helps to establish that a method such as the epigenetics based process produces more colonies of better quality when compared to the conventional protocol. The numerical performance of the algorithm is evaluated Mangoubi et al. 2008 to algorithms now used specifically to classify stem cell nuclei.

Given that the fluorescent marker concentrates within the nucleus cell nuclei comparatively bright foreground objects could be isolated from the surrounding growth medium comparatively dark background region using a Chan Vese style level set algorithm Chan and Vese 2001 . Region growing was then used both to label foreground objects and fill any small holes located within these objects. As debris and noise occasionally create small spurious objects labeled regions with size below an appropriate threshold were removed. The result is that each nucleus is associated with a binary mask M denoting its area within the image. Thus if pixel i j is within the nucleus M i j 1 and M i j 0 otherwise.

Following segmentation the images is normalized to account for nuclear orientation in the focal plane by first rotating the image so that its widest span is aligned with the horizontal. Subsequently the image is rotated or reflected to place its brightest quadrant to the bottom right. This transformation insures that the overall image intensity gradient runs from left to right and top to bottom which in turn insures that any bias in the wavelet coefficients in the wider scale detail subbands will be in the positive direction. This will provide consistency when comparing the textures of nuclei. This process is illustrated in 

The hESC textures were classified according to a three stage wavelet based statistical method developed for Content Based Image Retrieval CBIR Do et al. 2002 . See . Note that this method is suitable for texture analysis comparing two patches but lacks features necessary for texture synthesis artificially generating patches .

In the first stage wavelet decomposition was applied to the grayscale of a texturally homogeneous image patch. As wavelet analysis decomposes a signal locally according to orientation and scale it is especially apt for modeling texture characterized by intensity randomness at multiple scales. More specifically an n level decomposition yields three detail subbands per level one oriented horizontally one vertically and one diagonally. The absence of textural information was assumed in the approximation subband.

In the second stage a dissimilarity measure between textural patches was derived from a statistical model of the empirical probability density function pdf of the coefficients in the 3n detail subbands which are assumed to be statistically independent. In the third stage the dissimilarity measure is used to classify or cluster texture patches.

These features may also be used as part of an ensemble of features into a nonlinear classifier. Previous examples include border crispness using a support machine Jeffreys 2004 Mangoubi et al. 2008 Mangoubi et al. 2007 and color nuclear shape and orientation etc. using neural networks Bhagavatula et al. 2010 . For images of sufficient resolution the methodology above is simpler and yields satisfactory performance.

Human ESC colonies were maintained in the pluripotent state as confirmed by immunostaining for molecular markers of pluripotency OCT4 . Differentiated cells were produced by treatment with the growth factor bone morphogenic protein BMP4 to form trophectoderm as confirmed by immunostaining CDX2 . These two validated developmental stages of stem cells were used to develop a textural approach to colony morphology.

Stem cell colonies change morphology during differentiation primarily due to a 40 increase in nuclear and cells diameter but also because of an increase in heterogeneity of cell size since the standard deviation is 80 and 50 larger for differentiated cells and nuclei respectively . Compare the colonies in and and . Pluripotent colonies exhibit a fine grained homogeneous texture within a crisp clearly defined border around each cell. The well defined cells are of uniform size some with white borders a phase halo artifact due to a lens effect of domed cells . In contrast differentiated colonies exhibit less well defined borders dark centers and irregular broad pale cell edges no white lines described as a fried egg appearance of individual cells in a continuous monolayer. While horizontal line scans of image grayscale show that both images exhibit considerable intensity variation over distance the two may be distinguished according to the scale at which random fluctuation occurs grayscale intensity in the fine grained pluripotent colony fluctuates at a comparatively higher spatial frequency. The intensity profile depends not only on cell and nuclear diameter x and y dimensions but also on whether cell edges are abrupt or graded physical profile in the z dimension 

This spatial frequency contains composite information regarding the edges in an image and is an integrated measure of the size number and shape of the cells in the image. Small compact cells have more sharp edges than large cells with gradually graded cell cell borders. Stem cell image texture is classified by quantifying scale dependent statistical variation using multiresolution wavelet analysis which decomposes a signal locally according to position and scale . In and and the coefficients in the second and third detail subbands which account for variation at scales of 2and 2pixels respectively of the pluripotent colony have a probability density function with a noticeably wider center and thicker tails indicating more numerous edges at small scale and hence more and smaller cells. Likewise in the situation is reversed at the sixth detail subband scale 2pixels indicating that the differentiated image contains more widely spaced edges and hence larger cells. The scale which is most sensitive to stem cell differentiation is similar to the average diameter of pluripotent and differentiated stem cells 69 30 pixels and 82 40 pixels respectively . To be fully general for a colony image we generalize to two dimensions.

These methods were first applied to the fixed nuclei described in Section 2b.ii examples of which are shown in pluripotent and early differentiated . After determining the initial segmentation mask via Chan Vese level set methods Chan et al. 2001 and CellProfiler Carpenter et al. 2006 adaptive windowing was employed. The statistical multiresolution texture model was applied using a variety of wavelet types and each of the four KLD estimation methods.

A k nearest neighbor classifier was applied to the fifty three cells as illustrated in where a white square has been placed along the x axis to indicate the ten least dissimilar nuclei to a given cell. Thus blocks along the diagonal indicate correct cell classification while off diagonal marks indicate low dissimilarity between a given cell and another class. With only two exceptions the majority of each cells neighbors are from the correct class. The clustering is therefore nearly perfect. These results are consistent with other results and methods on different data sets Mangoubi et al. 2008 Desai et al. 2009 Lowry et al. 2010 indicating that texture analysis can play the role of a non destructive biomarker that can complement other biomarkers.

Results in for error rates due to varying wavelets and decomposition levels indicate that for these images accuracy is highly robust to both the choice of wavelet and the number of decomposition levels. In cases in which cells images exhibit noticeable fine scale variation however it might be critical to extract as many decomposition levels and thus variation in scale as possible. As for pdf modeling the GGD density function for modeling the coefficients of the decomposition proved preferable. Save for a few exceptions with L Q the accuracy of the four methods is comparable and the GOD is easiest to compute. Notably the method presented automates the cell analysis and classification since segmentation preceded nuclei texture analysis.

Since colony images might contain a mixture of pluripotent cells differentiated cells extracellular matrix proteins and feeders image segmentation must be combined with texture characterization. The hierarchical classification approach described herein fuses texture based classification methods with window based decision making to segment and classify inhomogeneous colony images. The ability to quantify partially differentiated colonies or mixed cultures is a significant advance that enables us to measure the dynamic process of stem cell development.

The classification method was also used to classify iPSCs. The segmentation mask was derived using the tiling method. Coefficients were selected using the adaptive windowing method and the statistic texture model was GGD db4 wavelet 5 decomposition levels swt. Adaptive windowing was used here and in addition to dealing with small colonies it has the advantage of assembling features from the entire colony into one feature vector. Traditional method requires tiling which is not possible with small colonies.

In iPSCs colonies 1 6 in a f can be distinguished from differentiated colonies 7 8 shown in g and h . Colony 3 b appears to be an outlier possibly because it comes in two disconnected sections but this cell is still clearly an iPSC and not a differentiated cell. Colony 9 i is a small fragment of iPSC colony 4 d . Adaptive windowing helps to maximize the coefficients which can be used to derive the texture model. Here colony 9 i is clearly an iPSC rather than a differentiated cell.

The comparison is based on a non Gaussian multiresolution wavelet texture analysis using adaptive windowing. Specifically a wavelet decomposition is taken of each colony and the wavelet coefficients for each subband are used to estimate a non Gaussian probability density function. The joint probability density function across all subbands characterizes the colony or colony class. For a pair of colonies we compare the two probability density functions of the pair using the Kullback Leibler KL divergence or the likelihood ratio or any other comparisons. The results shown are for the KL divergence k . The matrices show a comparison of pairs of colonies each based on two different wavelet decompositions. The KL divergence value for a pair of colonies is indicated by its color. The closer to dark blue the color of a square is the more similar the two colonies are. Thus diagonal elements where each colony is compared to itself are dark blue because the KL divergence is zero. We see that squares comparing any pair in colonies 1 to 6 are bluish meaning the colonies are texturally similar. Likewise colonies 5 and 6 have small KL divergneces. By contrast a comparison of any of the colonies 1 to 6 ipscs to colonies 7 and 8 differentiated shows larger divergence as indicated by the reddish color of the corresponding square. Panel j shows a coefficient level mask for colony 9. Here the number 1 corresponds to outside the colony while 0 corresponds to inside the colony and not included in any subband estimation. Numbers 1 5 are coefficients used to estimated the subband.

The challenge in colony image classification is to distinguish the fine grained pluripotent regions from the differentiated swampland and both from the exterior. This was accomplished by subdividing images into non overlapping windows of constant size each of which is classified independently using the GGD density function to model the statistical variation of the wavelet coefficients. As intra class textural heterogeneity means that not all differentiated pluripotent or exterior windows exactly resemble one another windows were classified not by reference models but by comparison against expert classified samples in a model library compiled from four images three pluripotent one differentiated illustrated in . The intra library KLD shows the grouping of library textures into classes one differentiated three exterior and two pluripotent from top left to bottom right shown as bluish blocks clustered along the diagonal of the matrix of KLD between pairs of colonies in the library. Note the resemblance between the first differentiated and last pluripotent classes shown in the greenish bar off diagonal and the textural heterogeneity of the differentiated class with its lighter shade of blue.

Window class assignment uses a k nearest neighbor classifier. After computing the dissimilarity between the unknown window to each library model the k models with the smallest dissimilarity i.e. nearest neighbors vote and the class with the most votes wins. To reject ambiguous cases models are only allowed to vote if their dissimilarity is below some ceiling value and the end result is only accepted if at least k k votes concur. In practice classification is shown to be robust to the choice of k k and the dissimilarity ceiling.

For ease and speed of computation windows are chosen to be fairly large 256 256 pixels and thus several windows contain heterogeneous mixtures of textural classes e.g. pluripotent and exterior. Such windows represent the superposition of two or more pdfs. To address this issue we refine classification via hierarchical image windowing. After the classifier identifies these windows using spatial reasoning rules we quarter them and re classify in the same manner as above. This process may be re iterated until characteristic features e.g. differentiated cellular clumps pluripotent white lines etc. are on the order of the window size. Minimum scale in our application is thus 64 64 pixels.

Two spatial reasoning rules identify textural border windows for refined classification. First select windows failing the k nearest neighbor test. Second select any differentiated window that borders upon a window of another class since differentiated hESC regions are characterized by a type of textural inhomogeneity border windows are prone to being misidentified as differentiated.

Classification of inhomogeneous hESC colony images is quite successful. Typically identification of pluripotent windows is near perfect 99 90 confidence interval CI 0.9812 0.9986 . All but one window among the very small percentage of misclassified pluripotent windows are assigned to the colony surrounding so pluripotent windows are essentially never classified as differentiated. This is significant for tissue engineering application where all cells must be differentiated before making use of the tissue.

Differentiated and exterior accuracy is 89 90 CI 0.8547 0.9196 and 96 90 CI 0.9432 0.9812 respectively. Usually hESC colonies diffuse as they differentiate and thus approximately 70 of misclassified differentiated windows are assigned to the exterior with the remainder being unclassifiable. Thus no differentiated cell was misclassified as pluripotent. This is significant for large scale hESC cultivation where pluripotent colonies must not be uncontaminated.

Results in give accuracy results for a variety of classification k k and modeling wavelet basis parameters. Note that pluripotent accuracy is highly robust to changes in these values. Differentiated accuracy varies but is acceptable with wavelets of eight taps or less Sym4 and left . Blue indicates pluripotent green differentiated and red exterior. The bar indicates the 90 CT and the diamond the mean of the distribution.

As noted these results used GGD densities to model wavelet coefficients. By way of comparison results with S S models are shown in for the typical set of model parameters. While pluripotent accuracy is relatively unchanged differentiated accuracy decreases noticeably 82 down from 89 validating the use of GGD density models in this application.

In addition shows the nuclei of five cells imaged using the marker FGP H2B in a time lapse series of ten or eleven images over a ten minute period. Using a k nearest neighbor classifier the summed KLD classification results for the images in the five classes are given in . For each nucleus on the y axis a white square has been placed to indicate the five least dissimilar nuclei i.e. smallest summed KLD along the x axis. Blocks along the diagonal indicate correct image classification while off diagonal entries indicate low dissimilarity from a given nucleus to another class. With only a single exception the majority of the nearest neighbors are from the correct class. Note also that the model coefficient selection method enabled the classification of pluripotent class two the shape of this cell is so irregular as to preclude selection of a rectangular region sufficient for statistical texture analysis.

Note also that the non parametric statistical model increases class separation between the nuclei. Consider which shows the actual dissimilarity measure between nucleus eleven and the nuclei in classes one and two. The bottom strip illustrates the KLD from the Parzen model in only one case nucleus four is a class one nucleus further from nucleus eleven than any class two nucleus. This is a clear advantage over the GGD model shown on the top strip which exhibits very poor class separation for this nucleus.

Biological validation of the algorithm was performed by testing large numbers of pluripotent hESC and trophectoderm colonies to show reproducible significant differences between stem cell classes and evaluating subtle differences over time during differentiation Erb manuscript submitted . The approach has also been used to evaluate subtle differences in the rate of differentiation after application of the drug trichostatin A Erb manuscript submitted . To illustrate the versatility of our algorithm on other samples is illustrated in .

In and a proof of concept demonstration is shown for a spontaneously differentiated hESC colony line UC06 . In differentiated epithelial dark pigmented exterior feeder and pluripotent cells were distinguished via statistical multiresolution texture methods.

Textural analysis has also been applied to measure dynamic changes in the cytoplasm of an individual egg cell Mangoubi et al. 2007 . Consider the snapshots from a 60 frame time lapse image series of a Rhesus macaque egg in . The healthy egg at 0 hours undergoes visible textural changes at a later frame as it is damaged by a shift in pH of the media 6 and 10 hrs . By frame 30 the egg becomes more granular and by frame 60 the atretic egg has undergone lysis and contraction. The GGD textural model was used to compare the first and last images used in the sequence to intermediate sequence frames during egg cell death and demonstrate with fidelity the change in texture status during pH shock induced egg death.

Human embryonic stem cells hESC line UC06 from the NIH approved registry were grown under standard conditions on mouse feeder cells. Pluripotency of hESC was routinely confirmed by immunostaining for the pluripotency marker Oct 4. hESCs were induced to differentiate for up to 5 weeks by plating on feeder cells at half the normal density which induced differentiation to early neuronal lineages as determined by the neural markers nestin sox2 and pax6 Ozolek et al. 2007 . We visualized chromatin in living cells by transfecting cells with DNA for the histone H2B linked to the fluorescent protein GFP Kanda et al. 1998 . 4 D movies were acquired with a spinning disk microscope Perkin Elmer Ultraview using a 40 1.3 NA Nikon objective with a resolution of 0.2 m. Single confocal slices are presented in at three times one minute blue channel five minute green channel and ten min red channel . Static images have blue green red at all pixels and thus are gray while nuclei that move during the ten minute interval retain color.

Nuclei in pluripotent cells had smooth textured chromatin that changed over time by internal movement or by whole nuclei movement . During differentiation chromatin became more granular and movement was reduced and . By five weeks differentiated stem cell nuclei were nearly as granular as an adult human vascular endothelial cell nuclei . Pluripotent nuclei are physically very plastic and become less compliant during differentiation due in part to increasing chromatin condensation into heterochromatin Pajerowski et al. 2007 . Since heterochromatin generally contains silenced genes texture analysis provides a direct measure of the degree of global gene silencing by chromatin remodeling.

Pluripotent hESCs line WA07 were grown feeder free on Geltrex coated plates Invitrogen and maintained in StemPro Invitrogen a defined pluripotency media. Media was changed every other day and colonies were passaged weekly with Collagenase Type IV.

Alternately pluripotent hESCs lines WA07 and UC06 were grown on mitomycin treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and maintained in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 20 Knockout serum replacement 2 mM L glutamine Non Essential Amino Acids 100 U ml Penicillin 100 g ml Streptomycin 4 ng ml bFGF all from Invitrogen . Media was changed every other day and colonies were passaged weekly with either a Pasteur pipette or by enzymatic digestion using Collagenase Type IV as recommended by the provider WiCell or UCSF respectively . Mixed colony differentiation on feeders was obtained spontaneously by culture for 2 weeks without passaging to new plates.

hESC colonies were fixed with 2 paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer permeabilized with 1 Triton X 100 Sigma St. Louis Mo. and non specific antibody binding blocked with 10 goat serum. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1 goat serum spun briefly and incubated overnight at 0 C. After a wash in PBS Tween 0.05 a species specific fluorescent secondary antibody was added for 60 min at 37 C. and then incubated in DNA dye Hoechst 33342 1 10 000 . Colonies were immunostained with anti OCT4 R D systems or CDX2 Biogenex and imaged using a Zeiss 20 objective and Axiocam MR5 camera. The Hoechst image of 4 independent colonies were segmented by a watershed segmentation thresholding and size exclusion using the McMaster Biophotonics Facility Image J plug ins for Nuclear Counting Particle Analysis . Cell area in a cropped confluent monolayer was determined by dividing image area by the nuclear count. All images were imported into Adobe Photoshop for final image composition and contrast adjustment. Comparable images were adjusted using constant contrast to allow comparison of channel intensity.

Colonies were imaged via phase contrast microscopy using a 4 Nikon 0.13 NA objective on a TMS cell culture microscope with a 10M Pixel Nikon D40x SLR camera.

Image stacks were acquired with 0.23 m thickness.

In somatic cells heterochromatin and euchromatin have distinctly different densities and sharp boundaries measured by fluorescent intensity and can be quantified deterministically by area measurements. Heterochromatin condensation in stem cells cannot be measured by area measurements alone because the shape density and scale of heterochromatin domains vary continuously during differentiation. A biological feature we have successfully used to quantify chromatin condensation is multiscalar texture or the variation pattern in chromatin intensity. Texture is sensitive to intensity variations that exhibit at least two characteristics They are 1 random in nature and 2 the variations occur at various spatial scales.

Wavelet analysis Do and Vetterli 2002 was used within Matlab environment to decompose the nucleus texture. Wavelet analysis is a generalization of Fourier analysis that quantifies the degree at which pixel intensity varies at multiple scales or electronic magnifications. A statistical comparison of these variations classifies the texture into measurably distinct degrees of chromatin condensation. We evaluated three statistical methods for comparing the wavelet coefficients 1 A parametric density function specifically generalized Gaussian Mangoubi et al. 2008 2 a non parametric classifier method specifically Support Vector Machines SVM Jeffreys et al. 2007 and 3 a non parametric Kolmogorov Smirnov test Lowry et al 2010 . We applied the parametric approach for the current analysis.

It has been verified that a generalized Gaussian GG distribution is appropriate for describing the statistical random behavior of the coefficients of the texture s wavelet decomposition at each subband. Specifically 

By decomposing a nucleus image texture into B subbands we therefore have a statistical feature representation of that texture consisting of parameters b 1 . . . B. We verify that for pluripotent nuclei the values of these parameters are similar to each other and distinct from the same parameter values of differentiated cell nuclei. Consequently each nucleus depending on the degree of differentiation can be mapped into a particular generalized Gaussian joint density through wavelet based texture analysis. For a nucleus of developmental class i pluripotent early differentiated late differentiated this joint density is given by

The larger the distance is the more distinguishable are the two classes. Note that this distance measure is directional and may be either positive or negative and is in general is not symmetric meaning D f g D g f . In practice we employ a symmetric positive measure by replacing D f g by the sum of the absolute values of D f g and D g f or D f g D g f .

To get a feeling for the K L distance we refer to the more familiar Gaussian density. Consider two Gaussian densities with means mand m and the same standard deviation of one. Then the above distance reduces to m mor m m meaning the difference between the two means. For our generalized Gaussian model where the mean is zero but where the scale and width parameters and are different the K L distance between two densities fand fgiven by 19 reduces to 

The distance 21 between pairs of nuclei is then be used to cluster nuclei and classify them based on the degree to which heterochromatin is present or being formed without prior assumptions about the shape and density of heterochromatin loci as we show in the results section for three different classes of neuronal development.

hESC and mESC colonies on MEF feeders were collected by dissecting colonies with a pulled glass pipette. Colonies were aspirated from plates mixed with 2 reducing sample buffer and heated at 95 C. for 10 min.
