The present disclosure provides sensor ports configured to receive a plurality of analyte sensors having different electrode configurations and or different sizes and or shapes. These sensor ports find use in a variety of devices including e.g. analyte meters analyte monitoring devices and or systems e.g. an integrated device in communication with an implanted or partially implanted analyte monitoring device and drug delivery systems and or devices.

Sensor Port Configured to Receive Analyte Sensors Having Opposing and Co Planar Electrode Configurations

In some embodiments a sensor port according to the present disclosure is configured such that it is capable of receiving at least two different types of analyte sensors e.g. a first type having an opposing electrode configuration and a second type having a co planar electrode configuration. As used in the context of the analyte sensors described herein the term opposing electrode configuration means that at least one of the electrodes of the analyte sensor is positioned in opposition to another electrode of the analyte sensor e.g. by being positioned on opposing substrates of the analyte sensor. As used in the context of the analyte sensors described herein the term co planar electrode configuration means that all of the electrodes of the analyte sensor are positioned in the same horizontal plane e.g. by all electrodes being positioned on a common substrate of the analyte sensor. Thus in some embodiments a sensor port according to the present disclosure may be used to receive the first type of analyte sensor at a first time point and the same sensor port may be used to receive the second type of analyte sensor at a second time point. In some embodiments the analytes measured using the first and second types of analyte sensors are the same. In other embodiments the analytes measured using the first and second types of analyte sensors are different e.g. glucose and ketone.

In one embodiment as illustrated in and a sensor port includes a sensor port housing and is configured to receive a first analyte sensor having an opposing electrode configuration and a second analyte sensor having a co planar electrode configuration.

In some embodiments sensor port housing is a two part structure having a top portion and a bottom portion See e.g. which engage to form sensor port housing . Top portion and bottom portion may engage via a variety of different engagement mechanisms. For example the figures set forth herein depict an embodiment in which connection stilts are inserted through connection stilt receiving holes to engage top portion with bottom portion . Secured by top portion and bottom portion are various sensor port contacts that provide electrical connection between an inserted analyte sensor e.g. analyte sensor or and a device including sensor port e.g. an analyte meter See e.g. .

Any suitable conductive material or combination of conductive materials known in the art may be utilized for the sensor port contacts e.g. tempered phosphor bronze e.g. UNS C51000 5 Sn UNS C52100 8 Sn and UNS C52400 10 Sn beryllium copper e.g. UNS C17000 UNS 17200 and UNS 17300 titanium nickel stainless steel platinum carbon gold etc. provided the material is sufficiently conductive to allow transfer of an electrical signal from one or more electrodes of an inserted analyte sensor. While the above refers to a two part housing structure it should be noted that in other embodiments housing may be formed as a single structural unit e.g. injection molded as a single structural unit.

An exemplary configuration for the various sensor port contacts of sensor port is now described with reference to and . Top portion includes sensor port contacts and . Bottom portion includes sensor port contacts and . In one embodiment sensor port contacts are configured and positioned in sensor port such that sensor port contacts and contact electrode contacts present on an analyte sensor having an opposing electrode configuration when the analyte test strip is inserted into sensor port See e.g. and sensor port contacts and contact electrode contacts present on an analyte sensor having a co planar electrode configuration See e.g. when the analyte sensor is inserted into sensor port . Thus in some embodiments at least one sensor port contact e.g. sensor port contact is configured to contact an electrode contact of a first analyte sensor having an opposing electrode configuration and an electrode contact of a second analyte sensor having a co planar electrode configuration.

It should be noted that in some embodiments the relative positioning of top portion and bottom portion could be reversed to produce a bottom mount design in which portion includes sensor port contacts and and portion includes sensor port contacts and .

Examples of suitable analyte sensors e.g. test strips having opposing or co planar electrode configurations are depicted in . As shown in an analyte sensor has an opposing electrode configuration with electrode contact positioned on a first substrate electrode contacts and positioned on a second substrate wherein the first and second substrates are separated by a spacer not shown . Additional embodiments of analyte sensors are shown in and . Analyte sensors of this type include analyte test strips available from Abbott Diabetes Care Inc. Alameda Calif. e.g. FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite glucose monitoring test strips. As shown in analyte sensors have a co planar electrode configuration with electrode contacts and positioned on a substrate . Analyte sensors of this type include analyte test strips available from Abbott Diabetes Care Inc. Alameda Calif. e.g. Precision Extra and Precision XceedPro glucose and ketone monitoring test strips.

In one embodiment with reference to and B the sensor port is configured such that upon insertion of analyte sensor into sensor port electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact and electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact . With reference to and C sensor port is also configured such that upon insertion of analyte sensor into sensor port electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact and electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact . Thus a sensor port capable of receiving both analyte sensors having an opposing electrode configuration and analyte sensors having a co planar electrode configuration is provided.

In some embodiments a sensor port according to the present disclosure will include additional sensor port contacts which provide additional functionality to a device which includes the sensor port .

The sensor ports disclosed herein can include one or more sensor port contacts which function as turn on monitor contact s . In one embodiment sensor port includes optional sensor port contacts and as depicted in which function as turn on monitor contacts. Turn on monitor contacts and are configured to contact a corresponding turn on monitor present on an analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor as shown in . In combination with the turn on monitor the turn on monitor contacts and facilitate certain functions of a device which includes a sensor port e.g. an analyte meter . For example in one embodiment turn on monitor contacts and are designed to facilitate detection of an analyte sensor by analyte meter upon insertion of analyte sensor into sensor port . In one embodiment such detection results in activation of analyte meter for testing i.e. turn on monitor facilitates a turn on function of analyte meter in the absence of further action by the user such as manipulation of a switch on the analyte meter.

It should be noted that while the configuration shown for turn on monitor contacts and in is such that they contact a turn on monitor having the shape and or configuration shown in such a configuration is merely exemplary and the configuration of the turn on monitor contacts can be varied to accommodate turn on monitors having a variety of different shapes and or configurations as discussed in more detail below. For example in one embodiment turn on monitor contacts and are configured such that they both contact a turn on monitor having the shape and or configuration shown in .

In addition or alternatively the sensor ports disclosed herein can include one or more sensor port contacts which function as assay determination contacts. Assay determination contacts allow an analyte meter or other device including a sensor port to determine that the analyte sensor is configured for a particular type of analyte measurement assay. For example in one embodiment sensor port includes optional sensor port contact as depicted in which functions either alone or in combination with one of the other sensor port contacts as an assay determination contact. Assay determination contact is configured to contact a corresponding assay indicator contact present on an analyte sensor configured to perform a particular type of analyte measurement assay e.g. an analyte sensor configured to perform a particular type of analyte measurement assay e.g. a glucose measurement assay or a ketone measurement assay.

In some embodiments an assay determination contact e.g. an assay determination contact works together with one of the other sensor port contacts of sensor port to provide a particular functionality. For example in one embodiment as depicted in assay determination contact together with sensor port contact contact assay indicator contact to complete an electrical circuit which indicates to a device including sensor port that the analyte sensor is configured for a particular assay e.g. a glucose measurement assay or a ketone measurement assay.

Assay determination contact together with sensor port contact can also facilitate determination of the assay configuration of an analyte sensor lacking an assay indicator contact . For example failure to complete an electrical circuit between determination contact and sensor port contact due to the absence of indicator contact can indicate one of two analyte sensor assay configurations e.g. glucose measurement while completion of the electrical circuit due to the presence of indicator contact indicates the second analyte sensor assay configuration e.g. ketone measurement. Accordingly differently configured analyte sensors can be configured for identification by the sensor port by either including or not including an assay indicator contact such as assay indicator contact .

In some embodiments an assay determination contact either alone or in combination with another sensor port contact functions as a turn on monitor contact and vice versa. In other words in some embodiments an assay determination contact can provide a turn on function and in some embodiments a turn on monitor contact can provide an assay determination function to a device which includes a sensor port e.g. an analyte meter .

As discussed above in some embodiments detection of the turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact is accomplished electrically. For example a turn on monitor and or assay indicator contact can be configured to close or open an electrical circuit when the analyte sensor is inserted into the sensor port of an analyte meter. In some embodiments closing or opening the electrical circuit in turn activates the analyte meter for testing. The turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact can include a conductive material which facilitates electrical detection of the turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact. For example in the embodiment shown in turn on monitor includes a conductive material in the form of a conductive strip extending across an exterior surface of analyte sensor .

In some embodiments the turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact is designed such that it physically opens or closes an electric circuit in an analyte meter upon insertion. For example the turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact could be configured as a dimple or a protrusion which physically opens or closes an electric circuit upon insertion of the analyte sensor into the sensor port.

In other embodiments detection of the analyte sensor and or determination of the assay configuration of the analyte sensor is accomplished mechanically without the analyte sensor directly opening or closing an electrical circuit. For example the turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact may have a physical structure which engages with a corresponding physical structure in the sensor port e.g. in a lock and key type configuration. The turn on monitor and or the assay indicator contact may include a first physical structure configured to engage with a second physical structure present in the sensor port wherein the physical structure present on the analyte sensor includes at least one cutout and or protrusion wherein the shape dimensions and or number of the at least one cutout and or protrusion engages with a corresponding physical structure in the sensor port. The forming of a particular cutout and or protrusion shape may be accomplished by several methods. For example the specific cutout and or protrusion shape may be formed by cutting to a desired shape. The cutting may be done by for example a laser such as a laser ablation method. The sensor port can be configured such that this physical interaction in turn facilitates turn on and or assay configuration determination functions of the analyte meter as described above.

Turn on monitors and or assay indicator contacts may have any suitable configuration including but not limited to a stripe extending across the analyte sensor from a side edge to a side edge such as the embodiment shown in a stripe extending across the analyte sensor although not the entire width and an array of unconnected dots strips or other areas. In some embodiments a turn on monitor and or assay indictor contact is configured to convey calibration information for the analyte sensor to a device including a sensor port . Suitable configurations which may be utilized for turn on monitors and or assay configuration contacts are provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006 0091006 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0267823 U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 745 U.S. Pat. No. 6 143 164 U.S. Pat. No. 6 071 391 U.S. Pat. No. 6 503 381 U.S. Pat. No. 6 616 819 U.S. Pat. No. 6 773 671 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 893 545 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure provides sensor ports configured to receive a plurality of analyte sensors having different widths e.g. a plurality of analyte test strips having different widths.

In one embodiment in order to facilitate insertion and proper positioning of the analyte sensors in the sensor port the sensor port includes an optional biasing mechanism configured to bias the analyte sensor against a side wall of the sensor port. Such a configuration allows for positioning of the analyte sensors against a common side wall of the sensor port regardless of the differing widths of the analyte sensors. This in turn facilitates positioning of the analyte sensors relative to the fixed sensor port contacts of the sensor port.

The biasing mechanism may be incorporated into a sensor port configured to receive analyte sensors having opposing and co planar electrode configurations as described previously herein. Alternatively the biasing mechanism may be incorporated into a sensor port configured to receive analyte sensors having only opposing or co planer electrode configurations.

The biasing mechanism may be constructed of any suitable material provided the material is sufficiently flexible to be deflected from the insertion path of the test strips to be inserted while exerting sufficient force against the inserted test strip to hold it in position against a wall of the test strip port. In some embodiments the biasing mechanism is in the form of a spring. The spring may be formed from the same material used to form the housing of the test strip port and in some embodiments may be a portion of the housing itself. Alternatively the spring may be formed from a suitable metal polymer etc. and attached to and or positioned in the sensor port housing. In some embodiments the biasing mechanism is made from a conductive material. In such embodiments it may be desirable to configure the biasing mechanism such that it is electrically grounded.

With reference to A C and A C a sensor port is provided which includes a biasing mechanism . In the context of biasing member exerts sufficient force against analyte sensor to bias analyte sensor against the right side wall of sensor port . Similarly in the context of biasing member exerts sufficient force against analyte sensor to bias analyte sensor against the right side wall of sensor port . The sensor port contacts of sensor port are positioned such that when a correctly biased analyte sensor or a correctly biased analyte sensor is inserted the analyte sensor contacts the appropriate sensor port contacts as discussed previously herein. Accordingly an analyte sensor port having a fixed sensor port contact arrangement can be configured to accept both an analyte sensor and an analyte sensor despite the differing widths of the analyte sensors.

Although the figures depict biasing member as positioned on the left hand side of sensor port it should be understood that such a configuration is for illustration purposes only. For example a biasing member could be positioned on the right hand side of sensor port in order to bias analyte sensors against the left side wall of sensor port . The sensor port contacts can be repositioned as needed to accommodate for a different positioning of the biasing member. Sensor port could also include multiple biasing members e.g. biasing members positioned on both the right and left sides of sensor port to bias an inserted analyte sensor to a central position in sensor port . The sensor port contacts can be repositioned as needed to accommodate for the positioning of multiple biasing members.

In another embodiment with reference to a sensor port is provided which includes a sensor port housing which is configured to include first and second stop positions and in the interior of sensor port . Sensor port housing is configured such that during the analyte sensor insertion process the forward progress of a first analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor B and D is stopped when it reaches first stop position . Sensor port housing is further configured such that during a second analyte sensor insertion process the forward progress of a second analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor is stopped when it reaches second stop position positioned farther along the analyte sensor insertion path than first stop position . As depicted in this can be accomplished for example by configuring sensor port housing such that insertion area extending from sensor port opening to first stop position is wider than insertion area extending from first stop position to the second stop position . It should be noted that the dimensions of insertion areas and and the relative positioning of stop positions and in sensor port may be modified based on the dimensions e.g. length and width of the analyte sensors which the sensor port is configured to receive.

With reference to sensor port is further configured to include two sets of sensor port contacts a first set configured to make electrical contact with electrode contacts of a first analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor and a second set configured to make electrical contact with electrode contacts of a second analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor . In the embodiment depicted in the first set of sensor port contacts is configured to make electrical contact with an analyte sensor having an opposing electrode configuration and the second set of sensor port contacts is configured to make electrical contact with an analyte sensor having a coplanar electrode configuration. It should be noted however that the positioning of the first and second sets could be reversed depending on the relative widths and electrode configurations of the analyte sensors to be inserted. In addition in some embodiments the sensor port may be configured to accept two analyte sensors of differing widths having coplanar electrode configurations or two analyte sensors of differing widths having opposing electrode configurations.

With reference to in one embodiment the first set of sensor port contacts includes sensor port contacts and configured such that upon insertion of analyte sensor into sensor port electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact and electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact . Again with reference to the second set of sensor port contacts includes sensor port contacts and . In this embodiment sensor port is configured such that upon insertion of analyte sensor into sensor port electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact and electrode contact comes into contact with sensor port contact . Thus a sensor port capable of receiving analyte sensors having different widths is provided.

In one embodiment e.g. as depicted in sensor port includes optional sensor port contacts and which function as turn on monitor contacts as described previously herein.

In some embodiments the sensor ports disclosed herein are configured to receive analyte sensors e.g. analyte test strips configured to include a voltage driven fill indicator. An analyte sensor configured to include a voltage driven fill indicator can include a fill indicator which is visible at an end of the analyte sensor e.g. an end of the analyte sensor other than an end which is inserted into the analyte meter during the analyte measurement process. In one embodiment the inclusion of a voltage driven fill indicator can be implemented using a film which darkens or changes color when sufficient voltage is applied to it. An additional electrode can be included in the analyte sensor which is configured to make electrical contact with the film. The film can be variously positioned on the analyte sensor including e.g. at an end of the analyte sensor.

An analyte meter configured to receive an analyte sensor including a voltage driven fill indicator can be configured to sense when the analyte sensor is sufficiently full of liquid e.g. blood . This can be accomplished for example through the use of sensor port contacts configured to contact a pair of fill indicator electrodes. Additional description of fill indicator electrodes is provided below and in the materials incorporated by reference herein. The analyte meter can be configured such that when the analyte meter senses that the analyte sensor is sufficiently full of liquid it applies a voltage to an electrochromic film positioned between the additional electrode and a ground electrode.

An analyte sensor ejector may be useful for example where it is desirable to eject an analyte test strip containing a sample of bodily fluid e.g. blood following an analyte measurement conducted using an analyte meter including the sensor port. This allows a user of the analyte meter to dispose of the contaminated analyte test strip without touching the analyte test strip.

In some embodiments as shown in A B A and B an analyte sensor ejector slidably engages bottom portion of sensor port housing . The analyte sensor ejector may be configured such that upon insertion of an analyte sensor e.g. an analyte sensor into sensor port analyte sensor ejector is moved rearward with respect to the sensor port and in the direction of insertion as shown in . In order to eject the analyte sensor a user physically moves the analyte sensor ejector forward with respect to the sensor port and in the opposite of the direction of insertion as shown in . This movement in turn exerts force upon the analyte sensor expelling it from the sensor port . Alternatively the analyte sensor ejector may be configured such that insertion of the analyte sensor into a sensor port of the analyte meter positions the analyte sensor ejector in a cocked position e.g. by engaging a spring mechanism. The analyte meter may include a button switch or other suitable mechanism for releasing the cocked ejector from the cocked position such that it ejects the analyte sensor from the sensor port of the analyte meter.

In some embodiments a sensor port as disclosed herein is optionally configured as a contamination resistant sensor port and or a splash proof sensor port.

Additional disclosure and examples of contamination resistant sensor ports are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 539 217 filed Aug. 11 2009 and entitled Analyte Sensor Ports the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments the sensor ports described herein can be configured to work with e.g. engage with or operate in connection with additional mechanisms and or devices designed to limit and or prevent contamination of the internal areas of the sensor ports themselves or the internal areas of the electrical devices into which the sensor ports can be integrated. For example mechanisms devices and methods of protecting sensor port openings are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0234559 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0119709 the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments a sensor port as disclosed herein is optionally configured as a fluid wicking sensor port interface. In some such embodiments the sensor port is configured to include one or more hydrophilic and or absorptive materials positioned in proximity to an opening in the sensor port wherein the opening is configured to receive an analyte sensor e.g. an analyte test strip. The hydrophilic and or absorptive materials may be positioned for example surrounding or substantially surrounding the opening in the sensor port. In some embodiments the one or more hydrophilic and or absorptive materials are positioned above and or below the sensor port opening. In other embodiments the one or more hydrophilic and or absorptive materials are positioned to the left and or right of the sensor port opening. In some embodiments the one or more hydrophilic and or absorptive materials define at least a portion of the opening in the sensor port.

In certain embodiments one or more e.g. 2 rotating absorptive guards are positioned in relation to the sensor port opening e.g. directly above and or below the sensor port opening such that during insertion of an analyte sensor e.g. an analyte test strip the absorptive guards each rotate while making contact with the analyte sensor. The rotating absorptive guards can be configured to engage the sensor port housing or the analyte meter housing e.g. by engaging one or more shafts positioned on the sensor port housing or the analyte meter housing. The rotating action of the absorptive guards e.g. about the one or more shafts can mitigate added resistance which may be experienced by the user as a result of contact between the analyte sensor and the one or more absorptive guards as the user inserts the analyte sensor into the sensor port. In some embodiments once the analyte sensor is inserted the absorptive guards form a barrier at the point or points of contact with the analyte sensor such that unwanted or excess fluid is prevented or at least substantially inhibited from entering the sensor port opening. The one or more rotating absorptive guards may be disposable and or replaceable. For example the absorptive guards may be configured such that they can be easily removed from the sensor port for cleaning disposal and or replacement. In one embodiment the rotating absorptive guards have a substantially cylindrical shape however an absorptive guard having any suitable shape may be utilized.

In some embodiments a sensor port configured as a fluid wicking sensor port interface includes one or more paths and or channels sized for capillary action which are positioned relative to the opening in the sensor port such that they facilitate the wicking of fluid away from the opening in the sensor port. These one or more paths and or channels may include a hydrophilic and or absorptive material and or coating. In some embodiments the one or more paths and or channels include a mechanism by which air when displaced by fluid can escape the one or more paths and or channels. For example in one embodiment the one or more paths and or channels connect to one or more additional paths and or channels which provide an opening to the external environment of an analyte meter which incorporates a sensor port as described herein. In some embodiments the one or more paths and or channels are positioned to facilitate flow of fluid in the general direction of a gravitational force applied during the insertion process. In some embodiments the one or more paths and or channels terminate in a reservoir positioned for example in the housing of the sensor port or the housing of an analyte meter configured to include the sensor port.

In some embodiments a fluid wicking sensor port interface is configured to provide one or more alternative paths for a fluid which are more energetically favorable than a path which would bring the fluid into the internal environment of the sensor port through the opening in the sensor port.

In some embodiments the fluid wicking portion of a fluid wicking sensor port interface according to the present disclosure is separately disposable and or replaceable. In other embodiments the fluid wicking portion is physically integrated with the sensor port housing and or the housing of an analyte meter which includes a sensor port according to the present disclosure such that the fluid wicking portion is not configured to be separately disposable and or replaceable.

In additional embodiments the hydrophilic and or absorptive material and or coating may include a material which changes color when contacted with a fluid. This may provide for example an indication that excess fluid was subject to wicking action by the hydrophilic and or absorptive material and or coating.

While the fluid wicking sensor port interface has been described above with reference to the sensor ports disclosed herein it should be noted that the features of the fluid wicking sensor port interface may provide similar effects when used in connection with other openings in analyte meters or openings in other devices. For example the features of the fluid wicking sensor port interface may be used to prevent or inhibit fluid ingress into a battery compartment or communication port of an analyte meter.

Improper insertion and or insertion of a damaged analyte sensor can in some cases damage a sensor port contact such as sensor port contact by compressing or otherwise deforming the electrode contact from its intended positioning. For example during the handling of an analyte sensor a proximal portion of substrate on which electrode contact is positioned may become bent e.g. as shown in . If a user were to insert such a damaged analyte sensor sensor port contact could be compressed or otherwise deformed by contact with the damaged analyte sensor. Protective protrusion is configured to prevent such contact between a damaged analyte sensor and a sensor port contact.

In some embodiments the analyte meter includes a data storage unit e.g. a data storage unit not shown in operably connected to the processing unit e.g. as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 396 182 filed Mar. 31 2006 titled Analyte Monitoring Devices and Methods Therefor the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Data storage unit is depicted as a system component along with processing unit in .

In some embodiments the processing unit is configured to perform medication dosage calculation functions such as a single dose calculation function for injection of rapid acting insulin and or long acting insulin. Analyte meters which include medication dosage calculation functions and methods of performing the dosage calculation functions are described for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 396 182 filed Mar. 31 2006 entitled Analyte Monitoring Devices and Methods Therefor in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 699 653 entitled Multi Function Analyte Test Device and Methods Therefor listing Mark K. Sloan as the first named inventor and in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 699 844 entitled Multi Function Analyte Test Device and Methods Therefor listing Mark K. Sloan as the first named inventor the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

In one embodiment the processing unit is configured to perform a bolus calculation function. For example the processing unit may be configured to determine a bolus dosage e.g. an insulin bolus dosage based on the signal received from an analyte sensor.

In one embodiment the processing unit is configured to perform an algorithm to determine a medication dosage based on a determined concentration of analyte.

The analyte meter may be configured to automatically enter into a medication dosage calculation mode to for example calculate and or select a medication dosage amount based on information stored in the analyte meter such as the patient s insulin sensitivity for example and or prompt the patient to provide additional information such as the amount of carbohydrate to be ingested by the patient for determination of for example a carbohydrate bolus dosage determination. The patient may operate an input unit described in greater detail below to provide the appropriate information.

In another embodiment the analyte meter may be configured to prompt the patient to select whether to retrieve a predetermined or preprogrammed medication dosage amount such as for example a correction bolus or a carbohydrate bolus following the display of the determined analyte concentration from the analyte sensor. In this manner in one embodiment of the present disclosure analyte meter may be configured to automatically prompt the user or patient to select whether a medication dosage determination is desired following analyte testing using an analyte sensor.

In one embodiment of the present disclosure the analyte meter may be configured to execute different types of medication dosage calculations based on the patient specified parameters. For example the analyte meter may be configured to perform a carbohydrate bolus determination when the analyte sensor sample analysis is performed within a predetermined time period of a meal event. For example the analyte meter may be programmed by the patient to automatically select the carbohydrate bolus determination if the analyte sensor fluid sample analysis is performed within one hour prior to a meal time which may be programmed into the analyte meter .

In some embodiments a processing unit of an analyte meter or another portable electronic processing device is configured to prompt a user to enter the delivery time of a medication dosage e.g. a medication dosage calculated by the processing unit. For example following a bolus dosage calculation e.g. an insulin bolus dosage calculation the processing unit may automatically prompt the user e.g. using the display unit to enter the time at which the calculated bolus dosage was administered.

In some embodiments the processing unit may be further configured to automatically prompt the user following entry of the administration time to enter the time at which a subsequent meal is started. Such information may then be utilized by the processing unit or an external processing device to optimize future medication dosage calculations.

In some embodiments a processor of an analyte meter device or another portable electronic processing device is configured to provide one or more bolus calculator safety features. As discussed herein an analyte meter according to the present disclosure may be configured to communicate with and receive analyte measurements from an external analyte monitoring device and or system e.g. a continuous glucose monitoring CGM device and or system or a glucose on demand GoD monitoring device and or system.

Where an analyte meter is configured to communicate with and receive analyte measurements from a CGM device and or system e.g. a device and or system including an implanted or partially implanted analyte sensor configured to automatically measure glucose levels at predetermined intervals the processor may be configured to automatically or in response to a user input initiate a process to specifically monitor a user s glucose response to a bolus dose of insulin. For example in some embodiments the processor is configured to provide an expected glucose profile over a period of time using a physiological model associated with one or more of the user s insulin action time glucose trajectory meal input data insulin input data exercise data health data and time of day. The process may provide a minimum acceptable profile where the predicted glucose has a minimum value at a predetermined low glucose safety limit. The process may also provide a maximum acceptable profile where the predicted glucose has a maximum value at a predetermined high glucose safety limit.

These profiles may be determined in a number of ways. For example they may be determined by increasing and decreasing carbohydrate intake until the point that the profile limits are reached. Alternatively meal timing or one or more of the other physiological model parameters may be varied.

The processor may then monitor using the CGM device and or system received real time data to determine if it falls within the minimum and maximum profiles indicated at that point in time. If a predetermined number of glucose readings e.g. one or more fall outside the profile range then the processor can be configured to communicate an alarm and or alert to the user and indicated that the glucose reading was lower or higher than expected. In some embodiments the processing device may then communicate to the user a recommended course of action.

Where an analyte meter is configured to communicate with and receive analyte measurements from a GoD device and or system e.g. a glucose monitoring device and or system including an implanted or partially implanted analyte sensor and requiring user initiation to receive a glucose reading the processor may be configured to prompt the user to obtain a glucose measurement from the GoD device and or system at predetermined time points relative to a bolus administration e.g. at 20 min and 45 min following the bolus administration. These measurements may then be compared to a predetermined glucose profile or profiles. If a predetermined number of glucose readings e.g. one or more fall outside the profile range then the processor can be configured to communicate an alarm and or alert to the user and indicated that the glucose reading was lower or higher than expected. In some embodiments the processing device may then communicate to the user a recommended course of action.

Additional description of glucose on demand devices and or systems can be found in US Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008 0319296 2009 0054749 2009 0294277 2008 0319295 in U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 12 625 524 filed Nov. 24 2009 and entitled RF Tag on Test Strips Test Strip Vials and Boxes and in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61 247 519 filed Sep. 30 2009 and entitled Electromagnetically Coupled On Body Analyte Sensor and System 61 155 889 filed on Feb. 26 2009 and entitled Analyte Measurement Sensors And Methods For Fabricating The Same 61 238 581 filed on Aug. 31 2009 and entitled Analyte Monitoring System with Electrochemical Sensor 61 163 006 filed on Mar. 24 2009 and entitled Methods Of Treatment And Monitoring Systems For Same 61 247 508 filed on Sep. 30 2009 and entitled Methods and Systems for Calibrating On Demand Analyte Measurement Device 61 149 639 filed on Feb. 2 2009 and entitled Compact On Body Physiological Monitoring Devices and Methods Thereof and 61 291 326 filed on Dec. 30 2009 and entitled Ultra High Frequency UHF Loop Antenna for Passive Glucose Sensor and Reader the disclosures of each which are incorporated by reference herein.

Bolus calculator safety features may also be incorporated into analyte meters which are not in communication with external analyte monitoring devices and or systems but which are instead configured for self monitoring of blood glucose SMBG . For example such an analyte meter may include a processor configured to issue an alarm alert or reminder to a user to perform an additional glucose reading at a predetermined time e.g. 5 min following an initial glucose reading and an associated bolus calculation. This allows the processor to determine a rate factor based on the two glucose values separated in time. This rate factor may then be taken into account by the processor in performing a new bolus calculation or providing an adjustment to a previous bolus calculation. In some embodiments the processor may determine that an initial bolus which was fully delivered was too high and that corrective action e.g. ingestion of carbohydrate should be taken to avoid overdelivery.

In some embodiments a portion e.g. 70 of the calculated bolus dose is delivered or recommended for delivery based on an initial glucose reading. Subsequently some all or none of the remaining portion of the calculated bolus may be delivered or recommended for delivery based on a second calculated bolus taking into account the glucose rate determined following the second glucose reading.

Various events e.g. measurement readings nutritional intake information e.g. carbohydrate intake information insulin dosage and times exercise records meal time records note records medication time records etc. may be recorded along with date time tags. Events may be recorded automatically by the analyte meter e.g. upon measurement reading . Alternatively or in addition input elements on the analyte meter may be used by a user to input event data and or non event data.

In some embodiments entry of carbohydrate intake data may be facilitated by providing for the utilization of bar code scanner technology in combination with a database which links product bar codes to carbohydrate information for the product. For example an analyte meter device such as an analyte meter as described herein or another portable electronic processing device may include an integrated bar code reader. In addition the analyte meter or portable electronic processing device may be configured to include e.g. in a data storage unit a database which links a product s bar code to its nutritional content e.g. its carbohydrate content . Alternatively such a database could be stored on a remote device and or system which may be accessed by the analyte meter device or portable electronic processing device e.g. using a communication unit as described herein. In this manner when a user scans a bar code associated with a food item he or she intends to consume the nutritional information e.g. carbohydrate content can be automatically entered into an event log and or database for later analysis.

In another embodiment where a bar code and or corresponding nutritional information are not available a user may utilize digital camera technology e.g. a digital camera incorporated into an analyte meter device or another portable electronic processing device to capture a digital image of a food item to be consumed. Such digital images may then be compared to images of food items having a known nutritional content e.g. using image recognition technology. Alternatively or in addition such digital images may be utilized e.g. by a health care professional in connection with user training designed to assist the user in assessing the carbohydrate content of a food item.

In some embodiments an analyte meter portable electronic processing device and or health management software may be configured to enable a user to tag or link one or more bar code readings or digital images with additional information entered by the user e.g. information related to a subsequent analyte measurement or measurements.

Collected and or analyzed data may be represented visually to the user e.g. on the display unit of the analyte meter and or a remote device . For example data from the event log may be presented in various formats and or further manipulated and presented. Data may be used to generate graphs and reports that help a user such as a diabetic to track glucose and other related information. The test data may be graphed in many ways according to various default or pre programmed graphs or according to filtering and preferences inputs from a user. The graphs may be generated and displayed on the analyte meter and or a remote device e.g. a remote device configured to communicate with the analyte meter.

Remote devices configured to communicate with the analyte meters disclosed herein may be configured for printing the graphs and or reports. The remote devices may also be configured to receive data from a storage unit of the analyte meter and enter such data into a database located on the remote device. A remote device could also be utilized for backing up data and for downloading applications programs to the analyte meter and for communicating with other computers over one or more networks e.g. for viewing of data by the user a physician and or a third party.

Data from the event log may also be used to perform trending calculations. For example an analyte meter according to the present disclosure may be capable of displaying a graph of the analyte level over a period of time. Examples of other graphs that may be useful include graphs of the rate of change or acceleration in the rate of change of the analyte level over time i.e. trending data . Trending data may be used by other applications e.g. in bolus calculations and or alerts.

Trending data may also be presented via a display unit on the analyte meter. The display unit may contain symbols e.g. directional arrows or other indicators that are activated under certain conditions e.g. a particular symbol may become visible on the display when a condition such as hyperglycemia is indicated by signals from the sensor . Other indicators may be activated in the cases of hypoglycemia impending hyperglycemia impending hypoglycemia etc.

Additional information regarding the use of logs and trending by analyte meters can be found within U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 041 468 and 6 175 752 disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

An alert may be activated by the analyte meter and conveyed to the user e.g. via the display unit. An alarm may be activated if an analyte sensor for example indicates a value that is beyond a measurement range of the analyte sensor. An alarm system may also or alternatively be activated when the rate of change or acceleration of the rate of change in analyte level increase or decrease reaches or exceeds a threshold rate or acceleration e.g. to indicate a hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic condition is likely to occur.

An alarm system may be configured to activate when a single data point meets or exceeds a particular threshold value. Alternatively the alarm may be activated only when a predetermined number of data points spanning a predetermined amount of time meet or exceed the threshold value. As another alternative the alarm may be activated only when the data points spanning a predetermined amount of time have an average value which meets or exceeds the threshold value.

The alarm system may contain one or more individual alarms. Each of the alarms may be individually activated to indicate one or more conditions of the analyte. The alarms may be for example auditory or visual. Other sensory stimulating alarm systems may be used including alarm systems which heat cool vibrate or produce a mild electrical shock when activated.

The present disclosure provides software and or firmware configured to perform one or more active scheduling algorithms. An active scheduling algorithm can provide a user of an analyte meter a recommended time and or date for a subsequent therapy administration e.g. by displaying such information on display of analyte meter wherein the recommended time and or date is determined based on a retrospective analysis of previously administered therapies as compared to a recommended therapy sequence and or profile. As used herein the term therapy includes analyte measurement as well as the administration of a medication.

The therapy reminders can be determined and configured by a qualified health care provider such as a physician clinical specialist or nurse. An analyte meter can then be configured with an appropriate scheduling algorithm directly by the health care provider using an optional input unit incorporated into the analyte meter via a data management system that interfaces with the analyte meter and or via another portable device configured to communicate with the analyte meter . In this manner a health care provider can update therapy recommendations electronically and communicate the therapy recommendations to an end user.

In one embodiment a suitable scheduling algorithm provides a reminder to the user based on an analysis of the history of analyte measurements e.g. blood glucose measurements made by the user and compared to scheduled analyte measurements yet to be completed. The scheduling algorithm updates the reminder during the course of the day such that the user is presented with the next scheduled time conforming to the scheduling profile. The dynamic scheduling can continue over multiple days until the user has completed all measurements conforming to the schedule. After the therapies are completed according to the recommended schedule the scheduling algorithm can be configured to reset and start again or alternatively a different scheduling algorithm may be activated.

The scheduling algorithm can be configured to provide feedback to the user at any time during the scheduled therapy administration period. For example the scheduling algorithm can be configured to provide the user with an indication of how much of the schedule has been completed and or how many recorded measurement times did not conform to the recommended measurement time profile.

A non limiting example of a dynamic scheduling procedure according to the present disclosure is as follows A The measurement profile is defined to include the recording of 7 analyte readings before and after lunch with 30 minute separation starting at 1 hour prior to lunch 11 00 am . The recommended times are 11 00 am 11 30 am 12 00 pm 12 30 pm 1 00 pm 1 30 pm and 2 00 pm. B If the user s first analyte measurement is at 12 00 pm the algorithm would recommend that the next measurement be performed at 12 30 pm. C If the user does not perform an analyte measurement at 12 30 pm the algorithm would suggest 1 00 pm and so on. D If the user does perform an analyte measurement later in the day e.g. 8 00 pm this measurement is not considered as advancing the completion of the measurement profile. E If the user on the second day performs an analyte measurement at 12 00 pm this measurement is also not considered as advancing the completion of the measurement profile as it was already completed on the previous day. F If the user on the second day then samples at 1 00 pm this measurement is considered to advance the completion of the measurement profile. Based on the above the analyte meter would display for example a summary report that 29 2 7 of the therapy reminders have been completed and that 2 of the 4 readings did not conform to the scheduled reminders. G In addition the analyte meter would report the outstanding measurement times e.g. 11 00 am 11 30 am 12 30 pm 1 30 pm and 2 00 pm.

An analyte meter may be configured to control a drug administration system based on for example measurement readings. The analyte meter may provide or communicate with a remote device to provide a drug to counteract the high or low level of the analyte in response to a measurement reading and or continuous measurement reading e.g. with an implanted or partially implanted sensor .

The method utilizes glucose history meal information and insulin delivery information in connection with these events as available for a particular device and or system to calculate the optimal parameters specific to the user for the particular device and or system.

For example in one embodiment a simulation for a SMBG device and or system assumes that for each meal bolus event the bolus is based on the meal information and the glucose level but not on glucose trending information. In one embodiment a simulation for a GoD device and or system includes information similar to that for the SMBG device and or system except that trending information is also taken into account for the bolus calculation. In one embodiment a simulation for a CGM device and or system assumes that whenever the glucose measurement exceeds a high or low threshold that a correction bolus occurs based on glucose level and trending information. Alternatively or in addition the CGM simulation may take into account that a correction is triggered based on projected high or low thresholds. Metrics based on the simulation results may be used to provide an indication of acceptable glucose control. The method may be utilized by a health care professional in order to determine the appropriate device for a particular patient and or user.
