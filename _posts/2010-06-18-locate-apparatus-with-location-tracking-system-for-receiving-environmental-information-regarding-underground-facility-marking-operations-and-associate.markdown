Field service operations may be any operation in which companies dispatch technicians and or other staff to perform certain activities for example installations services and or repairs. Field service operations may exist in various industries examples of which include but are not limited to network installations utility installations security systems construction medical equipment heating ventilating and air conditioning HVAC and the like.

An example of a field service operation in the construction industry is a so called locate and marking operation also commonly referred to more simply as a locate operation or sometimes merely as a locate . In a typical locate operation a locate technician visits a work site in which there is a plan to disturb the ground e.g. excavate dig one or more holes and or trenches bore etc. so as to determine a presence or an absence of one or more underground facilities such as various types of utility cables and pipes in a dig area to be excavated or disturbed at the work site. In some instances a locate operation may be requested for a design project in which there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground but nonetheless information about a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities at a work site may be valuable to inform a planning permitting and or engineering design phase of a future construction project.

In many states an excavator who plans to disturb ground at a work site is required by law to notify any potentially affected underground facility owners prior to undertaking an excavation activity. Advanced notice of excavation activities may be provided by an excavator or another party by contacting a one call center. One call centers typically are operated by a consortium of underground facility owners for the purposes of receiving excavation notices and in turn notifying facility owners and or their agents of a plan to excavate. As part of an advanced notification excavators typically provide to the one call center various information relating to the planned activity including a location e.g. address of the work site and a description of the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed at the work site.

Using the information provided in a locate request for planned excavation or design projects the one call center identifies certain underground facilities that may be present at the indicated work site. For this purpose many one call centers typically maintain a collection of polygon maps which indicate within a given geographic area over which the one call center has jurisdiction generally where underground facilities may be found relative to some geographic reference frame or coordinate system.

Polygon maps typically are provided to the one call centers by underground facilities owners within the jurisdiction of the one call center members of the one call center . A one call center first provides the facility owner member with one or more maps e.g. street or property maps within the jurisdiction on which are superimposed some type of grid or coordinate system employed by the one call center as a geographic frame of reference. Using the maps provided by the one call center the respective facilities owners members draw one or more polygons on each map to indicate an area within which their facilities generally are disposed underground without indicating the facilities themselves . These polygons themselves do not precisely indicate geographic locations of respective underground facilities rather the area enclosed by a given polygon generally provides an over inclusive indication of where a given facilities owner s underground facilities are disposed. Different facilities owners members may draw polygons of different sizes around areas including their underground facilities and in some instances such polygons can cover appreciably large geographic regions e.g. an entire subdivision of a residential area which may further obfuscate the actual precise location of respective underground facilities.

Based on the polygon maps collected from the facilities owners members the one call center may in some instances create composite polygon maps to show polygons of multiple different members on a single map. Whether using single member or composite polygon maps the one call center examines the address or location information provided in the locate request and identifies a significant buffer zone around an identified work site so as to make an over inclusive identification of facilities owners members that may have underground facilities present e.g. to err on the side of caution . In particular based on this generally over inclusive buffer zone around the identified work site and in some instances significantly over inclusive buffer zone the one call center consults the polygon maps to identify which member polygons intersect with all or a portion of the buffer zone so as to notify these underground facility owners members and or their agents of the proposed excavation or design project. Again it should be appreciated that the buffer zones around an indicated work site utilized by one call centers for this purpose typically embrace a geographic area that includes but goes well beyond the actual work site and in many cases the geographic area enclosed by a buffer zone is significantly larger than the actual dig area in which excavation or other similar activities are planned. Similarly as noted above the area enclosed by a given member polygon generally does not provide a precise indication of where one or more underground facilities may in fact be found.

In some instances one call centers may also or alternatively have access to various existing maps of underground facilities in their jurisdiction referred to as facilities maps. Facilities maps typically are maintained by facilities owners members within the jurisdiction and show for respective different utility types where underground facilities purportedly may be found relative to some geographic reference frame or coordinate system e.g. a grid a street or property map GPS latitude and longitude coordinates etc. . Facilities maps generally provide somewhat more detail than polygon maps provided by facilities owners members however in some instances the information contained in facilities maps may not be accurate and or complete. For at least this reason whether using polygon maps or facilities maps as noted above the one call center utilizes a significant buffer zone around an identified work site so as to make an over inclusive identification of facilities owners members that may have underground facilities present.

Once facilities implicated by the locate request are identified by a one call center e.g. via the polygon map buffer zone process the one call center generates a locate request ticket also known as a locate ticket or simply a ticket . The locate request ticket essentially constitutes an instruction to inspect a work site and typically identifies the work site of the proposed excavation or design and a description of the dig area typically lists on the ticket all of the underground facilities that may be present at the work site e.g. by providing a member code for the facility owner whose polygon falls within a given buffer zone and may also include various other information relevant to the proposed excavation or design e.g. the name of the excavation company a name of a property owner or party contracting the excavation company to perform the excavation etc. . The one call center sends the ticket to one or more underground facility owners and or one or more locate service providers who may be acting as contracted agents of the facility owners so that they can conduct a locate and marking operation to verify a presence or absence of the underground facilities in the dig area. For example in some instances a given underground facility owner may operate its own fleet of locate technicians e.g. locate technician in which case the one call center may send the ticket to the underground facility owner . In other instances a given facility owner may contract with a locate service provider to receive locate request tickets and perform a locate and marking operation in response to received tickets on their behalf.

Upon receiving the locate request a locate service provider or a facility owner hereafter referred to as a ticket recipient may dispatch a locate technician to the work site of planned excavation to determine a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities in the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed. A typical first step for the locate technician includes utilizing an underground facility locate device which is an instrument or set of instruments also referred to commonly as a locate set for detecting facilities that are concealed in some manner such as cables and pipes that are located underground. The locate device is employed by the technician to verify the presence or absence of underground facilities indicated in the locate request ticket as potentially present in the dig area e.g. via the facility owner member codes listed in the ticket . This process is often referred to as a locate operation. 

In one example of a locate operation an underground facility locate device is used to detect electromagnetic fields that are generated by an applied signal provided along a length of a target facility to be identified. In this example a locate device may include both a signal transmitter to provide the applied signal e.g. which is coupled by the locate technician to a tracer wire disposed along a length of a facility and a signal receiver which is generally a hand held apparatus carried by the locate technician as the technician walks around the dig area to search for underground facilities. illustrates a conventional locate device indicated by the dashed box that includes a transmitter and a locate receiver . The transmitter is connected via a connection point to a target object in this example underground facility located in the ground . The transmitter generates the applied signal which is coupled to the underground facility via the connection point e.g. to a tracer wire along the facility resulting in the generation of a magnetic field . The magnetic field in turn is detected by the locate receiver which itself may include one or more detection antenna not shown . The locate receiver indicates a presence of a facility when it detects electromagnetic fields arising from the applied signal . Conversely the absence of a signal detected by the locate receiver generally indicates the absence of the target facility.

In yet another example a locate device employed for a locate operation may include a single instrument similar in some respects to a conventional metal detector. In particular such an instrument may include an oscillator to generate an alternating current that passes through a coil which in turn produces a first magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is in close proximity to the coil e.g. if an underground facility having a metal component is below near the coil of the instrument eddy currents are induced in the metal and the metal produces its own magnetic field which in turn affects the first magnetic field. The instrument may include a second coil to measure changes to the first magnetic field thereby facilitating detection of metallic objects.

In addition to the locate operation the locate technician also generally performs a marking operation in which the technician marks the presence and in some cases the absence of a given underground facility in the dig area based on the various signals detected or not detected during the locate operation. For this purpose the locate technician conventionally utilizes a marking device to dispense a marking material on for example the ground pavement or other surface along a detected underground facility. Marking material may be any material substance compound and or element used or which may be used separately or in combination to mark signify and or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include but are not limited to paint chalk dye and or iron. Marking devices such as paint marking wands and or paint marking wheels provide a convenient method of dispensing marking materials onto surfaces such as onto the surface of the ground or pavement.

In the mechanical actuation system of the marking device includes an actuator or mechanical trigger proximate to the handle that is actuated triggered by the technician e.g. via pulling depressing or squeezing with fingers hand . The actuator is connected to a mechanical coupler e.g. a rod disposed inside and along a length of the elongated shaft . The coupler is in turn connected to an actuation mechanism at the distal end of the shaft which mechanism extends outward from the shaft in the direction of the spray nozzle . Thus the actuator the mechanical coupler and the actuation mechanism constitute the mechanical actuation system of the marking device .

In some environments arrows flags darts or other types of physical marks may be used to mark the presence or absence of an underground facility in a dig area in addition to or as an alternative to a material applied to the ground such as paint chalk dye tape along the path of a detected utility. The marks resulting from any of a wide variety of materials and or objects used to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities generally are referred to as locate marks. Often different color materials and or physical objects may be used for locate marks wherein different colors correspond to different utility types. For example the American Public Works Association APWA has established a standardized color coding system for utility identification for use by public agencies utilities contractors and various groups involved in ground excavation e.g. red electric power lines and cables blue potable water orange telecommunication lines yellow gas oil steam . In some cases the technician also may provide one or more marks to indicate that no facility was found in the dig area sometimes referred to as a clear .

As mentioned above the foregoing activity of identifying and marking a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities generally is referred to for completeness as a locate and marking operation. However in light of common parlance adopted in the construction industry and or for the sake of brevity one or both of the respective locate and marking functions may be referred to in some instances simply as a locate operation or a locate i.e. without making any specific reference to the marking function . Accordingly it should be appreciated that any reference in the relevant arts to the task of a locate technician simply as a locate operation or a locate does not necessarily exclude the marking portion of the overall process. At the same time in some contexts a locate operation is identified separately from a marking operation wherein the former relates more specifically to detection related activities and the latter relates more specifically to marking related activities.

Inaccurate locating and or marking of underground facilities can result in physical damage to the facilities property damage and or personal injury during the excavation process that in turn can expose a facility owner or contractor to significant legal liability. When underground facilities are damaged and or when property damage or personal injury results from damaging an underground facility during an excavation the excavator may assert that the facility was not accurately located and or marked by a locate technician while the locate contractor who dispatched the technician may in turn assert that the facility was indeed properly located and marked. Proving whether the underground facility was properly located and marked can be difficult after the excavation or after some damage e.g. a gas explosion because in many cases the physical locate marks e.g. the marking material or other physical marks used to mark the facility on the surface of the dig area will have been disturbed or destroyed during the excavation process and or damage resulting from excavation .

Previous efforts at documenting locate operations have focused primarily on locate devices that employ electromagnetic fields to determine the presence of an underground facility. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 576 973 naming inventor Alan Haddy and entitled Apparatus and Method for Obtaining Geographical Positional Data for an Object Located Underground hereafter Haddy is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator that receives and stores data from a global positioning system GPS to identify the position of the locate device as an underground object e.g. a cable is detected by the locate device. Haddy notes that by recording geographical position data relating to the detected underground object there is no need to physically mark the location of the underground object on the ground surface and the recorded position data may be used in the future to re locate the underground object.

Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 7 319 387 naming inventors Willson et al. and entitled GPS Interface for Locating Device hereafter Willson is directed to a locate device for locating position markers i.e. passive antennas that reflect back RF signals and which are installed along buried utilities. In Willson a GPS device may be communicatively coupled to the locate device or alternatively provided as an integral part of the locate device to store GPS coordinate data associated with position markers detected by the locate device. Electronic memory is provided in the locate device for storing a data record of the GPS coordinate data and the data record may be uploaded to a remote computer and used to update a mapping database for utilities.

U.S. Publication No. 2006 0282280 naming inventors Stotz et al. and entitled Ticket and Data Management hereafter Stotz also is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator including a GPS receiver. Upon detection of the presence of a utility line Stotz locate device can update ticket data with GPS coordinates for the detected utility line. Once the locate device has updated the ticket data the reconfigured ticket data may be transmitted to a network.

U.S. Publication No. 2007 0219722 naming inventors Sawyer Jr. et al. and entitled System and Method for Collecting and Updating Geographical Data hereafter Sawyer is directed to collecting and recording data representative of the location and characteristics of utilities and infrastructure in the field for creating a grid or map. Sawyer employs a field data collection unit including a locating pole that is placed on top of or next to a utility to be identified and added to the grid or map. The locating pole includes an antenna coupled to a location determination system such as a GPS unit to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the utility under or next to the end of the locating pole. The data gathered by the field data collection unit is sent to a server to provide a permanent record that may be used for damage prevention and asset management operations.

Applicants have recognized and appreciated that uncertainties which may be attendant to locate and marking operations may be significantly reduced by collecting comprehensive information relating to one or both of the operating conditions of equipment used to perform the locate and or marking operations as well as various environmental conditions present at or near the work site and or in close proximity to the equipment being used.

More specifically Applicants have recognized and appreciated that conventional techniques for using a locate device to detect underground facilities are sometimes tentative and typically iterative in nature and use of locate devices with only rudimentary GPS capabilities in some instances may result in redundant spurious and or incomplete geographic location data collected by such devices. For example during a typical locate operation a technician attempting to locate an underground facility with a locate device often needs to sweep an appreciable area around a suspected underground facility and make multiple passes with the locate device over the underground facility to obtain meaningful detection signals. Furthermore the technician often needs to rely significantly on visual observations of the area including relevant landmarks such as facility connections to buildings transformer boxes maintenance public access points curbs sidewalks roadways etc. to effectively deduce a sensible path of an underground facility to be located. The foregoing is particularly true if at some point during the locate operation the technician loses a signal from an underground facility in the process of being detected e.g. due to a broken transmitter circuit path from a damaged tracer wire and loss of the transmitter test signal . Thus collecting and logging geographic location information throughout this process may result in excessive and or imprecise data or in some instances incomplete relevant data e.g. in the case of signal loss broken tracer wire from which it may be difficult to cull the data that is truly complete and representative of where the underground facility ultimately was detected. Accordingly additional information about other operating conditions of the locate device and or information on existing environmental conditions may in some instances supplement or facilitate identification of information that is perhaps the most relevant to the operation at hand.

In view of the foregoing various embodiments of the present invention are directed to locate devices e.g. locate transmitters and or locate receivers with enhanced features and associated methods and systems to facilitate collection of a wide variety of information relating to a locate operation and provide for creation of a comprehensive and robust electronic record of a locate operation. Locate information relating to use of a locate device to perform a locate operation may be acquired from one or more of a variety of input devices in any of a variety of manners logged stored in local memory of a locate device formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the locate device itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server for storage processing and or analysis.

In some exemplary embodiments described in detail herein a locate device may include one or more environmental sensors and or operational sensors and the locate information may include environmental information and operational information derived from such sensors. Environmental and or operational information may be used to control operation of the locate device assess out of tolerance conditions in connection with use of the locate device and or provide alerts or other feedback. In yet other embodiments additional enhancements are disclosed relating to improving the determination of a location e.g. GPS coordinates of a detecting tip of the locate device e.g. a portion of the locate device close to the ground pavement or other surface below which one or more underground facilities may be disposed during use.

In other embodiments a locate device may be operated in a solo mode or a group mode. In particular in a solo mode the locate device may be operated as an individual independent device to collect store and or transmit data whereas in group mode a locate device may act as a worker device or a leader device to facilitate consolidation of data collected by multiple devices e.g. and relating to a same ticket at a single one of the devices at a host server or at any other suitable location.

In yet other embodiments a locate device may be equipped with an enhanced user interface having tactile functionality in particular the locate device may include one or more tactile indicators e.g. vibrating devices disposed for example in a handle joy stick actuator or elsewhere on the device to provide a tactile indication to a technician using the locate device e.g. as feedback in connection with an operating mode operating condition environmental condition etc. .

During and or following collection and or storage of information regarding the locate operation data compiled in one or more electronic records associated with the locate operation may be accessed processed and or analyzed to provide further information relating to the performance of the locate operation. For example in other embodiments disclosed herein data from one or more electronic records of the locate operation is processed so as to electronically render visually recreate the locate operation e.g. on a display device associated with the locate device or other display device . Electronic renderings may be generated statically e.g. in which all available data in an electronic record is rendered essentially simultaneously on an available display field or in an animated time sequenced recreation of the locate operation e.g. based on at least timing and geographic location information in the electronic record once an electronic record is generated. In yet another exemplary implementation various information to be logged in an electronic record may be passed transmitted in essentially real time to one or more display devices to facilitate an essentially real time electronic rendering on an available display field of a locate operation in process.

In one exemplary implementation a Linux based processing system for embedded handheld and or wireless devices may be employed in the locate receiver to implement various components of the control electronics . For example the Fingertip4 processing system including a Marvell PXA270 processor and available from InHand Electronics Inc. www.inhandelectronics.com products fingertip4 may be used. In addition to the PXA270 processor e.g. serving as the processor the Fingertip4 includes flash memory and SDRAM e.g. serving as local memory multiple serial ports a USB port and other I O interfaces e.g. to facilitate interfacing with one or more input devices and other components of the locate receiver supports a variety of wired and wireless interfaces WiFi Bluetooth GPS Ethernet any IEEE 802.11 interface or any other suitable wireless interface to facilitate implementation of the communication interface and connects to a wide variety of LCD displays to facilitate implementation of a user interface display . In yet other exemplary implementations the processor may be realized by multiple processors that divide share some or all of the functionality discussed herein in connection with the processor . For example in one implementation an Atom processor available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara Calif. may be used alone or in connection with one or more PIC processors to accomplish various functionality described herein.

Communication interface of locate receiver may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between locate receiver and an external or remote device such as a remote computing device that is elsewhere in the dig area i.e. not a part of the locate receiver or outside the dig area. For example data that is provided by components of data acquisition system and or stored in local memory e.g. one or more electronic records may be transmitted via communication interface to a remote computer such as remote computer for processing. Examples of wired communication interfaces may include but are not limited to USB ports RS232 connectors RJ45 connectors Ethernet and any combination thereof.

As described below the display may also be used in some embodiments of the invention to display various images germane to a locate and or marking information as well as information relating to a placement of marking material in a dig area a location of an underground facility in a dig area or any other suitable information that may be displayed based on information acquired to create an electronic record .

In various embodiments the one or more interfaces of the locate receiver including the communication interface and user interface may be used as input devices to receive information to be stored in the memory to facilitate various functions of the locate receiver and or to be logged as part of an electronic record of a locate operation. In some cases locate information received via the interface s e.g. via the communication interface may include ticket information regarding underground facilities to be detected during a locate operation. As another example using an interface such as the user interface service related information may be input including an identifier for the locate receiver used by the technician an identifier for a technician and or an identifier for the technician s employer. Alternatively some or all of the service related information similarly may be received via the communication interface and likewise some or all of the ticket information may be received via the user interface . As also noted above various image information also may be received via the communication interface .

The actuation system of locate receiver shown in the block diagram of may include both electrical and mechanical elements according to various embodiments and for purposes of illustration is shown in as included as part of the control electronics . The actuation system may include a mechanical and or electrical actuator mechanism e.g. see the actuator shown in to provide one or more signals or stimuli as an input to the actuation system . Upon receiving one or more signals or stimuli e.g. actuation triggering by a locate technician or other user the actuation system may cause the logging of various data constituting locate information. To this end the actuation system may provide one or more output signals in the form of an actuation signal to the processor to indicate one or more actuations of the locate receiver in response to which the processor may acquire collect various locate information and log data into the electronic record .

Location tracking system of locate receiver constitutes another type of input device that provides locate information and may include any device that can determine its geographical location to a certain degree of accuracy. For example location tracking system may include a global positioning system GPS receiver or a global navigation satellite system GNSS receiver. A GPS receiver may provide for example any standard format data stream such as a National Marine Electronics Association NMEA data stream or other data formats. An error correction component may be but is not limited to any mechanism for improving the accuracy of the geographic information provided by location tracking system for example an error correction component may be an algorithm for correcting any offsets e.g. due to local disturbances in the atmosphere in the geo location data of location tracking system . An error correction component may reside at the location tracking system or a remote computing device such as remote computer . In other embodiments location tracking system may include any device or mechanism that may determine location by any other means such as performing triangulation by use of cellular radiotelephone towers.

In one exemplary implementation the location tracking system may include an ISM300F2 05 V0005 GPS module available from Inventek Systems LLC of Westford Mass. see www.inventeksys.com html ism300f2 c5 v0005.html . The Inventek GPS module includes two UARTs universal asynchronous receiver transmitter for communication with the processor supports both the SIRF Binary and NMEA 0183 protocols depending on firmware selection and has an information update rate of 5 Hz. A variety of geographic location information may be requested by the processor and provided by the GPS module to the processor including but not limited to time coordinated universal time UTC date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values and dilution of precision values. Accordingly it should be appreciated that in some implementations the location tracking system may provide a wide variety of geographic information as well as timing information e.g. one or more time stamps to the processor .

In another embodiment location tracking system may not reside locally on locate receiver . Instead location tracking system may reside on any on site computer which serves as a location reference point to which the location of locate receiver may be correlated by any other means such as but not limited to by a triangulation technique between the on site computer and locate receiver .

With respect to other input devices of the locate receiver that may provide locate information the control electronics may also include a timing system having an internal clock not shown such as a crystal oscillator device for processor . Additionally timing system may include a mechanism for registering time with a certain degree of accuracy e.g. accuracy to the minute second or millisecond and may also include a mechanism for registering the calendar date. In various implementations the timing system may be capable of registering the time and date using its internal clock or alternatively timing system may receive its time and date information from the location tracking system e.g. a GPS system or from an external timing system such as a remote computer or network via communication interface . In yet other implementations a dedicated timing system for providing timing information to be logged in an electronic record may be optional and timing information for logging into an electronic record may be obtained from the location tracking system e.g. GPS latitude and longitude coordinates with a corresponding time stamp . Timing information may include but is not limited to a period of time timestamp information date and or elapsed time.

As shown in the locate receiver further includes detection electronics which provides another example of an input device that may provide location information to the processor . In exemplary implementations the detection electronics in turn includes an RF antenna a detection circuit and a processing circuit . Each of these components is explained in greater detail further below.

In one embodiment information provided by one or more input devices of the locate receiver e.g. the timing system the location tracking system the detection electronics the user interface the communication interface is acquired and logged stored in memory upon actuation of the actuation system e.g. triggering an actuator . Some embodiments of the invention may additionally or alternatively acquire log information from one or more input devices at one or more times during or throughout an actuation such as when a technician is holding a mechanical or electrical actuator for some period of time and moving to detect a presence of an underground facility. In various aspects of such embodiments locate information derived from one or more input devices may be collected at a start time of an actuation at one or more times during an actuation and in some cases at regular intervals during an actuation e.g. several times per second once per second once every few seconds . Further some locate information may be collected at an end of an actuation such as time information that may indicate a duration of an actuation.

Additionally it should be appreciated that while some locate information may be received via one or more input devices at the start of each locate operation and upon successive actuations of the locate receiver in other cases some locate information as well as facilities maps information and or other image information may be collected by or provided to the locate receiver prior to a locate operation e.g. on power up or reset of the locate receiver as part of an electronic instruction or dispatch by a locate company and or in response to a request query from a locate technician and stored in local memory for subsequent use by the locate receiver e.g. display of information via the user interface display later incorporation into an electronic record etc. . For example prior to a given locate operation and one or more actuations of the locate receiver one or more of ticket information service related information and image information may have already been received e.g. via the communication interface and or user interface and stored in local memory . Pursuant to a locate operation e.g. immediately before during and or after a locate operation information previously received via the interface s may be retrieved from the local memory if stored there initially and displayed and or entered into an electronic record as appropriate in some case together with information collected pursuant to one or more actuations of the locate receiver. In some implementations ticket information and or service related information may be received via the interface s and stored in an entry in the electronic record directly in response to one or more actuations of the locate receiver e.g. without being first stored in local memory .

In sum according to embodiments of the present invention various locate information from one or more input devices as well as image information regardless of how or when it is received may be displayed in various manners and or stored in memory of the locate receiver e.g. in an electronic record of a locate operation and in some implementations at least some of the locate information may be logged pursuant to one or more actuations of the locate receiver.

In various implementations the optional remote computer of the data acquisition system may be any external computer system with which the locate receiver communicates e.g. via the communications interface . In one embodiment the remote computer may be a centralized computer such as a central server of an underground facility locate service provider. In another embodiment remote computer may be a computer that is at or near the work site i.e. on site e.g. a computer that is present in a locate technician s vehicle. The remote computer may also or alternatively store one or more of the electronic record the locate data algorithm and one or more images.

According to one embodiment the remote computer may form part of a docking station in which a locate device e.g. a locate receiver or locate transmitter may be docked for example when not in use. The docking station may be mechanically and electrically coupled to the locate device. For example the docking station may provide mechanical support via a clip a clamp a strap or other mechanical device for holding the locate device in place. The docking station may also provide electrical interconnection to the locate device via which the power supply of the locate device may be charged and or data may be transferred. Suitable docking stations are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 571 411 filed Sep. 30 2009 and entitled Marking Device Docking Stations and Methods of Using Same which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Docking stations according to the concepts described therein may also be applicable to the locate devices described herein. According to one embodiment a locate receiver may communicate with the docking station via communication interface although other configurations are possible.

Docking events e.g. docking and de docking of a locate receiver may be recorded as event entries for example similar in form to the event entries of Tables 2 5 discussed in detail below. Table 1A illustrates an example of event entry indicating a change in docking status of a locate receiver. Other entry formats are also possible.

Whether resident and or executed on either the locate device or the remote computer as noted above the locate data algorithm includes a set of processor executable instructions e.g. stored in memory such as local memory of the locate device that when executed by processor of the locate device or another processor processes information e.g. various locate information collected in connection with a locate operation. Locate data algorithm when executed by the processor may cause the processor to perform collection logging storage creation of electronic records and in some instances further processing and analysis of various locate information. For example as discussed in further detail below the operations of locate data algorithm as effected by the processor may include but are not limited to the following 

It should also be appreciated that in some embodiments the locate data algorithm may include one or more adjustable parameters that govern various aspects of the collection and logging of locate information e.g. the rate at which various locate information is collected from one or more input devices and that these parameters may be adjusted or set for example by an administrator at a remote computer after which the locate data algorithm is downloaded to the locate device for execution by the processor . Alternatively in other implementations adjustable parameters of a locate data algorithm already resident on a locate device may in some cases be adjusted remotely via the communication interface or locally via the user interface.

While the functionality of various components of the locate receiver was discussed above in connection with shows some structural aspects of the locate receiver according to one embodiment. For example the locate receiver may include an elongated housing in which is disposed one or more elements of the actuation system one or more elements of the control electronics and the power source . Elongated housing may be hollow or may contain certain cavities or molded compartments for installing any components therein such as the various components of locate receiver that are shown in . The elongated housing and other structural elements associated with the housing as discussed below may be formed of any rigid semi rigid strong and lightweight material such as but not limited to molded plastic and aluminum.

Incorporated at a proximal end of elongated housing may be a handle which provides a convenient grip by which the user e.g. the locate technician may carry the locate receiver during use i.e. the exemplary locate receiver depicted in is intended to be a hand held device . In one implementation the power source may be provided in the form of a removable battery pack housing one or more rechargeable batteries that are connected in series or parallel in order to provide a DC voltage to locate receiver and disposed within a compartment in the handle . Such an arrangement facilitates use of conventional removable rechargeable battery packs often employed in a variety of cordless power tools in which the battery pack similarly is situated in a handle of the tool. It should be appreciated however that the power source in the form of a battery pack may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

As also shown in mounted near handle is user interface which may include a display . The display may be a touch screen display to facilitate interaction with a user technician and or the user interface also may include one or more buttons switches joysticks a keyboard and the like to facilitate entry of information by a user technician. One or more elements of the control electronics e.g. the processor memory communication interface and timing system also may be located in the proximal end of the elongated housing in the vicinity of the user interface and display . As with the power source it should be appreciated that one or more elements of the control electronics may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

In the embodiment of the location tracking system similarly may be positioned on the proximal end of the elongated housing to facilitate substantially unobstructed exposure to the atmosphere in particular as illustrated in the location tracking system may be situated on a ground plane providing an electrical ground at least at the antenna frequency of the location tracking system e.g. at approximately 1.5 GHz that extends from the proximal end of the housing and is approximately parallel to the ground surface or pavement when the locate receiver is being normally operated by a technician so as to reduce signal modulation with subtle movements of the locate receiver . As also shown in incorporated at the distal end of elongated housing is the detection electronics including RF antenna .

With respect to the actuation system as shown in the actuation system includes an actuator which for example may be a mechanical mechanism provided at the handle in the form of a trigger that is pulled by a finger or hand of an user technician. In response to the signal stimulus provided by the actuator as discussed above the actuation system may provide an actuation signal to the processor to indicate an actuation. As discussed in further detail below pursuant to the execution by the processor of the locate data algorithm the actuation signal may be used to cause the logging of information that is provided by one or more components of the locate receiver so as to generate an electronic record of the locate operation.

With respect to the general functionality facilitated and or implemented by execution of the locate data algorithm in some embodiments a user may commence a locate operation with the locate receiver by inputting various information to the locate receiver and or selecting various operating options via the user interface. As a non limiting example the user may select from various menu options using the user interface and display as a menu driven GUI and or manually enter via the user interface the type of target object facility to be located the address of the locate operation the ground type e.g. grass pavement etc. whether or not a separate transmitter is being used the mode of the locate receiver e.g. Peak v. Null and active v. passive whether the locate receiver is being operated in landmark mode or not described further below or any other information of interest to a locate operation.

In one exemplary implementation the user may first power on the locate receiver and log on for example by entering a user ID. The user may then navigate through a menu on a touch screen of the user interface to select the target object to be located for example selecting from among a list of options e.g. including facility types such as gas sewer cable and phone etc. . Similarly the user may then navigate through a menu to select the ground type in the area of the locate operation e.g. selecting from a list of options including grass pavement dirt etc. . The user may then similarly select or input the frequency of any applied signal provided by a transmitter in those embodiments in which a transmitter is used for example using a keypad of the user interface or a menu driven GUI. It should be provided that these examples of user actions are non limiting and furthermore that in some embodiments one or more of the pieces of information listed may be detected automatically and not be input selected by the user.

Once the target object facility type and any other relevant or desired information is input and or selected by the technician and the applied signal from the transmitter is coupled to the target object in those embodiments in which the locate receiver is used with a locate transmitter i.e. in active modes of operation as opposed to passive modes in which no transmitter may be used the locate receiver may be used in a variety of manners by the technician for a locate operation in which the technician generally positions e.g. sweeps the locate receiver over an area in which they expect to detect an underground facility. More specifically the technician positions the locate receiver such that the RF antenna which may include more than one antenna as described further below may receive detect a magnetic field emitted by the target object see underground facility in .

In some embodiments the locate receiver is capable of operating in a null mode e.g. capable of detecting a null signal when positioned over an object e.g. facility emitting a magnetic field such that RF antenna may comprise a null detection antenna . Alternatively the locate receiver is capable of operating in a peak detection mode e.g. capable of detecting a peak signal when over an object e.g. facility emitting a magnetic field and the RF antenna comprises two peak detection antennae and which may be positioned substantially parallel to each other but at different positions within the locate receiver e.g. at different heights . In some embodiments the locate receiver is capable of operating in both peak detection and null detection modes and the RF antenna may comprise three antennae e.g. one null detection antenna and two peak detection antennae and as shown in . However RF antenna may comprise any other number type and orientation of antennae as the locate receivers described herein are not limited in these respects.

With reference again to the RF antenna may be coupled to the detection circuit such that the signal s received detected by the RF antenna may be provided to the detection circuit as an output signal of the RF antenna. The output signal of the RF antenna may be any frequency detectable by the antenna and in some embodiments may be between approximately 512 Hz and 1 MHz although these non limiting frequencies are provided primarily for purposes of illustration. As mentioned the output signal of the RF antenna which in some embodiments is an analog signal may be provided to detection circuit which may perform various functions. For example the detection circuit may perform various front end operations on the output signal of RF antenna such as filtering buffering frequency shifting or modulation and or pre amplifying the output signal. Furthermore the detection circuit may perform additional functions such as amplifying and or digitizing the output signal provided by RF antenna . It should be appreciated however that the types of functions described as being performed by detection circuit are non limiting examples and that other functions may additionally or alternatively be performed.

After detection circuit has operated on the signal from RF antenna e.g. by filtering buffering amplifying and or digitizing among other possible operations it may provide a signal to processing circuit . The processing circuit may process the signal s provided by detection circuit in any suitable manner to determine any information of interest. For example according to one embodiment the processing circuit may process the signal s from detection circuit to determine a magnetic field strength of a magnetic field detected by RF antenna . The processing circuit may process the signal s from detection circuit to determine an amplitude and or direction of the electrical current creating the magnetic field s detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit may perform operations to calculate for example the depth and location of the target facility based on the electromagnetic fields detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit may be an analog circuit or a digital microprocessor or any other suitable processing component for performing one or more of the operations described above or any other operations of interest with respect to signals detected by RF antenna . Also it should be appreciated that processing circuit and processor may be a single processor in some embodiments as the illustration of them as distinct in is only one non limiting example.

According to various embodiments the manner in which locate information derived from one or more exemplary input devices is logged to local memory e.g. pursuant to the locate data algorithm may depend at least in part on the type of data being logged as the operation of locate receiver is not limited in this respect. Some general concepts relating to data acquisition are introduced initially below and discussed in greater detail in connection with .

In some exemplary implementations various types of locate information including data from timing system and or location tracking system may be automatically logged continuously e.g. in the form of streaming packets with flag fields as described below or in any other continuous form or periodically to the local memory may be logged in response to one or more types of conditions events e.g. may be logged automatically when a particular condition event occurs and or may be logged at any suitable times. In particular in one implementation logging may occur at periodic intervals during performance of a locate operation such as every second every five seconds every minute or at any other suitable time interval.

According to another embodiment various locate information including timing information and or geographic information from timing system and location tracking system respectively may be logged in response to particular types of events such as detecting an underground facility or detecting the absence of an underground facility. Such events may be identified by signals output by processing circuit to processor . As a non limiting example timing information and or geographic information may be logged when a characteristic e.g. magnetic field strength of a signal detected by RF antenna is greater than a particular threshold value which may be indicated by a signal output from processing circuit to processor and which occurrence may be indicative of the presence of an underground facility. Similarly in some embodiments timing information and or geographic information may be logged when a signal detected by RF antenna has a magnitude above a first threshold and the gain of the locate receiver is above a second threshold. It should be appreciated that various combinations of detected signals detected by locate receiver may be used to trigger logging of information e.g. timing information and or geographic information to local memory. It should also be appreciated that any information available from the location tracking system e.g. any information available in various NMEA data messages such as coordinated universal time date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values dilution of precision values may be included in geographic information constituting all or a portion of logged locate information.

In some embodiments various locate information may be logged in response to detection of a pattern of events or deviation from a pattern of events. For example a pattern of magnetic field strength magnitudes e.g. a relatively constant magnetic field strength for a given time an increasing magnetic field strength a decreasing magnetic field strength etc. may be detected by the locate receiver which may trigger logging of timing information and or geographic information. Deviation from a pattern such as a historical pattern or expected pattern may also trigger logging of information. For example a user s historical use patterns of a locate receiver may be compared to information collected about the use of the locate receiver during a given job and if a deviation is detected then logging of timing and or geographic information may be triggered. The patterns or deviations from patterns may relate to patterns in magnetic field strength magnetic field frequency signal gain user operation any other information described herein or any combination of such information.

In some embodiments alternatively or in addition to automatic logging of locate information based on some condition or event a user of the locate receiver may manually trigger logging of timing information geographic information and or any other data associated with a locate operation or locate receiver locate information for example by manipulating a control e.g. button knob joystick of the user interface or as discussed above by actuating an actuator integrated or otherwise associated with the locate receiver as shown in which may be part of the actuation system and which may cause a signal to be sent to the processor to initiate logging of locate information. For example according to some embodiments a user may initiate the locate receiver taking a depth measurement by depressing a pushbutton of the user interface or pulling squeezing the actuator which may also trigger the logging of timing information and or geographic information from timing system and location tracking system . The depth measurement data time data and or location data may then be logged in an electronic record in local memory .

It should be appreciated that while the foregoing discussion focuses on logging locate information to local memory the locate information may also or alternatively be transmitted to remote computer via communication interface . As with logging locate information to local memory the transmission of locate information to remote computer may be performed continuously periodically in response to one or more types of events in response to user input or actuation of an actuator or in any other suitable manner.

In yet other embodiments the locate receiver may be configured e.g. via particular instructions executing on the processor to operate in multiple different modes to collect various information relating not only to a locate operation locate information but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig areas in which the locate operation is performed. For example in one implementation the locate receiver may be configured to operate in a first locate mode which essentially follows various aspects of the operation of the locate receiver described herein and also may be configured to operate in a second landmark identification mode. When switched into the landmark mode the locate receiver may stop detecting a magnetic field e.g. the RF antenna of the locate receiver may be temporarily disabled in some embodiments. In other embodiments the locate receiver may continue to operate and the landmark mode may represent additional functionality added to the locate receiver functionality. Additional details of the landmark mode are discussed further below.

As noted above locate information may be generated logged and or transmitted by a locate device according to a variety of manual semi automatic and or automatic techniques for example in some implementations a technician may actuate an actuator e.g. pull a trigger push a button in response to which certain locate information may be generated acquired logged and or transmitted. In other implementations one or more predetermined conditions may be established e.g. one or more thresholds patterns etc. that when present may cause generation acquisition logging and or transmission of locate information.

In exemplary methods for generating an electronic record of locate operations according to some embodiments of the invention pursuant to manual actuation of an actuator or manipulation of a user interface control mechanism as discussed in greater detail below for a given actuation the processor may generate an actuation data set e.g. a set of data that is somehow organized formatted and or indexed to correspond to a given actuation of the locate receiver. For example for a given actuation data set the processor may request the location tracking system to provide geographic information at one or more times during the actuation e.g. periodically at regular intervals . Thus an actuation data set of an electronic record for a given actuation of the locate receiver may have multiple pieces of geographic information and associated time stamps representing the location of the locate receiver at multiple times during a corresponding actuation. Additionally for a given actuation the processor also may request the processing circuit to provide various locate signal information e.g. relating to one or more characteristics of the detected magnetic field as part of the actuation data set. The processor also may include in the actuation data set ticket information and service related information which may be collected e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface before a corresponding actuation stored in memory and retrieved from the memory for entry into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation or collected and entered into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation.

While the collection and logging of locate information to generate an electronic record is discussed in some aspects for purposes of illustration in terms of actuation data sets i.e. a set of data that is associated and logged with a corresponding actuation of the locate receiver it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. More generally an electronic record of a locate operation may be generated in any of a variety of manners have a variety of file formats and or data structures and include any of a variety of locate information.

In block of the process shown in ticket information and or service related information may be received e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface of locate receiver and this information optionally may be stored in whole or in part in local memory of the locate receiver. The ticket information and or service related information may be received electronically in any of a variety of formats and the processor may be configured to appropriately parse the information for subsequent entry into an electronic record.

For example in some embodiments the ticket information may be received as part of an electronic locate request ticket and individual respective pieces of ticket information e.g. ticket number work site address information requesting party etc. may be extracted or derived from the electronic locate request ticket. In other embodiments various aspects of ticket information may be input by a user technician via the user interface.

For example in block the process may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion in an electronic record and or selection by a user technician e.g. via the user interface of various information to be included in an electronic record as part of ticket information and or service related information . One example of such information may relate to a ground type in and around the work site dig area at which the locate operation is taking place. In some implementations a text description of the ground type may be entered and stored as part of the electronic record. In another exemplary implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a ground type selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of ground types displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of ground type categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Pavement 2 Grass 3 Rough Rocky 4 Dirt 5 Gravel Sand and 6 Other. More generally any number and variety of ground type categories may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example. In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that a ground type category may be accomplished via voice activated commands by simply speaking into the microphone.

Similarly with respect to service related information a user technician may manually enter some aspects of this information via the user interface display while other aspects may already be available in other memory locations e.g. the locate receiver ID or serial number a technician ID to which the locate receiver is assigned or checked out etc. and or may be received electronically.

While block is illustrated as one element of the process it should be appreciated that respective pieces of information received as input in block may be received at different times and via different interfaces sources and thus may occur at different points in the process . It should also be appreciated that block is an optional step in the process and that more generally a process for collecting locate information to generate an electronic record need not necessarily include collection of one or both of ticket information and service related information.

In block the locate technician utilizes the user interface to indicate the initiation of a locate operation. For example the technician may press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to commence a locate operation. In response a job initiation signal is provided to the processor e.g. via a switch closure and a ground or DC level applied to an I O pin of the processor or by the user interface providing a signal to the processor to initiate generation of an electronic record. Alternatively a remote job initiation signal may be received by the processor via the communication interface from another device such as the remote computer .

In response to the job initiation signal in block the processor opens a file in the memory in which to store the electronic record and assigns a file identifier to the opened file. In one example the file identifier assigned to the opened file may be or include one or more of a job number job ID or ticket number derived from the ticket information and or the service related information an identifier for the locate receiver itself and an identifier for a remote computer associated with the locate receiver e.g. for either remote control operation of the device and or data uploading downloading . To this end if ticket information and or service related information is not previously available e.g. if no information is received in block the technician optionally may be prompted to manually enter e.g. via a wizard or sequence of dialogues germane to obtaining relevant information displayed on the display of the user interface various elements of ticket information and or service related information from which a file identifier may be derived or provide other information that may be used as a file identifier.

A file opened in block for purposes of storing an electronic record may have any of a variety of formats and include any of a variety of data structures. In one embodiment the processor initially opens up a flat file for collection and logging of locate information to facilitate generation of an electronic record. As known in the art a flat file is a plain text or mixed text binary file containing one entry data record per line in which each entry may have multiple fields containing respective values and wherein the respective values may be separated by delimiters e.g. commas or have a fixed length. In one exemplary implementation the processor logs data into a flat file opened for the electronic record as a succession of time stamped event entries. Some event entries may be related specifically to actuation and or logged in response to actuation of the locate receiver e.g. the processor receiving an actuation signal while other event entries may be related to automatic logging of data as discussed above e.g. upon meeting or exceeding a threshold condition meeting or deviating from a pattern etc. . Other event entries may be more generally related in some manner to overall operation of the locate receiver or the locate operation itself but not necessarily associated with one or more particular actuations e.g. start pause stop locate operation power battery status communication link network connection status etc. and these other event entries may be logged at virtually any time in some cases irrespective of one or more actuations .

Accordingly it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this embodiment a flat file for an electronic record may contain a succession of time stamped event entries on respective lines in which one or more event entries may have multiple delimited fields values and wherein at least some of the event entries may relate to actuation of the locate receiver and or automatic logging of data. In another aspect one or more fields values in a given event entry may specifically indicate in some manner whether or not the event is associated with an actuation of the locate receiver. In general an actuation event entry constitutes an entry in a file for an electronic record that is in some manner specifically related to and or logged in response to or during actuation of the locate receiver and multiple actuation event entries for a given actuation constitute an actuation data set for that actuation. Again it should be appreciated that a file for an electronic record may include one or more other event entries that may not be particularly associated with an actuation.

In other embodiments the file for an electronic record may or may not be a flat file and event entries associated with actuations actuation event entries may be somehow identified and differentiated from other event entries that are not associated with an actuation. For example a file for an electronic record may include a particular data structure or format that segregates or separates in some manner event entries associated with successive actuations from those event entries that are not particularly associated with actuations and or may be common to multiple actuations or a group of actuations . In yet other embodiments as discussed below locate information may be initially collected and logged in a first file for an electronic record in a first format e.g. a flat file including a succession of time stamped event entries as raw data for the locate operation that may be stored and or transmitted for any of a variety of purposes and then reformatted and or reorganized in some manner in one or more subsequent files e.g. a file having a particular data structure that segregates separates actuation related information from other information in different fields elements of a data structure for archiving and or transmission to one or more other devices processors.

Once a file for an electronic record is opened in block in block the processor can begin collecting and logging various locate information i.e. logging in the electronic record and or transmitting via the communication interface actuation event entries and or other event entries. In one exemplary implementation the processor may be programmed so as to poll one or more input devices and or other components of the locate receiver to receive information either once or multiple times periodically following the job initiation signal and log responses to these polls polling events as event entries with associated time stamps. Examples of entries corresponding to polling events that may be logged into the file for the electronic record and or transmitted include but are not limited to one or more power status event entries including power information associated with the power source one or more ticket information event entries including ticket information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. one or more service related information event entries including the service related information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. and one or more communication interface event entries including status information regarding operation of the communication interface e.g. network communication available unavailable .

Additionally or alternatively the processor may be programmed so as to respond to one or more signals designated as interrupt events from one or more components of the locate receiver. Such interrupt events cause logging of information in the electronic record and or transmission of information upon following the processor detecting the corresponding signal s . For example the job initiation signal itself may constitute an interrupt event in response to which the processor not only opens a file for the electronic record but once the file is opened the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into the electronic record a start job event entry including a job initiation time stamp associated with receipt of the job initiation signal.

In a similar manner following commencement of a locate operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to pause restart and or indicate completion of the locate operation and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of a pause signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a pause job event entry including a pause job time stamp associated with the at least one pause signal. When the technician is ready to continue as shown in block of the technician may indicate this via the user interface and a restart job event entry similarly may be logged. When the locate operation is deemed by the technician to be completed as noted in block of the technician may utilize the user interface so as to provide a stop signal to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a stop job event entry including a stop job time stamp associated with the stop signal.

Additionally the locate technician may utilize the user interface to denote the beginning and end of a locate operation for a particular facility type and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example upon beginning a locate operation for a given facility type the technician may select line start from the user interface and a corresponding line start signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line start event entry. Similarly when the technician wishes to indicate completion of the locate operation for a given facility type the technician may select line stop from the user interface and a corresponding line stop signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line stop even entry. 

While various events are noted above as examples of polling events as opposed to interrupt events it should be appreciated that the inventive concepts discussed herein are not limited in these respects and that the locate data algorithm executed by the processor may be configured in any of a variety manners to designate various functions performed by and or information provided by various components of the locate receiver as polling events or interrupt events. For example the power source may be configured to provide a low battery signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that may be logged by the processor and or that may cause the processor to take some particular action e.g. provide an audible visible alert disable logging of further data etc. . In one aspect absent the low battery signal the processor may request status information from the power source once or occasionally as a polling event. Similarly the communication interface may be configured to provide a no network connection available signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that is logged and or causes the processor to take some action and when not present the processor may poll the communication interface to request status information as a polling event.

Another example of an interrupt event is the automatic logging of locate information for example one or more of timing information geographic information and locate signal information derived from the detection electronics . In particular as discussed above automatic logging may occur at periodic intervals during performance of a locate operation such as every second every five seconds every minute or at any other suitable time interval. Alternatively timing information geographic information and or locate signal information may be logged when a characteristic e.g. magnetic field strength of a signal detected by RF antenna is greater than a particular threshold value which may be indicated by a signal output from processing circuit to processor and which occurrence may be indicative of the presence of an underground facility. Similarly in some embodiments timing information geographic information and or locate signal information may be logged when a signal detected by RF antenna has a magnitude above a first threshold and the gain of the locate receiver is above a second threshold. Additionally as noted above various locate information may be logged in response to detection of a pattern of conditions events or deviation from a pattern of conditions events e.g. a pattern of magnetic field strength magnitudes may be detected by the detection electronics which may cause automatic logging of timing information geographic information and or locate signal information .

Yet another example of an interrupt event is given by the actuation signal provided by the actuation system upon actuation of the actuator i.e. a signal change of state indicating a transition from a non actuated state to an actuated state in response to which the processor logs one or more actuation event entries in the electronic record. More specifically in one implementation the receipt of a non actuated to actuated transition state of the actuation signal by the processor may cause an initial actuation event entry to be logged as a start actuation event entry having an associated time stamp i.e. a start time for the corresponding actuation and also cause the processor to subsequently poll one or more input devices for information during the corresponding actuation and until release of the actuator i.e. subsequent change of state of the actuation signal . In this manner an actuation data set for a given actuation may include multiple actuation event entries.

For example during actuation of the actuator the processor may poll the location tracking system so as to receive geographic information and in turn log one or more geo location data event entries in the actuation data set for the corresponding actuation. As discussed above in connection with in one exemplary implementation the location tracking system is configured to provide geographic information at an information update rate of approximately 5 Hz and the processor may log respective updates of geographic information provided by the location tracking system at this update rate during an actuation as multiple geo location data event entries of the actuation data set. It should be appreciated however that methods and apparatus according to various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect and that other geographic information update rates may be employed in various implementations e.g. update rates of up to approximately 100 Hz based in part on the particular location tracking system employed. Furthermore it should be appreciated that in some implementations the geographic information provided by the location tracking system may include one or more longitude coordinates latitude coordinates and a corresponding geo location data time stamp at which a given set of longitude latitude coordinates are obtained by the location tracking system accordingly a given geo location data event entry in an actuation data set may include a longitude coordinate a latitude coordinate and the corresponding geo location data time stamp.

Similarly in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the timing system and the detection electronics so as to receive timing information and or locate signal information during a corresponding actuation and in turn log one or more of a timing event entry and a locate signal event entry as part of the actuation data set. Any of a variety of locate signal information as discussed above may be collected and logged during actuation in response to processor polling of the detection electronics .

Additionally in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the user interface the communication interface and the local memory to retrieve ticket information and or service related information for logging into an actuation data set. As discussed above in some implementations the receipt retrieval of ticket information and or service related information may be treated as a polling event not necessarily associated with actuations and this information need not be included in one or more actuation data sets. However in other implementations it may be desirable to include at least some aspect of ticket information and or service related information in each actuation data set notwithstanding the possible redundancy of data content in respective actuation data sets.

Another example of an interrupt event is given by a change of state of the actuation signal indicating a transition from the actuated state to the non actuated state i.e. release of the actuator . In response to this event the processor may request information from the timing system and log an end actuation event entry including an end time stamp.

In yet another embodiment the processor executing locate data algorithm may be configured to repeatedly regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the locate receiver e.g. in a predetermined order in response to receipt of the job initiation signal as well as continually monitor for a variety of possible interrupt events and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including locate information received pursuant to these polling and or interrupt events. In one aspect of this embodiment each data packet of locate information may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. For example in one implementation the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID e.g. ticket identifier technician ID device ID e.g. serial number packet type ID and or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device s or devices generating interrupts and one or more flag fields that are set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator automatic log due to some condition event low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator or automatic logging of data tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the locate receiver in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Table 1 below illustrates an example of a portion of the contents of a relatively simple flat file for an electronic record that may be generated by the process of 

The portion of the file shown in Table 1 corresponds to multiple locate signal event entries indicating detection of a facility one entry per line . Each entry has a time stamp e.g. entries are logged at a rate of approximately five events per second and further includes multiple fields having respective values e.g. as comma separated values for latitude and longitude coordinates received from the location tracking device an event indicator indicating that the locate receiver is detecting Detection and a color code indicating the type of facility detected e.g. as established by the American Public Works Association and shown further below in Table 7 .

As noted above it should be appreciated that the portion of the file shown in Table 1 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that the format and or content for respective event entries and the file itself for an electronic record generated by and or based on the information collection process discussed above in connection with may have any of a variety of different formats and or content.

To this point Tables 2 through 5 below provide examples of various events for which event entries may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the locate receiver exemplary formats for these event entries and exemplary file formats for files having multiple such entries according to another embodiment of the present invention.

This event entry format provides information about when a locate operation job is started and completed in addition to capturing details about if and when the job was paused and restarted.

As has been described according to at least one embodiment of the present invention a locate receiver may be operated to collect and or transmit locate information upon actuation by a user. Table 3 illustrates an example of an entry relating to the actuation event. Locate information from one or more input devices other components of the locate device may be recorded upon actuation to provide information about the job in progress. The facility type information may be entered selected by a user as described previously and may be recorded in the event for example according to the color coding scheme of Table 7 discussed further below.

The status event of a locate device collects various locate related information and or information on operating characteristics of the locate device on a periodic basis while a job is in progress e.g. pursuant to processor polls . An example is shown below in Table 4. In the non limiting example the entries include information about the mode of the locate receiver e.g. peak v. null . It should be appreciated however that other information may additionally or alternatively be included in the event entry.

Should any input device or other component of the locate device encounter a significant error condition this may be logged as an event. In some cases the user technician also may be notified of the error through the user interface visible alert on display audible alarm alert etc. . Similar event formats may be adopted for warning alerts events and informational alerts events.

It should be appreciated that the event types described above and the logged location information shown in the corresponding tables are provided primarily for purposes of illustration and are not limiting. Thus events of various other types and with various other information may be logged into an electronic record.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including the event entries outlined above in Tables 2 through 5 two exemplary file formats namely ASCII and XML are provided below for purposes of illustration. In various implementations a given locate receiver may be particularly configured to store and or transmit electronic records and respective entries therein in either format or other formats . With respect to identification of files electronic records a standard naming scheme format may be adopted for example including an identifier for the remote computer with which the locate receiver may be communicating ServerID an identifier for the locate receiver itself LocRecID and an identifier for the locate operation job JobID and having the format ServerID LocRecID Job ID. 

This format allows low level remote processing engines to quickly and easily receive parse and react to locate information logged and or transmitted by the locate receiver. An example of an electronic record formatted in ASCII based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

This format allows transmission of self describing data elements from the locate receiver in some instances reducing processing errors and reducing the risks and effort involved in upgrades and data changes. An example of an electronic record formatted in XML based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

Table 6 shown below lists another example of the contents of an electronic record of locate information that may be generated and stored and or transmitted relating to operation of a locate receiver according to one non limiting embodiment. The electronic record shown in Table 6 includes a record number record 1001 an identification of the service provider an identification of the user i.e. the locate technician operating the locate receiver and an identification of the locate receiver. The mode of operation of the locate receiver e.g. peak and in some scenarios an indication of active or passive operation may also be included. Timing information timestamp data from a timing system of the locate receiver and geographic information from a location tracking system of the locate receiver may also be included. The signal strength and signal frequency entries of the electronic record indicate characteristics of a signal e.g. a magnetic field detected by the locate receiver for example emitted from an underground facility. The signal strength is listed in the example of Table 6 as a percentage of the maximum detectable by the locate receiver although it should be appreciated that other units of measurement may alternatively be used. The gain entry indicates the gain setting of the locate receiver. The electronic record also includes an entry for the depth of the facility targeted as may be determined by taking a depth measurement using a locate receiver e.g. by calculating a difference in magnetic field strength detected by two different antennae at two different locations within a locate receiver and for the facility type e.g. gas electric etc. and ground type in the area of the locate operation. The electronic record of Table 6 also includes the address of the locate operation and the party requesting the locate operation. Lastly Table 6 includes information about the remaining battery life of the locate receiver for those embodiments that include a battery.

It should be appreciated that Table 6 represents only one non limiting example of an electronic record of locate information which may be generated in accordance with the operation of a locate receiver according to one embodiment. In particular a single electronic record of locate information collected in connection with operation of a locate receiver may include multiple entries of a given data type. For example while Table 6 illustrates an electronic record including a single GPS data point it should be appreciated that multiple GPS data points may be taken and stored within a single electronic record. The multiple GPS data points may be taken in response to a single actuation event e.g. single actuator pull by a technician in response to multiple actuation events e.g. multiple actuator pulls by a technician or in other manners. Thus multiple pieces of data may be collected for an electronic record of a locate operation and it should be appreciated that any single electronic record may include multiple entries.

With regard to color information that may be included in any of the event entries and electronic records discussed herein Table 7 below shows an example of a color code used to identify facilities to be detected during a locate operation.

As shown in the record includes a file identifier e.g. one or more of Job ID LocRecID ServerID etc. and a plurality of actuation data sets through N with reference numbers A B C . . . N wherein each actuation data set is associated with a corresponding actuation of a locate receiver. For purposes of the following discussion shows additional details of the data structure for actuation data set C showing several fields in which data e.g. actuation event entries may be entered to constitute the actuation data set. While only the exemplary details of the data structure of actuation data set are shown in the electronic record of it should be appreciated that multiple actuation data sets of the electronic record may have the same data structure as that shown for actuation data set in .

The data structure of the actuation data set C of the electronic record shown in includes a start location field corresponding to geo location data shown in Table 2 when an actuator is pressed an end location field corresponding to geo location data shown in Table 2 when an actuator is released a start time field corresponding to timestamp data shown in Table 2 when an actuator is pressed an end time field corresponding to timestamp data shown in Table 2 when an actuator is released and a duration field corresponding to the duration of the actuator being held . Additionally the data structure for entry C includes one or more fields A B . . . N for intermediate location data e.g. corresponding to 1interval location data 2interval location data . . . Nth interval location data which may be acquired while the actuator is being held . The actuation data set also may include a locate signal information field including various data relating to one or more signals e.g. corresponding to signal strength gain frequency as shown in Table 6 . Finally the data structure for the entry C may include one or more ticket information fields e.g. corresponding to Locate request data in Table 6 and one or more service related information fields e.g. corresponding to Service provider ID User ID and Receiver ID in Table 6 .

In addition to one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations of a locate receiver the electronic record shown in may include one or more additional elements. For example shows an additional element of the electronic record to store the total number of entries in the record. Furthermore according to another embodiment various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves. For example in one alternative implementation one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the locate signal information field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are not included within any one actuation data set e.g. the information contained in one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the locate signal information field may be common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

In yet another embodiment of the present invention a locate device such as the locate receiver shown in as well as a locate transmitter may be configured e.g. via particular instructions included in the locate data algorithm executing on the processor and or various hardware modifications to operate in multiple different modes so as to collect various information relating not only to a locate operation itself locate information but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig area in which the locate operation is performed. For example in one implementation the locate receiver may be configured to operate in a first locate mode which essentially follows various aspects of the process outlined in and also operate in a second landmark identification mode or more simply landmark mode in which the locate receiver acquires information relating to one or more environmental landmarks that may be germane to the locate operation e.g. in and around the work site dig area and or generally in the vicinity of the locate operation .

More specifically in a locate mode various locate information may be collected logged stored and or transmitted as discussed above in connection with the detection of a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities. Alternatively in a landmark mode a technician positions the locate receiver proximate to an environmental landmark of interest and upon actuation of the locate receiver e.g. via an actuator or manipulation of a user interface control mechanism the locate receiver collects various information about the landmark hereafter referred to as landmark information which information may include but is not limited to geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark and a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark.

With respect to mode selection the locate receiver may be configured e.g. via execution of the locate data algorithm to provide for mode selection in any of a number of manners. For example in one implementation the locate receiver may be equipped with a simple switch referred to as a mode selection switch which in some instances may form part of the user interface . The switch may include an open contact state and a closed contact state wherein one contact is electrically coupled to a power signal or to ground and another contact is electrically coupled to an input of the processor in this manner when the switch is toggled a mode signal may be provided to the processor as an interrupt event to indicate landmark mode. In response to the mode signal indicating landmark mode the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into an electronic record a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the locate data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode such as providing for the selection of landmark categories and or types via the user interface and menus provided on the display and logging actuation event entries in an electronic record as landmark event entries. 

Again as noted above such a mode selection switch may be provided by the user interface for example in the form of a button switch portion of the touch screen display microphone to provide for voice activation etc. Apart from a hardware switch the user interface alternatively may be employed for mode selection between locate mode and landmark mode in particular the user interface and or display may implement a menu driven GUI to provide for mode selection.

In the process outlined in following commencement of a locate operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface speak into a microphone to provide a voice activated command etc. to not only pause restart and or indicate completion of the locate operation but further to select a landmark mode of operation for the locate receiver. As noted above in the discussion of any one or more of these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of if a technician selects landmark mode via the user interface the user interface may provide a landmark mode signal to the processor. In response to this signal the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the locate data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode as discussed above the landmark mode may be entered in alternative implementations via a mode signal provided to the processor by a dedicated mode selector switch.

Table 8 below provides an example of content and format for a mode select event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the locate receiver. The example mode select event entry shown below in Table 8 follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the process outlined in subsequent to selection of the landmark mode as noted in block the process may provide for the selection of a particular category and or type of landmark for which information is to be collected. To this end in one implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a landmark selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of landmarks displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of landmark categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Natural Gas 2 Water Sewer 3 Power Line 4 Phone Line 5 CATV Line and 6 Other. 

Upon selection via the user interface of one of the landmark categories displayed on the submenu the processor may control the user interface so as to display yet another submenu indicating various types of landmarks that fall within the selected category so as to facilitate selection of a particular type of landmark for which information is to be collected. Examples of types of landmarks that may be displayed and available for selection via the user interface for each of the above identified categories include but are not limited to 

While the foregoing discussion of landmark categories and types provides one construct in which a wide variety of landmarks are made available for selection by the technician it should be appreciated that in other implementations options for landmark selection may be presented in different manners. For example a more succinct list of landmark types may be presented to the technician to facilitate easy selection e.g. a more limited set of about a dozen more common landmark types that might be encountered in the field such as telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. . More generally any number and variety of landmark types may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example.

In another exemplary implementation the categories and or types of landmarks made available for selection via the user interface may be based at least in part on a type of facility being located when the locate receiver was in a locate mode prior to selection of the landmark mode. For example consider a technician using the locate receiver in the locate mode and in the process of locating a power line. In one implementation upon switching to landmark mode the user is first presented with selection options for landmark category and or type that are more closely related to a power line e.g. a more limited subset of option types including pole transformer pedestal etc. . In one aspect the technician may nonetheless still have the option to select other categories and or types of landmarks but as a default the technician is first presented with options related to the type of facility last being located. In another aspect the selection options for landmark category and or type may be specifically and intentionally limited to those options that are most germane to the type of facility last being located in the previous locate mode i.e. immediately prior to entry into the landmark mode .

In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that landmark category and or type selection may be accomplished via voice activated commands. For example once landmark mode is selected the technician may select a particular landmark category or type by simply speaking into the microphone e.g. telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. .

In addition to or as an alternative to selection of landmark category and or type block may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion as part of the landmark information in an electronic record. For example in some exemplary implementations via the user interface and or display the technician may enter text based information relating to an environmental landmark e.g. as an offset to another topological architectural or infrastructure feature in proximity to the environmental landmark telephone pole 5 ft. from back of curb . Additionally in a manner similar to landmark type selection the user interface display may provide for menu driven selection via a GUI of predetermined options for additional text based information to be included as part of the landmark information e.g. a set of stock text messages for selection to be included as part of landmark information .

Following selection of landmark category and or type and or entry section of any text based information in block of the process shown in in block actuations of the actuator in landmark mode cause the processor to collect various landmark information with each actuation which information is logged in an electronic record as a landmark event entry rather than an actuation event entry as noted in Table 3 above . Essentially in landmark mode the technician positions the locate receiver proximate to a selected category type of landmark and actuates the actuator or manipulates a designated user interface control mechanism to acquire various information relating to the landmark e.g. geo location data type time stamp .

In general the processor may be configured to communicate with e.g. poll any of a variety of input devices to collect landmark information to be logged in an electronic record. As discussed above in connection with the locate mode refer again to such information may be acquired from any of a variety of input devices including but not limited to the location tracking system the timing system the communications interface e.g. a USB port or other port the user interface and the local memory .

In particular any data that is available from the location tracking system e.g. any information available in various NMEA data messages such as coordinated universal time date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values dilution of precision values may be collected as landmark information and logged in an electronic record as part of a landmark event entry. Additionally information collected from the user interface in the form of a text entry by the technician may be included in a landmark event entry for example in one implementation upon actuation of the actuator the processor may prompt the technician via the display of the user interface to enter text notes if desired e.g. the technician may describe an offset of a target environmental landmark from an architectural topographical or infrastructure feature to compliment geographic information provided by the location tracking system and this textual information may serve as landmark information. In view of the foregoing it should be appreciated that landmark information may include a wide variety of information components including but not limited to one or more of geographical information e.g. from the location tracking system timing information e.g. from the location tracking system and or the timing system landmark category and or type information e.g. selected or entered via the user interface textual information e.g. entered via the user interface or other information e.g. received from the local memory and or the communications interface .

Table 9 below provides an example of content and format for a landmark event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the locate receiver when in landmark mode. The example landmark event entry shown below in Table 9 also follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the example landmark event entry given in Table 9 the landmark information includes a time stamp e.g. DATE and TIME geographical information e.g. GPS data category type information and text based information for an environmental landmark. The notation LMRK 3 12 in the example denotes a category 3 type 12 landmark which in the exemplary listings provided above corresponds to Power Line Circuit Breaker. It should be appreciated that the event entry shown in Table 9 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that a variety of other or additional landmark information may be included in landmark event entries as noted above.

As with the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above the exemplary format for a mode select and landmark event entry as shown in Tables 8 and 9 may be included in either an ASCII and XML file format for an electronic record that is stored and or transmitted by the locate receiver in which a particular naming scheme format may be adopted to identify files electronic records such as ServerID LocRecID Job ID . It should also be appreciated that an electronic record generated by a multi mode locate receiver in some instances may include a mixture of actuation event entries and landmark event entries actuation event entries without any landmark event entries and landmark event entries without any actuation event entries.

Yet another alternative format for storing and organizing landmark information in an electronic record according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in Tables 10 and 11 below. By way of example Table 10 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a utility pole which includes one geo location data point and Table 11 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a pedestal which includes four geo location data points i.e. one for each corner of the pedestal . It should be appreciated that the format and content shown below in Tables 10 and 11 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and as noted above a variety of format and content may be included in an electronic record entry for landmark information. The examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 may constitute an original electronic record generated by the processor pursuant to the process shown in or may be derived from raw data collected and logged pursuant to the process e.g. as a flat file an ASCII formatted file or an XML formatted file and subsequently reorganized and particularly formatted. It should also be appreciated that the examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 illustrate that landmark information may be included in an electronic record together with one or both of ticket information and service related information as discussed above in connection with electronic records including various locate information.

In other respects the data structure in is similar to that shown in . For example various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves e.g. one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the locate signal information field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

Once an actuation of the locate receiver in landmark mode has been logged as a landmark event entry the process shown in returns to block . At this point the technician is provided via the user interface display with the options of pausing the job block restarting the job if previously paused block stopping the job and indicating completion block or selecting landmark mode again block for the next actuation. If the technician selects none of these options the process returns to block at which point further polling and or interrupt events are logged as discussed above in connection with . Accordingly after an actuation in landmark mode in one exemplary implementation the locate receiver defaults back to the locate mode unless and until the technician selects the landmark mode again for a subsequent actuation.

In an alternative implementation not shown in following actuation of the locate receiver in landmark mode the processor may control the user interface display to provide an option to the technician to exit landmark mode rather than automatically presenting the options of pause job restart job stop job or landmark mode . In this manner the locate receiver remains in landmark mode for subsequent actuations until the technician makes a menu selection to exit landmark mode at which point the process returns to block .

In yet another embodiment the processor executing locate data algorithm in landmark mode may be configured to generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets representing various event entries logged by the locate receiver e.g. as shown above in Tables 2 9 . As discussed above in connection with the locate mode each data packet may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. To accommodate both a locate mode and a landmark mode one flag field may be set or reset upon selection of the landmark mode so as to identify the contents of any information payload field in the data packet as landmark information as opposed to locate information. Similarly as discussed above one or more other flag fields may be set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator automatic logging of data low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag and certain data packets also may be tagged as generated in locate mode or landmark mode. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the locate receiver in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Thus in landmark identification mode a locate technician may employ an appropriately configured locate receiver to capture the types and locations of environmental landmarks of interest that are present at the work site and or in the general environs of a dig area. While in landmark mode the locate technician may approach a certain environmental landmark then select the type of the environmental landmark via user interface position the locate receiver e.g. place the tip of locate receiver proximate to the target environmental landmark and then actuate the locate receiver. In doing so the locate receiver logs in an electronic record landmark information including for example the type of the target environmental landmark the geo location of the target environmental landmark and a time stamp in an electronic record. The locate technician may move from one environmental landmark to the next until information about all environmental landmarks of interest has been captured. Additionally one or more data points e.g. landmark event entries may be captured for any given environmental landmark.

V. Computer Generated Visual Representation of a Locate Operation Including Locate Information and Landmark Information

With reference again to in yet another embodiment the processor executing locate data algorithm and or one or more remote computers executing locate data algorithm may additionally process various locate information and or landmark information provided in real time from a locate receiver and or stored in an electronic record of locate operation and control a display device e.g. display of locate receiver or some other display device to render a computer generated visual representation of one or both of the locate information and landmark information. Such a visual representation may be used for example to provide immediate feedback to the locate technician provide essentially real time feedback to a supervisor monitoring the technician from a remote location provide a visual record of the locate information and or the landmark information e.g. for archiving purposes once one or more electronic records are generated and or to verify the quality e.g. accuracy and completeness of work performed during a locate and marking operation. For purposes of the following discussion a locate operation may refer to one or both of the processes of collecting locate information and landmark information. Accordingly it should be appreciated that in various exemplary implementations of a computer generated visual representation only locate information may be visually rendered only landmark information may be visually rendered or both locate information and landmark information may be visually rendered.

In various aspects of this embodiment a visual representation may be static in that all available locate information and or landmark information is presented in a display field at one time after generation of an electronic record alternatively the visual representation may be dynamic in that locate information and or landmark information is displayed in essentially real time as it is collected or may be displayed after generation of the electronic record in a time sequenced animation that recreates the collection of information on the time scale in which it was originally acquired e.g. based on the time stamps indicating when the information was acquired .

In other aspects the relative positions of one or more detected facilities as represented by actuation event entries and or interrupt event entries e.g. representing automatically logged locate information logged and or transmitted by the locate receiver as well as the relative positions of all environmental landmarks represented by landmark event entries logged and or transmitted by the locate receiver may be displayed e.g. based on geo location data and some appropriate scale of an available display field of display to provide a visual representation of the locate operation. A visual representation of a locate operation may also be rendered in one or more particular colors corresponding to one or more particular underground facilities detected during the locate operation e.g. see Table 7 .

In one exemplary implementation such a visual representation may include one electronic detection mark displayed in a display field for each actuation of a locate receiver. Alternatively in another exemplary implementation of such a visual representation an essentially continuous solid line or other line type may be displayed in a display field to represent a given underground facility detected during a locate operation. In another aspect the processor may process the geo location data in respective actuation data sets of an electronic record so as to filter average interpolate and or otherwise smooth data e.g. so as to provide cleaner visual renderings and or connect successive electronic detection marks represented by the respective actuation data sets of the electronic record alternatively raw data provided by the locate receiver may be utilized for the visual representation. In yet another aspect of this embodiment visual representations of multiple locate operations for different underground facilities within the same work site dig area may be generated in the same display field of a display device so as to provide a composite visual representation in which different underground facilities may be uniquely identified in some manner e.g. by different line types and or different colors and one or more environmental landmarks in and or around the work site dig area may be identified using a variety of displayed identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. .

In block of the process if an electronic record has already been generated for the locate operation in which one or more underground facilities are detected and or environmental landmark information is acquired the record is examined to determine the geographic extents of the electronic detection marks and or environmental landmarks to be visually rendered on a display device. In particular the processor may review the geo location data of all elements actuation data sets of the electronic record to determine e.g. based on the respective latitude and longitude coordinates of the available geo location data the maximum extents of the locate operation to be visually rendered.

The maximum extents of the locate operation may be determined in any of a variety of manners according to different exemplary implementations. For example in one exemplary implementation in block the processor may determine the centroid of all electronic detection marks and or environmental landmarks represented by the data of the electronic record to be displayed. The processor then determines the geographic extent of the collection of electronic detection marks and or environmental landmarks by determining one or more latitude longitude coordinate pairs from the available data having a greatest distance from the centroid. In one example the processor may determine a single farthest point from the centroid and a distance between this farthest point and the centroid serves as a radius of a circle that provides an extents area circle. In another example the farthest opposing corners of a rectangle around the centroid may be determined by assigning the centroid as the origin of a reference coordinate system and finding the coordinate pairs in opposing quadrants of the coordinate system having a greatest distance from the centroid e.g. the LAT LONG and LAT LONG coordinate pairs at a greatest distance from the origin to provide an extents area rectangle. Other types of polygons and closed shapes ovals may be employed to provide an extents area for the locate operation to be displayed.

Alternatively if an electronic record has not been previously generated and information received in essentially real time from the locate receiver is to be displayed in a display field a default extents area may be selected in advance based on any of a variety of criteria. For example address and or site description information provided in a ticket pursuant to which the locate operation is performed may provide a basis on which an extents area for the locate operation may be estimated a priori. Similarly as discussed further below in connection with an available digital image of the work site dig area may be employed to determine or estimate an initial extents area for the locate operation.

In block the extents area of the locate operation to be visually rendered is then mapped to an available display field of a display device using any appropriate scaling factor as necessary to ensure that all of the geo location data in the electronic record fits within the display field. For example in one exemplary implementation a transformation may be derived using information relating to the available display field e.g. a reference coordinate system using an appropriate scale for a given display field of a display device to map data points within the extents area to the available display field. In another aspect of this example a buffer area around the extents area may be added to provide one or more suitable margins for the displayed visual representation and or to accommodate different shapes of extents areas to the available display field of the display device and an appropriate transformation may be derived based on this optional additional buffer area.

Once a transformation is derived to map the locate operation extents area to the available display field of a display device in block one or more electronic detection marks and or one or more identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. for environmental landmarks is are rendered in the display field based on applying the transformation to the geo location data present in the data set of the electronic record which in some instances may include one or more actuation data sets . In one exemplary implementation one electronic detection mark is rendered in the display field for each actuation data set of an electronic record. In one aspect as discussed above a given electronic detection mark may be rendered in a particular color and or line type to represent a type of underground facility represented by the mark.

As noted above while in one embodiment there may be a one to one correspondence between electronic detection marks rendered in a single or composite visual representation and actuations automatic data logging interrupt events of a locate receiver in yet other embodiments a single or composite visual representation may provide a variety of other indicators digital representations of detected underground facilities in a computer generated visual rendering. For example illustrates another example of a composite visual representation based on the same electronic record used to generate the composite visual representation of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective locate operations. To this end in one exemplary implementation an additional step may be included in the process shown in in which the processor may process the locate geo location data in an electronic record by filtering averaging interpolating and or otherwise smoothing the data e.g. so as to connect successive discrete detection marks represented by respective actuation data sets event entries of the electronic record and thereby provide a substantially smooth continuous line for display.

Similarly filtering averaging interpolating processing and or otherwise smoothing of data may be applied to landmark information captured in landmark event entries. For example multiple event entries logged for a particular environmental landmark e.g. the four corners of a pedestal may be processed so as to provide a single point in a display field at which to display a symbol icon or other identifier for an environmental landmark. Such processing may include for example selecting any one of multiple geo location coordinates captured in multiple event entries as representative of the landmark location calculating a centroid of all points represented by captured coordinates pre filtering a collection of coordinates to eliminate significant outliers and subsequently determining a centroid of the remaining coordinates etc.

In the example of as also noted above different underground facility types may be indicated in different color lines and the different colors facility types may be derived from the electronic record e.g. based on the correlations provided in Table 7 . Furthermore in other aspects text indicators may be included in the visual representation and or other types of coding may be used different line styles such as patterns width bold etc. a succession of symbols or other graphic icons etc. to indicate different facility types and or some other aspect of a given facility e.g. the material used for a particular pipe conduit cable sheathing the diameter of a particular pipe conduit cable offsets to one or more environmental landmarks etc. . By way of example indicates that the four underground facilities in the composite visual representation correspond to a power line which may be rendered in the color red a first sewer line which may be rendered in the color green a second sewer line which also may be rendered in the color green and a telecommunications line which may be rendered in the color orange . An exemplary composite visual representation may include additional textual numeric and or graphic elements to provide other information available in the electronic record for the locate operations e.g. timestamp information ID information coordinates for location information offset indications etc. . For example in an offset of 3 feet is indicated between the fire hydrant and the sewer line .

In yet another embodiment a single or composite visual representation of a locate operation including one or both of locate information and landmark information may be rendered on a display device together with a digital image representative of at least a portion of a dig area at a work site such that one or more electronic detection marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks appear in appropriate relative positions overlaid on the displayed digital image. illustrates yet another example of a composite visual representation albeit based on an electronic record different than that used to generate the visual representations of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective different underground facilities detected and these lines are overlaid on a digital image of a dig area together with identifiers for environmental landmarks. It should be appreciated that although continuous lines representing underground facilities are depicted on a digital image in in other embodiments discrete electronic detection marks corresponding to successive actuations automatic logging interrupt events of the locate receiver may be overlaid on a digital image of the dig area.

In the embodiment of a number of different image sources and image types may be employed to provide the digital image on which a visual representation of a locate operation may be overlaid. For purposes of the present disclosure such a digital image also referred to herein as an input image may be any image represented by source data that is electronically processed e.g. the source data is in a computer readable format to display the image on a display device. An input image may include any of a variety of paper tangible image sources that are scanned e.g. via an electronic scanner or otherwise converted so as to create source data e.g. in various formats such as XML PDF JPG BMP etc. that can be processed to display the input image. An input image also may include an image that originates as source data or an electronic file without necessarily having a corresponding paper tangible copy of the image e.g. an image of a real world scene acquired by a digital still frame or video camera or other image acquisition device in which the source data at least in part represents pixel information from the image acquisition device .

In some exemplary implementations input images according to the present disclosure may be created provided and or processed by a geographic information system GIS that captures stores analyzes manages and presents data referring to or linked to location such that the source data representing the input image includes pixel information from an image acquisition device corresponding to an acquired real world scene or representation thereof and or spatial geographic information geo encoded information .

In view of the foregoing various examples of input images and source data representing input images according to the present disclosure to which the inventive concepts disclosed herein may be applied include but are not limited to 

It should also be appreciated that source data representing an input image may be compiled from multiple data information sources for example any two or more of the examples provided above for input images and source data representing input images or any two or more other data sources can provide information that can be combined or integrated to form source data that is electronically processed to display an image on a display device.

As noted above in some implementations an input image may be indexed to Global Positioning System GPS coordinates or another coordinate system that provides geo spatial positioning. An input image may include geo coding or other geographical identification metadata and may be provided in any computer readable format. An input image may also include images of map symbols such as roads and street names that may be superimposed upon or displayed separately from an underlying geographic area when the input image is displayed on a display device.

Based on the foregoing a digital image may be displayed in an available display field of a display device either before or after electronic detection marks and or identifiers for environmental landmarks are displayed in the available display field. For example in one implementation after the block in all or a portion of the digital image may be mapped to the available display field based on any relevant geographic information accompanying the digital image e.g. GPS coordinates to which the image is indexed . Alternatively the digital image may be mapped first to the available display field of the display device depending on appropriate scaling and or transformation parameters as would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art and thereafter one or more electronic detection marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks similarly may be mapped to the available display field in appropriate positions relative to the underlying digital image. In the example of a first visual representation of a gas line is depicted a second visual representation of a communication line is depicted and a third visual representation of an electric line is depicted on an aerial image of a residential dig area for purposes of illustration. As discussed above in connection with other embodiments these visual representations may be displayed in different colors and or line types to denote different types of underground facilities and or various attributes of a given facility. As also illustrated in other types of features may be included as part of the displayed image including various environmental landmarks such as junction boxes or transformers streets property boundaries tie downs reference lines between detected and or marked facilities and environmental landmarks and or property boundaries and their associated dimensions and one or more text boxes e.g. to indicate an address of the work site over the residence and the like.

In some implementations locate information and landmark information if displayed together may be differentiated in a display field in any of a variety of manners e.g. different line types symbols or patterns different colors or shades of related colors artificially offset from each other in the display field if locate information and landmark information overlap or are sufficiently close to each other in some instances etc. to allow for sufficient visual perception of both locate information and landmark information.

Additionally in one embodiment each of locate information and landmark information if present in a computer aided visual rendering as well as any constituent information forming part of the locate information and landmark information may be displayed as separate layers of the visual rendering such that a viewer of the visual rendering may turn on and turn off displayed information based on a categorization of the displayed information. shows a generic display device having a display field with exemplary content for purposes of explaining some concepts germane to display layers according to one embodiment. For example all locate information may be categorized generally under one layer designation locate layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly and all landmark information may be categorized generally under yet another layer designation landmark layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly. Respective layers may be enabled or disabled for display in any of a variety of manners for example in one implementation a layer directory or layer legend pane may be included in the display field or as a separate window selectable from the display field of the visual rendering showing all available layers and allowing a viewer to select each available layer to be either displayed or hidden thus facilitating comparative viewing of layers.

Furthermore any of the above mentioned general categories for layers may have sub categories for sub layers such that each sub layer may also be selectively enabled or disabled for viewing by a viewer. For example under the general layer designation of locate layer different facility types that may have been detected during a locate operation and indicated in the locate information by color for example may be categorized under different sub layer designations e.g. designation for locate layer electric designation for locate layer gas etc. in this manner a viewer may be able to hide only the electric locate information while viewing the gas locate information or vice versa in addition to having the option to view or hide all locate information. Sub layer designations similarly may be employed for the landmark information e.g. designation for landmark layer water sewer designation for landmark layer CATV designation for landmark layer buildings . As shown in the example of both the locate and landmark layers are enabled for display amongst the illustrated sub layer designations only the electric sub layer of the locate layer is enabled for display and only the buildings sub layer of the landmark layer is enabled for display. Accordingly using the exemplary composite visual representation shown in as a baseline for purposes of illustration only the power line appears in the electronic rendering A shown in as a constituent element of the electric sub layer of the locate layer together with the building .

Virtually any characteristic of the information available for display may serve to categorize the information for purposes of display layers or sub layers. In particular any of the various exemplary constituent elements of locate information discussed herein e.g. timing information geographic information service related information ticket information target object information locate signal information locate receiver information transmitter information environmental information and operational information the latter two of which are discussed in greater detail further below may be categorized as a sub layer and one or more sub layers may further be categorized into constituent elements for selective display e.g. as sub sub layers . Similarly any of the various exemplary constituent elements of landmark information discussed herein e.g. geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark may be categorized as a sub layer and any sub layer may be further categorized into sub sub layers and so on .

It should further be appreciated that according to various embodiments the attributes and or type of visual information displayed as a result of selecting one or more layers or sub layers is not limited. In particular visual information corresponding to a selected layer or sub layer may be electronically rendered in the form of one or more lines or shapes of various colors shadings and or line types text graphics e.g. symbols or icons and or images for example. Likewise the visual information corresponding to a selected layer or sub layer may include multiple forms of visual information one or more of lines shapes text graphics and or images .

As a non limiting illustrative example a target object sub layer of a locate layer may include respective sub sub layers of different facility types detected in which respective facility types are rendered on the display as lines having different colors line types and or shading. A locate signal sub sub sub layer of a facility type sub sub layer of a target object sub layer may include respective sub sub sub sub layers of different signal characteristics e.g. frequency amplitude phase gain in which different signal values are rendered on the display as text e.g. in proximity to the visual rendering of the detected facility line of the corresponding type . Similarly a temperature sub layer of a locate layer may include ground temperatures sensed during detection of respective facility lines in which sensed temperatures are rendered on the display as an icon symbol in combination with text e.g. a snowflake accompanied by a text label 15 deg. F. in proximity to the visual rendering of the detected facility line. From the foregoing it may be appreciated that a wide variety of information may be categorized in a nested hierarchy of layers and information included in the layers may be visually rendered when selected enabled for display in a variety of manners.

In addition to the locate information and or the landmark information in yet other embodiments in which a digital image is rendered in the display field e.g. as shown in the image information on which the digital image is based may be categorized as its own display layer such that the locate information landmark information and image information may be selectively enabled or disabled for display as a display layer. In this manner the displayed digital image on which one or both of locate information and landmark information may be overlaid and in some instances constituent elements thereof may be toggled on and off conveniently for comparative display.

In one exemplary implementation all image information may be categorized generally under one layer designation e.g. Reference see designation in and independently enabled or disabled for display e.g. hidden accordingly. Similarly while not shown in in some implementations all information available for overlay including both locate information and landmark information if available may be categorized generally under another layer designation e.g. Field and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this alternative implementation under the general layer designation of Field the locate information may be categorized as one sub layer of the Field layer in some cases with additional associated locate sub sub layers and the landmark information may be categorized as another sub layer of the Field layer in some cases with additional associated landmark sub sub layers .

Like the Field layer the Reference layer similarly may have one or more sub layers for various constituent elements of the image information upon which the digital image is rendered. Virtually any number of possible sub layers may be accordingly designated based at least on the various examples of image information discussed above e.g. maps such as road maps or facilities maps dig area indicators either alone or forming part of a digital image grids either alone or forming part of a digital image engineering or architectural drawings photographic renderings etc. any of which may have constituent elements of information that respectively may be categorized as sub sub layers . To provide illustrative non limiting examples of sub layers of the Reference layer indicates a digital image sub layer with the designation a dig area indicator s sub layer with the designation and a grid sub layer with the designation .

The various examples of visual representations illustrated in may be used for various purposes including but not limited to 

According to another aspect of the present invention a locate receiver or other locate device e.g. a locate transmitter includes one or more environmental and or operational sensors which constitute additional examples of input devices from which locate information may be derived. In particular one or more environmental sensors associated with a locate receiver may provide a variety of environmental information in connection with use of the locate receiver similarly one or more operational sensors associated with the locate receiver may provide a variety of operational information in connection with use of the locate receiver. One or both of such environmental information and operational information may constitute all or a portion of locate information and may be employed in any of the manners described above in connection with locate information. In particular environmental information and or operational information may be logged stored in local memory of a locate receiver transferred to and stored in internet accessible memory formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the locate receiver itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server an internet storage site cellular telephone personal digital assistant PDA etc. for storage processing and or analysis.

As used herein environmental sensors are those which sense some condition of the environment in which the locate receiver is present but need not sense a condition of the locate receiver itself. Examples of environmental conditions which may be sensed include but are not limited to temperature humidity light and altitude among others. Environmental sensors may be included with the locate receiver for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the environmental sensors may be used to assess whether a locate operation was or is being performed in suitable environmental conditions e.g. within accepted environmental tolerances . Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may be used to interact with the technician operating the locate receiver for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician if the sensed environmental condition is outside of an acceptable range i.e. out of tolerance . Also the information from the environmental sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the locate receiver such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the locate receiver. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may augment other information collected by the locate receiver such as any of the types of information described above as being collected by a locate receiver according to various embodiments herein. In some instances information from two or more of the environmental sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described in detail below.

As used herein operational sensors are those which sense some operating condition of the locate receiver. Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to the angle of inclination of the locate receiver the direction or heading of the locate receiver a pressure applied to the locate receiver and or some characteristic of motion of the locate receiver e.g. the speed at which the locate receiver is moving the acceleration of the locate receiver etc. among others. Operational sensors may be included with the locate receiver for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the operational sensors may be used to assess whether a locate receiver was or is operating appropriately during a marking operation or whether the locate receiver was or is being operated e.g. both electronically and or physically manipulated appropriately by the technician e.g. within accepted tolerances or according to protocols . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to detect patterns of operation of the technician such as technician signatures in using manipulating the locate receiver e.g. characteristic movements unique to the technician . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to interact with the technician for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician in response to the detected operational characteristic falling outside of an acceptable range. Also the information from the operational sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the locate receiver such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the locate receiver. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more operational sensors may augment other information collected by the locate receiver such as any of the types of information previously described herein in connection with other embodiments. Other uses of data provided by one or more operational sensors are also possible and contemplated in the various aspects described herein. In some instances information from two or more operational sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described below. Furthermore information from one or more operational sensors may be used in combination with information from one or more environmental sensors as also described further below.

It should be appreciated that some of the sensors described herein may be considered both environmental and operational sensors either because the sensor senses both an environmental condition and an operating condition of the locate receiver i.e. the sensor senses more than one condition or because a single condition sensed by the sensor may be considered both an environmental condition and an operating condition. For example an image capture device may be considered both an environmental sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of the surrounding environment and an operational sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of some action the technician has taken for example an image of the manner in which the technician is holding the locate receiver . Furthermore the operation of a sensor may change over time. For example a sensor may be configured at one time to measure an internal operating temperature and at a different time to measure an outside ambient temperature. Thus it should be appreciated that while the sensors described below are categorized generally as being either environmental or operational for purposes of illustrating some exemplary implementations the categories are not mutually exclusive and such categorization is not limiting unless otherwise stated.

With respect to environmental sensors non limiting examples of suitable environmental sensors include a temperature sensor e.g. one or more of an ambient temperature sensor and a surface temperature sensor e.g. a temperature sensor for sensing a temperature of a surface toward which the locate receiver is pointed or oriented a humidity sensor a light sensor an altitude sensor an image capture device e.g. a camera and an audio recorder. This list is not exhaustive however as other types of environmental sensors may be included as appropriate to sense various environmental conditions of interest.

The ambient temperature sensor may be configured to sense the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the locate receiver . The ambient temperature may be a useful piece of information for example in determining whether the temperature is adverse to performance of the locate operation which may occur when the temperature is too hot or too cold. For example in some embodiments it may be preferable to operate the locate receiver only within a predetermined ambient temperature range between 20 F. and 110 F. although other ranges are possible. In addition as described further below the ambient temperature may be useful in combination with one or more other types of environmentally sensed inputs such as humidity in evaluating the conditions in which a locate operation is performed.

The ambient temperature sensor may be any suitable temperature sensor such as an infrared sensor and may be an analog or digital temperature sensor as the various aspects described herein relating to a locate receiver including an ambient temperature sensor are not limited to using any particular type of temperature sensor. According to one embodiment the temperature sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tenn. In some embodiments the ambient temperature sensor may be suitable to operate between 40 F. and 125 F. or over any other suitable range which in some embodiments may encompass the expected temperatures to which the locate receiver may be exposed during normal operation. The data output by the ambient temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or may be transmitted to an external device such as remote computer in those embodiments in which the locate receiver is communicatively coupled to the external device.

The surface temperature sensor may be configured to sense the temperature of the surface toward which the locate receiver is pointing or oriented e.g. the ground under the locate receiver . The temperature of the surface may be useful information for various reasons. Thus as a non limiting example information from the surface temperature sensor may be used to assess whether the locate operation was or is being performed in such recommended temperature conditions. As with the ambient temperature sensor the information provided by the surface temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The surface temperature sensor may be any suitable type of sensor for determining surface temperature such as an infrared temperature sensor or any other suitable type of temperature sensor. In some embodiments the surface temperature sensor may be configured to operate across a range of temperatures encompassing all expected surface temperatures to be encountered during normal operation of the locate receiver. For example in one embodiment the surface temperature sensor may operate between 40 F. and 125 F. although other temperature ranges are also possible.

The humidity sensor may be configured to sense the humidity of the environment in which the locate receiver is used and in some embodiments may provide a relative humidity measurement e.g. 0 to 100 humidity . Such information may be useful alone or in combination with other information in determining whether for example the environment is too humid for performance of the locate operation. The humidity information provided by humidity sensor may be used to assess whether a locate operation was or is being performed within acceptable humidity tolerances. The humidity sensor may be any suitable type of humidity sensor as the type is not limiting. According to one embodiment the humidity sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tenn. The information provided by the humidity sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The light sensor may be configured to sense the intensity flux or illuminance of ambient light in the vicinity of the locate receiver . Such information may be useful for example to assess whether a locate operation was or is being performed in suitable lighting conditions e.g. whether there was sufficient light to allow for accurate performance of a locate operation whether the area surrounding the locate operation is sufficiently lit to ensure worker safety etc. . The light sensor may be any suitable type of light sensor. In one embodiment the light sensor is a cadmium sulfide CdS photocell which is a photoresistor device whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity. Such a device may provide a resistance or voltage measurement as its output indicative of measured flux. However other types of light sensors may alternatively be used. One non limiting example of a suitable photocell is the PDV P5001 from Advanced Photonix Inc. of Ann Arbor Mich.

The units output by the light sensor may depend on whether the light sensor is sensing light intensity light flux or illuminance. For example the output may be in candela for light intensity lumen for flux or lux for illuminance. According to one embodiment target values for illuminance for accurate performance of a marking operation may be between approximately 1 000 lux and 100 000 lux although other ranges may be appropriate based on a particular location and type of locate operation being performed. According to one embodiment the output may be converted to a percentage between 0 and 100 for example in which 0 corresponds to darkness and 100 corresponds to full sunlight. Other outputs may alternatively be produced. The information provided by the light sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

According to one embodiment the locate receiver further comprises a light source such as a flashlight or light emitting diode LED torch. The light source may be activated manually e.g. by the technician or may be coupled to the light sensor e.g. directly coupled or coupled through one or more components such as processor and activated automatically in response to the light sensor sensing an unsatisfactorily low lighting condition e.g. by receiving a signal from the processor or by directly receiving an output signal of the light sensor . The threshold light level for such automatic activation may be any suitable level non limiting examples of which include any level at which the technician may have difficulty seeing and therefore performing the locate operation and any predetermined level below which technician safety may be comprised. Information about such activation of the light source e.g. the occurrence of the activation the time of activation the duration etc. may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The altitude sensor may be configured to measure the altitude of the locate receiver and may be any suitable type of altitude sensor for doing so. The altitude at which a locate operation is performed may impact the performance of the locate operation and worker safety among other considerations. Thus information about the altitude may be useful for a variety of reasons.

The output of the altitude sensor may be in any suitable units and in some embodiments provides an altitude with respect to sea level. For example the altitude sensor may provide an altitude in meters miles feet or any other suitable units. The information provided by the altitude sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The image capture device may be positioned on the locate receiver to capture an image of the environment surrounding the locate receiver or may be configured or configurable in any suitable manner to capture any type of image of interest. According to one embodiment a technician may be meant to take a picture of a job site and or of an environmental landmark at the job site. Thus inclusion of an image capture device in the locate receiver may facilitate compliance with such protocols.

The image capture device may be capable of taking still images video images or both as the various aspects described herein relating to locate receivers including an image capture device are not limited in this respect. Thus the image capture device may be any suitable type of image capture device and in some embodiments may be a type that is suitable for use in a portable device such as but not limited to the types of digital cameras that may be installed in portable phones wide angle digital cameras 360 degree digital cameras infrared IR cameras and the like. In some implementations a wide angle lens and automatic zoom may be utilized to maximize the coverage area of each image.

The output of the image capture device may include various information. The output may include all or part of a captured image. Additionally or alternatively the output may include information about the settings and or operation of the image capture device such as any one or more of resolution frame rate for video images flash status i.e. flash used or not used image size video sequence duration zoom setting etc.

In those embodiments in which the image capture device is a digital device the images may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . The images may be in any standard or proprietary image file format e.g. JPEG TIFF BMP etc. . Furthermore the images may be associated with a specific job a geographic position and an exact time in some embodiments for example by flagging the image based on the time at which it was taken the location at which it was taken and or the job during which it was taken. In one embodiment each captured image may be cached and transmitted with all other captured data from one or more other sensors input devices.

The environmental sensors may further comprise an audio recorder which may be used to capture audio input from a technician and or from the environment e.g. sounds in the vicinity of the locate receiver . Thus in one embodiment the technician may for example dictate notes relating to the performance of the locate operation such as describing visible landmarks in the area of the locate operation notes about performance of the locate receiver or any other notes which may be relevant to performance of a locate operation. In one embodiment the audio recorder may record sounds from the environment such as passing cars planes etc. Such recordings may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician was at the intended location of the locate operation. For example if a passing train is evident from the recording and the intended location is not near a train track the recording may provide evidence that the technician was in the wrong location.

The audio recorder may be an analog or digital device or devices. For example in one embodiment the audio recorder may be an analog recorder configured to receive an analog input signal e.g. from a microphone and store the analog signal. According to another embodiment the audio recorder may be a digital audio recorder including any suitable combination of components for receiving an analog signal e.g. from a microphone converting the analog signal to a digital signal performing any suitable digital signal processing e.g. filtering amplifying converting to text etc. and storing the digital information. According to one embodiment the audio recorder may include a dedicated digital audio processor to perform those functions recited or any other suitable functions. It should be appreciated from the foregoing that a microphone not shown in may be associated with the audio recorder to provide the audio input to the audio recorder.

According to one embodiment for example in which a technician may dictate notes the audio processing of the audio input may include performing speech recognition e.g. speech to text generation . Such functionality may be provided by suitable speech recognition software executing on a dedicated audio processor or in any other suitable manner. Any generated text may be for example displayed on a display of the user interface or may be stored for later display on a separate device.

The recordings provided by the audio recorder may be stored in a dedicated audio memory in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . In those embodiments in which the audio recorder is a digital audio recorder the audio files may be in any standard or proprietary audio file format e.g. WAV MP3 etc. .

Although not illustrated in the communication interface of may also serve as or enable another environmental sensor. According to one embodiment the locate receiver may be internet enabled and information may be received via the communication interface over the internet. According to one embodiment information about an environmental condition may be received via the communication interface. For example temperature information or humidity information among others may be received over the internet via communication interface . In such instances the received temperature or humidity information may augment any temperature and humidity information collected by a temperature and humidity sensor of the locate receiver or may replace such information such that in some embodiments the locate receiver may not include a physical temperature or humidity sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that the communication interface may serve as a virtual sensor by receiving environmental information of interest not being limited to temperature and humidity.

It should be appreciated from the foregoing as well as the further discussion below that environmental information may be collected for various purposes. According to one embodiment the environmental information may be useful for assessing a locate device e.g. locate receiver or locate operation. According to another embodiment the environmental information may be useful for assessing the conditions in which marking material is being dispensed. As previously explained locate operations may involve the use of a locate receiver to detect a facility location and a marking device to mark the facility location for example by dispensing a marking material. The environmental information sensed by the environmental sensors may be useful for assessing the conditions in which marking material is being dispensed in those situations in which a marking device is being used in connection with the locate receiver. Some marking materials e.g. paint for example may have preferred temperature ranges and humidity levels among other conditions in which they may be dispensed. Thus environmental information may facilitate determination of whether a marking material was or is being dispensed in suitable environmental conditions.

As explained above another type of input device which may be included with a locate receiver or locate transmitter is an operational sensor. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention and as shown in the locate receiver may include one or more operational sensors for sensing one or more operating conditions or characteristics of the locate receiver.

One or more operational temperature sensors may be configured to sense any temperature of interest with respect to the locate receiver . For example it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of the processing circuitry of the locate receiver such as the temperature of the processor . Alternatively it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of other components of the locate receiver for example the temperature of one of the other operational sensors . Thus it should be appreciated that a plurality of operational temperature sensors may be included and arranged to sense any operating temperatures of interest of the locate receiver . In this manner the operating temperatures of one or more components of the locate receiver may be monitored and an alert or notification may be generated e.g. by the control electronics and provided to the technician if one of the operating temperatures is determined to be outside of an acceptable tolerance for example if a component is overheating. Alternatively the temperature from one or more operational temperature sensors may be used to calibrate or compensate data or signals provided by any one of the other sensors which may have a temperature dependent output.

The temperature sensor s may be any suitable temperature sensor such as a temperature dependent variable resistor or any other type of temperature sensor suitable for measuring the temperature of the components of interest of the locate receiver. The temperature sensor may be configured to operate over any suitable temperature range of interest which in one embodiment may be from 40 F. to 125 F. although other temperature ranges may be employed in other embodiments. The data output by the temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or may be transmitted to an external device such as remote computer in those embodiments in which the locate receiver is communicatively coupled to the external device.

The compass may be configured to determine the direction in which the locate receiver is facing and therefore may be positioned at one of various suitable locations. For example according to one embodiment the compass may be positioned toward the top of the locate receiver and aligned such that the compass identifies the direction toward which the front of the locate receiver points i.e. the direction in which the locate receiver faces when held by the technician . The heading information provided by the compass may be provided in degrees or in any other suitable units and may be provided relative to a reference direction e.g. relative to true North . According to one embodiment the compass may be initially calibrated to true North such that subsequent heading readings may be relative to true North.

The heading information provided by the compass may be useful to determine a direction in which the technician moves during a locate operation. Such information may be particularly useful in instances in which the location tracking system does not provide a signal or a sufficiently accurate signal to monitor the technician s movements. The compass may be any suitable type of compass including analog or digital and may provide any suitable readout. According to one embodiment the compass is a digital compass which provides a heading of the locate receiver . According to one embodiment the compass may include one or more gyroscopes. According to one embodiment the compass is an OS4000 T solid state tilt compensated nano compass available from OceanServer Technology Inc. of Fall River Mass. The information provided by the compass may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The inclinometer may be any suitable inclinometer configurable to measure an angle of inclination of the locate receiver . According to one embodiment the inclinometer may provide an angle with respect to ground. According to one embodiment the inclinometer may be a multi axis digital device and may sense angles with respect to horizontal and or vertical planes. The inclinometer may provide a voltage as an output signal indicative of the angle of inclination. According to some embodiments the inclinometer may have an output range spanning 30 degrees e.g. with respect to ground although other ranges may alternatively be provided by some inclinometers.

The inclinometer may be positioned toward the top of the locate receiver for example near where the technician may hold the locate receiver during use. Alternatively according to another embodiment the inclinometer may be positioned substantially near the tip of the locate receiver i.e. the end of the locate receiver held proximate the ground when the locate receiver is in use which may be substantially the same as the tip of locate receiver shown in . Other locations for the inclinometer with respect to the locate receiver are also possible.

The information provided by the inclinometer may be useful for one or more of various purposes. For example according to one embodiment the information about the angle of the locate receiver may be useful in determining whether the technician is appropriately using the locate receiver e.g. for determining whether the locate receiver is being held at a suitable angle relative to the surface e.g. the ground under which a facility is disposed and in some instances may therefore be used to disable part of the locate receiver e.g. detection electronics if the technician is holding the locate receiver at an inappropriate angle. According to another embodiment as described in further detail below in connection with the information about the angle of the locate receiver may be used to determine the location of one point of the locate receiver relative to a second point of the locate receiver e.g. for use in determining the relative positioning of the tip of the locate receiver compared to the top of the locate receiver . The information provided by the inclinometer may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

One or more accelerometers may be configured to sense the acceleration of the locate receiver and may provide an output in terms of g force or in any other suitable units. Such information may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician is appropriately using e.g. physically moving or manipulating the locate receiver . For example there may be predetermined acceptable acceleration ranges associated with normal operation of the locate receiver e.g. associated with the typical sweeping motion of the locate receiver as the technician scans for a buried facility and therefore the accelerometer s may provide information which may be used to assess whether a technician is operating the locate receiver within those acceptable ranges. In addition any acceleration data provided by the accelerometer s may be integrated to obtain velocity data and or integrated twice to obtain data about distance traveled e.g. via appropriate functionality included in the locate data algorithm or other algorithm executed by the processor either of which integration results may be useful for a variety of reasons. The acceleration information provided by the accelerometer s may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The accelerometer s may be any suitable accelerometer for sensing the acceleration of the locate receiver and may provide any suitable outputs. According to one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer providing an indication of the acceleration of the locate receiver along three orthogonal axes. The output of each axis may be a frequency e.g. in Hz or may be converted to units of g. For example in one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer that outputs a signal ranging from 0.5 Hz 550 Hz for the z axis from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the x axis and from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the y axis. Again the accelerometer may alternatively provide an output in terms of g or any other suitable units. In one exemplary implementation an accelerometer may be an ADXL 330KCPZ RL accelerometer available from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. In some exemplary implementations the accelerometer may output acceleration data whereas in other implementations the accelerometer may output velocity data along each of the three axes as well as the orientation of the accelerometer.

In addition to providing acceleration data an accelerometer may be operated as an inclinometer according to known techniques see e.g. description at http www.tilt china.com uploadPDF How to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer pdf viewed on Jan. 27 2010 and prepared by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Thus according to one embodiment of the present invention a locate receiver may include an accelerometer configured to function as an inclinometer and therefore provide a measure of inclination of the locate receiver.

Furthermore as explained in greater detail below the locate receiver may comprise a plurality of accelerometers located at different positions with respect to the locate receiver. Information from such accelerometers may be useful for example in assessing the relative motion of one portion e.g. the tip of the locate receiver with respect to a second portion e.g. the top of the locate receiver for example using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 A1 published Oct. 16 2008 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. According to one such non limiting embodiment one accelerometer may be positioned near the tip of the locate receiver and a second accelerometer may be positioned near the top of the locate receiver. Both may be 3 axis accelerometers. Such an arrangement may also be used to determine the location of the tip of the locate receiver relative to the location of the top of the locate receiver as explained below in connection with .

Additionally the data output by one or both accelerometers may be used to monitor for out of tolerance operation of the locate receiver such as improper manipulation of the locate receiver by the technician. For example acceleration data from either accelerometer may be indicative of whether the locate receiver is being swung thrown or dropped among other things. For example acceleration values from either accelerometer above some threshold value for a sufficient duration e.g. for one second or greater or any other suitable duration may be indicative of the locate receiver being thrown or dropped. The threshold value of acceleration indicative of such behavior may be different for the two accelerometers. Similarly detection of acceleration values deviating from an expected or target pattern may be indicative of misuse of the locate receiver. In response to detecting such manipulation of the locate receiver various actions may be taken such as generating an alert logging an event disabling the actuation system and or detection electronics of the locate receiver or any of the actions described further below.

Moreover a locate receiver may be provided with two accelerometers to monitor whether the locate receiver is being held in a satisfactory manner during use. For example it may be preferable for a locate receiver to be maintained at a substantially perpendicular angle relative to ground as a technician is locating even when the technician is moving e.g. sweeping or swinging the locate receiver. It should be appreciated that when operated in such a manner the top of the locate receiver and the tip of the locate receiver may exhibit similar acceleration characteristics e.g. peaks in acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion minimum values of acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion etc. By positioning an accelerometer toward the tip of the locate receiver and another toward the top of the locate receiver the resulting acceleration data may be indicative of whether the technician is holding the locate receiver perpendicular to ground or otherwise properly manipulating the locate receiver.

Other uses for multiple accelerometers on a locate receiver are also possible and those examples listed above are non limiting.

The operational sensors may further comprise a yaw rate sensor which may be configured to sense the yaw rate i.e. a twisting motion of the locate receiver. The yaw rate sensor may be any suitable yaw rate sensor and may provide its output in any suitable units for example in degrees per second degrees sec . One non limiting example of a suitable yaw rate sensor is an ADXRS610BBGZ RL gyro sensor from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. According to another embodiment a yaw rate measurement may be provided by some types of compasses such that a combination compass and yaw rate sensor may be used. The yaw rate sensor may be positioned at any suitable location on the locate receiver to detect yaw rate. The information provided by the yaw rate sensor may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The proximity sensor may be configured to measure the distance from any point of interest of the locate receiver to a point of interest in its surroundings. For example in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned at the tip of the locate receiver and may be oriented to determine the distance between the tip of the locate receiver and any surface e.g. a target surface of interest such as the ground a landmark a wall etc. Alternatively in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned toward the top of the locate receiver and oriented to determine a distance between the top of the locate receiver and the target surface e.g. ground . Other configurations are also possible.

Information about the distance from the locate receiver to any surrounding surface may be useful for one of various reasons. For example such information may be useful in assessing whether a technician is properly operating the locate receiver. As a non limiting example there may be predetermined acceptable distances between the locate receiver and the surface under which a facility is located when scanning for the facility. As an example it may be preferable in some embodiments to hold the locate receiver between one and twelve inches from the surface. The proximity sensor may be used to determine whether the technician is maintaining the locate receiver at an acceptable distance from the surface. Alternatively according to another embodiment and as described in greater detail below the distance of a portion of the locate receiver from the ground may be useful in determining the distance between two points of the locate receiver.

The proximity sensor may be any suitable type of proximity sensor e.g. any commercially available proximity sensor including an analog or digital device. In one embodiment proximity sensor may be a Sharp GP2D120 short range IR distance sensor from Sharp Electronics Corporation Mahwah N.J. and is able to take a substantially continuous distance reading and return a corresponding analog voltage with a range of about 1.6 inches to about 12 inches. Such a proximity sensor may be suitable for example when the sensor is used to sense the distance from the tip of the locate receiver to the ground since such a distance may typically be less than about 12 inches. According to another embodiment the proximity sensor may be a sonar device. Other types of proximity sensors may also be suitably used. The information provided by the proximity sensor e.g. a distance value for example in centimeters meters or feet may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The pressure sensor may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the locate receiver. For example according to one embodiment it may be desirable to detect the pressure applied to a handle of the locate receiver e.g. handle in for instance to determine whether a technician is holding the locate receiver and if so whether it is being held appropriately. Accordingly a pressure sensor may be positioned in the handle of the locate receiver in one non limiting embodiment and configured to detect the pressure applied to the handle. According to another embodiment it may be desirable to determine the pressure applied to an actuation system of the locate receiver for example if the actuation system is a trigger e.g. actuator in . Accordingly a pressure sensor may be configured to determine the pressure applied to the trigger or other actuation mechanism in those embodiments in which the locate receiver includes such a trigger or actuation mechanism. According to one embodiment the locate receiver may include multiple pressure sensors for example one for determining the pressure applied to a handle of the locate receiver and one for determining a pressure applied to an actuation system of the locate receiver. However any number of pressure sensors may be included and they may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the locate receiver.

The pressure sensor may be any suitable type of pressure sensor for detecting the pressure of interest. The information provided by the pressure sensor which may be in any suitable units may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The locate receiver may further include device health monitoring capability. Characteristics of the health of the locate receiver which may be the subject of monitoring include but are not limited to battery life battery drain level battery charging capacity wireless signal strength in those embodiments in which the locate receiver has wireless capabilities network connectivity operating temperature available memory and the status of any one or more input devices of the locate receiver such as an accelerometer location tracking system e.g. GPS receiver image capture device light sensor etc. To this end the locate receiver may include hardware and or software configured to serve the health monitoring purpose.

According to one embodiment the locate receiver may include a processor e.g. processor configured to run a device health software program or application to process the inputs from one or more operational sensors such as operational temperature sensor to assess whether those inputs indicate the locate receiver is operating appropriately. According to another embodiment the locate receiver may include dedicated device health hardware such as device health sensor which may provide data that is processed by a device health software program for example executing on processor to assess the health of the locate receiver. Non limiting examples of device health sensor include a voltmeter and an ammeter among others.

In one embodiment data provided by the device health sensor may indicate that a low battery condition is present during the locate operation and thus it may be determined that the operations of the locate receiver are not reliable. Other device conditions such as wireless signal strength e.g. in those embodiments in which the locate receiver is wirelessly coupled to an external device such as remote computer available memory temperature of one or more components of the locate receiver power connection of one or more components of the locate receiver or other conditions of the locate receiver may be monitored by a device health sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that a locate receiver according to the embodiments described herein may include any suitable number of device health sensors for monitoring a desired number of device conditions.

According to one embodiment a record or message may be created based on operation of the device health sensor. For example a record or message may be created including a device ID e.g. of the locate receiver and the current state of certain device components such as input devices e.g. environmental and operational sensors . The record or message may also or alternatively include an identification of any resource utilization that is nearing a specified threshold e.g. memory nearing capacity . Thus it should be appreciated that various conditions may be monitored under the rubric of monitoring the health of the locate receiver and various actions taken in response to such monitoring.

The operational sensors may further comprise the image capture device . As previously mentioned the image capture device may be considered an operational sensor for example if and when configured to capture an image relating to the operation of the locate receiver .

Furthermore the operational sensors may comprise an audio recorder similar to or the same as audio recorder and therefore shown as audio recorder in . For example the locate receiver may include multiple audio recorders with one or more operating as an environmental sensor e.g. recording acoustic input from the environment and one or more operating as operational sensors e.g. recording acoustic input relating to operation of one or more components of the locate receiver. According to one embodiment a microphone associated with the audio recorder is positioned to detect sound emitted by a component of interest of the locate receiver. The audio input may also be stored by the audio recorder and processed in any suitable manner.

As previously described the audio recorder may be any suitable audio recorder including a digital audio recorder or analog audio recorder for example of any of the types previously described. In one embodiment the audio recorder may comprise a dedicated PIC processor. In those embodiments in which the locate receiver includes two or more audio recorders e.g. one operating an as environmental sensor and another operating as an operational sensor the audio recorders may share any suitable combination of circuitry. For example multiple audio recorders may share a same digital signal processor e.g. a dedicated audio signal processor . A separate microphone may be associated with each audio recorder or a microphone may be shared between two or more audio recorders. Thus it should be appreciated that the exact configuration and components of audio recorders according to the various embodiments described herein are not limiting.

The audio files produced by an audio recorder operating as an operational sensor may be stored locally in dedicated audio memory in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

In any of the embodiments illustrated in any one or more of the environmental sensors illustrated in and or operational sensors illustrated in may be operated in any suitable manner including continuously periodically and or in response to an event or trigger e.g. one or more actuations of the locate receiver or in any other suitable manner. For example one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate continuously during performance of a locate operation. In particular the ambient temperature sensor may output a substantially continuous data stream indicative of the sensed ambient temperature. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor and light sensor may output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the respective sensed conditions. The inclinometer compass accelerometer yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor may also output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the sensed operation. The image capture device may record a video sequence continuously during the locate operation and the audio recorder may continuously record any audio input during performance of the locate operation.

Alternatively one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated and or polled periodically with the resulting output data being logged and or transmitted periodically. For example the ambient temperature sensor may provide an output signal indicative of the sensed ambient temperature every second every five seconds every ten seconds every minute every ten minutes or at any other suitable time interval. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor light sensor operational temperature sensor s inclinometer compass accelerometer s yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor s may output data at periodic intervals. The image capture device may capture a still image or a video sequence of any desired duration at periodic intervals. The audio recorder may capture audio of any desired duration at periodic intervals. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may themselves operate so as to provide output information in an essentially continuous fashion but only be read or polled e.g. by processor on some discrete or periodic basis. Accordingly output signals or data provided by one or more sensors may be acquired logged into local memory and or transmitted to an external device in any of a variety of manners.

According to another embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate be read discretely and or be polled and therefore the corresponding data may be logged and or transmitted in response to actuation of the actuation system of the locate receiver. For example actuation of the actuation system may trigger collection of magnetic field data and simultaneously may trigger recording of a sensed ambient temperature from ambient temperature sensor in the local memory . The remaining environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated read and or polled in a similar manner.

In one embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be activated read discretely and or polled by the technician irrespective of whether the actuation system is actuated. For example the technician may activate read and or poll one or more of the environmental sensors by depressing a selection button corresponding to the environmental sensor s by choosing a selection button or menu option from a user interface of the locate receiver in those embodiments in which the locate receiver includes a user interface or in any other suitable manner. The operational sensors may operate similarly.

Thus it should be appreciated that the operation of sensors and reading and or logging and or transmitting of data from the environmental sensors and operational sensors is not limited to any particular manner or time but rather that various suitable schemes are contemplated. Also it should be appreciated that in those embodiments in which a locate receiver comprises multiple sensors the sensors need not operate in the same manner as each other. For example one or more of the sensors may operate periodically while one or more may only provide their data output in response to actuation of the locate receiver actuation system. In one embodiment a plurality of the sensors may provide their data outputs periodically but at different rates. As an example the accelerometers and yaw rate sensor of the locate receiver may output their data at relatively high frequencies such as in the kHz range MHz range or higher. The temperature sensors humidity sensor and light sensor may output their data at relatively lower frequencies such as approximately 1 Hz for example because those quantities may not change as rapidly as the quantities measured by the accelerometers and the yaw rate sensor. Other operating schemes are also possible.

According to one embodiment the output data from the sensors is only read and stored upon actuation of the actuation system even though the sensors may update their outputs at the above indicated frequencies or any other suitable frequencies. Upon such actuation data from any one or more of the sensors may be read out and stored in memory. The stored data may therefore represent the values present at the sensors at the time of actuation. In this manner data values output by the sensors when the trigger is not actuated may not be stored in some instances but rather may be updated by the subsequent data value from the sensor. In this manner only the most recent data from the sensors may be stored upon actuation. Other operating schemes are also possible.

As mentioned previously environmental information and or operational information output by any one or more environmental sensors and operational sensors of the locate receiver e.g. of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used for one or more of various purposes some of which have been previously described. Examples of such purposes include assessing whether a locate operation was or is being performed within environmental and or operational tolerances interacting with the technician and or controlling altering operation of the locate receiver and augmenting data records files.

To this end the various environmental information and or operational information provided by various sensors may be organized and handled as data in various formats and in some implementations may be organized in terms of events and corresponding event entries formatted according to a particular protocol for example as discussed above in connection with Tables 2 through 5. Event entries similar to these and including various environmental and or operational information may be generated by the locate receiver at some point once information has been read acquired from environmental and or operational sensors the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be transmitted by the locate receiver e.g. to remote computer .

In some implementations environmental information and or operational information may be contained within one or more event entries corresponding to an actuation of the locate receiver such that the environmental information and or the operational information is part of an actuation data set. Table 12 below illustrates a modification of an event entry originally depicted in Table 3 above in which environmental information and operational information is included as part of the data formatted in an actuation event entry according to one example. The information for acceleration may include three values for each axis of each accelerometer. One value for a particular axis may be a raw value the second value for a particular axis may be a high pass filtered value and the third value may be a low pass filtered value. Data values are only shown for one of the two accelerometers listed. Locate information from one or more input devices other components of the locate receiver is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

The contents of an information field for a particular piece of environmental information and or operational information in an event entry may have any of a number of forms for example the content may be strictly numeric e.g. according to some predetermined scale units of measure for the numeric information alphanumeric e.g. 78 F text e.g. YES symbolic e.g. Y or N to indicate yes or no or some other symbol to provide an indication such as to indicate sensor failure or no sensor information available or referential in nature e.g. a filename pointer or other link to provide an indication of where relevant information relating to the particular environmental and or operational condition may be found .

In other implementations one or both of environmental information and or operational information may be formatted in one or more particular event entries generated specifically to provide such information in a manner that is not necessarily related to actuation of the locate receiver. For example such sensor read events may be generated as the result of the processor reading one or more environmental and or operational sensors one or more times while a job is in progress e.g. on a periodic basis pursuant to processor polls . Table 13 below provides an example of such a sensor read event entry.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including event entries or information derived therefrom as discussed above any number of file formats may be employed e.g. ASCII XML .

The exemplary electronic record shown in may be used to evaluate performance of a locate operation for example by reviewing information in the actuation data set C the ticket information service related information the environmental information and or the operational information . It should be appreciated that the electronic record includes some information that assumes that the locate receiver includes the timing system and the location tracking system such as the timing and location information shown in the electronic record.

Table 14 provides an example of a data record that may be generated by locate receiver upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the locate receiver identification the receiver mode a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system geo location data signal strength data gain of the locate receiver signal frequency data facility depth data facility type data ground type data locate request data and information relating to the environmental sensors . This example is provided for purposes of illustration and is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the locate receiver .

In a manner similar to Table 14 Table 15A provides another example of a data record that may be generated by locate receiver upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the locate receiver identification the receiver mode a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system geo location data signal strength data gain of the locate receiver signal frequency data facility depth data facility type data ground type data locate request data and information relating to the operational sensors . The location tracking system provides the geo location data. The temperature sensor s provides the temperature data. The compass provides the heading. The inclinometer provides the inclination. The accelerometer s provides the acceleration and in this embodiment is a 3 axis accelerometer. The yaw rate sensor provides the yaw rate. The proximity sensor provides the distance which may represent the distance from the tip of the locate receiver to the ground in one non limiting embodiment. The pressure sensor provides the pressure measurement. This example is provided for purposes of illustration and is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the locate receiver .

While Tables 14 and 15A respectively indicate the collection of environmental information and operational information separately and as part of an actuation data set it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. In particular both environmental information and operational information may be collected together as part of a given actuation data set. Furthermore the inclusion of one or both of environmental information and operational information in an electronic record such as the electronic record need not be limited to one or more particular actuation data sets rather in some exemplary implementations one or both of environmental information and operational information may be included as a unique component of an electronic record apart from any particular actuation data set e.g. one or both of environmental and operational information may be common to or shared by one or more actuation data sets .

As mentioned previously locate transmitters may also include environmental and or operational sensors to sense environmental and or operating conditions. Such information may be useful in assessing the general environmental conditions of a locate operation and the operating conditions of the locate transmitter among other things. illustrates a non limiting example of a locate transmitter including environmental and operational sensors.

As shown the data acquisition system includes a locate transmitter and the remote computer . The locate transmitter includes control electronics including a processor local memory a communication interface a user interface a timing system and a location tracking system . Those components may be substantially the same as the previously described components of control electronics and therefore are not described in detail now. The control electronics also includes an activation system which may provide a technician with the capability to generate an applied signal using the locate transmitter . The activation system may comprise a mechanical and or electrical mechanism. For example the activation system may be a switch button knob dial or other activation device and may provide the capability for setting the frequency and amplitude of the applied signal . Furthermore the activation system may be used to prompt the capture and or storage of certain locate information generated and or received by locate transmitter e.g. applied signal frequency applied signal amplitude status of the locate transmitter environmental and or operational information or any other types of locate information described herein in a manner similar to that described above in connection with the actuation systems of the described locate receivers. Alternatively the locate information may be collected and or stored according to any of the previously described schemes for locate receivers e.g. continuously periodically in response to an event etc. .

In response to activating the activation system the transmitter circuitry may generate and transmit the applied signal . The transmitter circuitry may be any transmitter circuitry capable of generating a suitable applied signal. According to one embodiment the transmitter circuitry is configured to provide an applied signal of variable frequency and amplitude. For example the frequency of applied signal may be adjustable in increments from about 50 Hz to about 200 kHz as a non limiting example.

As shown the locate transmitter also includes a power source which may be substantially the same as previously described power source and which is therefore not described in detail now.

Moreover the locate transmitter includes the environmental sensors operational sensors and light source . These components may be positioned at any suitable location s of the locate transmitter and may operate as previously described.

Information collected by the locate transmitter may be used to form an event entry and or an electronic record. For example event entries similar to those shown in Tables 12 and 13 may be generated in the context of the locate transmitter . Similarly an electronic record similar those of Tables 14 and 15A may be generated. As a non limiting example Table 15B illustrates an electronic record which may be generated by the locate transmitter for example in response to activation of the activation system .

It should be appreciated that Table 15B illustrates a non limiting example of an electronic record that may be generated in accordance with operation of the locate transmitter and that other forms of electronic records including other types of information may also or alternatively be generated.

In addition it should be appreciated that in some embodiments a locate transmitter and locate receiver may communicate with each other and or a remote computer such as remote computer . For example in one embodiment each of a locate transmitter and locate receiver forming a locate set may communicate directly with a remote computer for example to provide the types of information identified in Tables 14 15A and 15B. According to another embodiment one of the locate receiver and locate transmitter may send its information e.g. the information illustrated in Tables 14 15A and 15B to the other of the two. The device receiving such information may then send the information to the remote computer or other type of remote device . Other schemes for communication between a locate receiver and locate transmitter are also possible.

Environmental information and or operational information as well as any of the other constituent components of locate information and landmark information discussed herein may be used to assess whether a locate device e.g. locate receiver is being used and or a locate operation was or is being performed in accordance with recommended practices or within recommended environmental or operational conditions. For simplicity the following discussion focuses on locate receivers although the concepts described also apply to locate transmitters such as previously described locate transmitter .

As an illustrative example there may be certain preferred environmental conditions in which a locate receiver may be used and or a locate operation may be performed.

Additionally there may be certain preferred process tolerances with respect to performing locate operations. For example there may be a minimum ambient light specification a certain angle specification with respect to the locate receiver relative to a target surface a certain distance specification i.e. distance from target surface a certain motion specification with respect to sweeping the locate receiver and the like. Violations of these process tolerances may result in poorly performed locate operations which may result in poor customer satisfaction and an increased risk of damage to facilities.

Other environmental and operational tolerances may also be applicable to locate operations and it should be appreciated that those listed above are non limiting examples provided for purposes of illustration.

In view of the foregoing according to another aspect of the present invention a locate receiver or a locate operations system comprising a locate receiver may include an operations monitoring application that operates in combination with the locate receiver or that is installed fully or in part on the locate receiver. In exemplary implementations discussed below an operations monitoring application may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment such as the locate receivers described herein for out of tolerance environmental or operational conditions. For example the operations monitoring application of the present disclosure may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of the locate receiver within the limits of its product specifications with respect to for example the ambient temperature and humidity. Additionally or alternatively monitoring may be based on certain standard operating procedures e.g. as established by a facility owner a locate contractor a regulatory body etc. . Other bases for monitoring the operation of a locate receiver may also be used.

According to one aspect of this embodiment once an out of tolerance condition is detected either environmental or operational an out of tolerance alert or notification may be provided to the user technician of the locate receiver. In some exemplary implementations the out of tolerance alert may be generated by the control electronics of the locate receiver although not all implementations are limited in this respect. Additionally or alternatively a record of such out of tolerance alerts may be stored such as a record of alert acknowledgments that may be stored or transmitted by the locate receiver in response to technician acknowledgement of the alert.

An example of an operations monitoring application is now described. For purposes of illustration the operations monitoring application is described in connection with locate receiver discussed above in connection with . However it should be appreciated that the operations monitoring application may be used in connection with other locate receivers described herein as well as with locate transmitters e.g. locate transmitters equipped with environmental and or operational sensors .

Referring to a functional block diagram of an example of an operations monitoring application for detecting and monitoring the use of a locate receiver e.g. locate receiver in this non limiting example for out of tolerance conditions is presented. Operations monitoring application may include an operations algorithm which is a software algorithm for determining whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions are present during locate operations and or whether violations of certain process tolerances occur.

To make determinations of out of tolerance conditions occurrences operations algorithm may compare information supplied at an expected data input to information supplied at an actual data input . For example an operating limits table may provide the source of information feeding expected data input . An example of the contents of operating limits table is shown in Table 16 below. It should be appreciated that such a table may include entries for any one or more conditions sensed by a sensor of the locate receiver and that those entries shown are non limiting examples. Also operating limits table may include information applicable to locate transmitters in those embodiments in which a locate transmitter is being used.

The contents of operating limits table may be informed by standard operating procedures SOP information . In this respect the contents of operating limits table may have a dynamic component. That is in the event that the content of SOP information is modified and or that the content of SOP information varies for example from one geographic location to another or from one job work site to another the content of operating limits table may automatically vary accordingly. SOP information may include information such as but not limited to state local and or regional regulations with respect to underground facility locate and marking operations locate service provider policy information contractual information and the like. Further SOP information may include information about the current industry accepted best practices and or procedures with respect to underground facility locate and marking operations.

One source of information that may be included in SOP information may be for example the information of the Best Practices Version 6.0 document published in February 2009 by the Common Ground Alliance CGA of Alexandria Va. www.commongroundalliance.com which document is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety this document is a compilation of current recommended practices designed to prevent damage to underground facilities . Other sources of information for SOP information are also possible.

Generally the contents of operating limits table may be variable and dynamic based on one or more factors such as but not limited to dynamic information that may be included in SOP information best practices that may vary with time of year best practices that may vary with time of day best practices that may vary with weather conditions best practices that may vary with the skill level of the locate technician and the like.

According to one embodiment the information supplied to actual data input is generated and or collected in real time during locate operations that are performed in the field. For example the source of information feeding actual data input may be the locate receiver although locate receiver is only a non limiting example as any of the locate receivers described herein may be used. The actual data input may be fed with the data from one or more of the sensors and which data is indicated generally in as sensor data .

Referring again to Table 16 the values that are contained in operating limits table may be expressed in terms that correspond to the data format that is returned from sensors and . For example in one embodiment the light sensor output may be a voltage and thus the ambient light level may be expressed in volts in operating limits table . However the values in table are not limited to being in any particular format.

Operations algorithm may compare the information of operating limits table that is present at expected data input to the information of sensor data that is present at actual data input to determine whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions and or violations of certain process tolerances are present during locate operations. In one example operations algorithm may determine whether locate operations are being performed when the ambient temperature is too hot or too cold or when the ambient humidity is too high. In another example operations algorithm may determine whether the locate receiver angle or distance detected during locate operations exceed acceptable parameters. In yet another example operations algorithm may determine whether locate operations are being performed when it is too dark based on a comparison of a sensed light level to a light level specification.

When out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions and or violations of certain process specifications are detected operations algorithm may generate out of tolerance alerts the contents of which may reflect the nature of the out of tolerance condition. The alerts may take any suitable form such as an audible alert a chime a ring tone a verbal message or command e.g. synthesized speech provided by a text to speech synthesizer of the locate receiver etc. for example presented via a speaker of the locate receiver a visual alert e.g. a text display presented via display or any other suitable display an indicator light etc. a tactile alert e.g. vibration of a tactile indicator as described below in connection with any combination of those options or any other suitable type of notification.

Any out of tolerance alerts that are generated may be logged in an alerts log of operations monitoring application . Further in those embodiments in which the operations monitoring application is not loaded and running on the locate receiver itself any out of tolerance alerts that are generated may be transmitted to the locate receiver in which the control electronics may process the out of tolerance alerts . For example control electronics may receive out of tolerance alerts and present the contents thereof to the user of locate receiver e.g. visually and or audibly via the display and or a speaker via a tactile indicator etc. .

Additionally control electronics may generate alert acknowledgments that correspond to out of tolerance alerts . Alert acknowledgments may be returned to operations monitoring application and logged in alerts log . Alert acknowledgments provide evidence that out of tolerance alerts have been received and processed at locate receiver . The contents of alerts log may be useful to various business applications with respect to locate operations. For example the contents of alerts log may be useful to business applications for assessing the quality of locate operations that are performed in the field assessing the skill and or competency levels of technicians and the like. In a specific example out of tolerance alerts in alerts log may be monitored in real time by for example management personnel of locate companies e.g. locate contractors facility owners regulatory authorities or other agencies wherein certain actions in response to out of tolerance alerts may be initiated in real time by the management personnel.

In one implementation operations monitoring application may be installed and executing on a computing device not shown that is separate from locate receiver but in communication with the locate receiver such as remote computer . In another implementation operations monitoring application may be installed in memory and executing via one or more processors on a locate receiver itself such the locate receiver . In yet another implementation certain functionality and or components of operations monitoring application may be installed and executing fully or in part on the combination of a separate computing device and a locate receiver e.g. locate receiver .

To facilitate operation of a locate receiver e.g. locate receiver with operations monitoring application of when the application is executed partly or entirely on a separate computing device e.g. remote computer the locate receiver may have loaded thereon an operations monitoring client which may be a counterpart to operations monitoring application . For example the operations monitoring client may be executed by the processor and may process information of operations monitoring application . Alternatively the operations monitoring client may comprise a combination of hardware and software and or firmware which may be coupled to the locate receiver to communicate with the processor . In such an embodiment the software and or firmware may process information of operations monitoring application . Alternatively as note above the control electronics of the locate receiver may include fully or in part operations monitoring application itself. According to one embodiment the operations monitoring client is programmed to enable and disable detection electronics of the locate receiver .

Table 17 shows an example of sensor data that may be returned from environmental sensors and operational sensors . Further sensor data may include timestamp information for example from the timing system .

Non limiting examples of how the data provided by the environmental sensors and operational sensors may be used by the operations monitoring application are now given. It should be appreciated that numerous other conditions may be detected and acted upon.

Other conditions and events that may arise with the operations monitoring application and which may trigger an alert or notification to the technician include but are not limited to the following 

In the examples above alert acknowledgments in response to out of tolerance alerts may take various forms. In one example the technician may acknowledge using the user interface for example by pushing a button flipping a switch or selecting a menu option depending on the type of user interface. Different user inputs buttons toggles menu selections etc. may have different meanings with respect to providing alert acknowledgments . Table 18 below shows an example of alert acknowledgments wherein as a non limiting example certain keys of a user interface of the locate receiver have certain meanings.

In another example a dropdown menu and or a set of icons that include the various types of alert acknowledgments such as shown in Table 18 may be presented on the display of the locate receiver. The user may then select the desired type of alert acknowledgment from the dropdown menu and or icons.

Also as mentioned above out of tolerance conditions and other conditions detected by the environmental and or operational sensors may be logged for example into alerts log irrespective of whether an alert is provided to the technician. Thus for any of the above described examples in which an alert may be generated a log of the detected condition may also or alternatively be made. Also other conditions than those described above may be logged.

Residing on central server may be business applications which may be any business applications that may be useful with respect to locate operations. In one example business applications may include a locate operations scoring application that processes information about locate operations and generates locate operations scores that may indicate the degree of quality of individual locate operations. Additionally SOP information may reside at central server and may be accessed by operations monitoring application and or any entity of locate operations system via network .

For example locate operations scoring application may be based on various embodiments of a quality assessment application as well as any one or more of the scoring criteria and or exemplary metrics disclosed in connection with such quality assessment applications as set forth in U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 493 109 filed Jun. 26 2009 entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF A FIELD SERVICE OPERATION and published as U.S. Patent Publication 2009 0327024 A1 which application is incorporated by reference herein. In particular a quality assessment application may be configured to receive a variety of information germane to locate and marking operations and compare such information to expected values or benchmarks metrics based on various criteria. A scoring algorithm implemented as part of some implementations of a quality assessment application may compare various input information e.g. field information as obtained from one or more pieces of locating equipment such as a locate receiver to the expected values or benchmarks to generate a quality assessment score in an automated fashion.

In another example business applications may include a ticket approval application that processes information about locate and marking operations and generates ticket approval outcomes that again may indicate the degree of quality of individual locate and marking operations. For example ticket approval application may be based on the ticket approval system that is described in U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 204 454 filed Sep. 4 2008 entitled TICKET APPROVAL SYSTEM FOR AND METHOD OF PERFORMING QUALITY CONTROL IN FIELD SERVICE APPLICATIONS and published as U.S. Patent Publication 2009 0204466 A1 which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference. This application describes a ticket approval system for and method of performing quality control QC in field service applications. The ticket approval system may include a work management server. The work management server may include a ticket approval software application and a database for storing digital ticket information such as field service site identification information manifest information and digital images of field service activities. A method of performing QC may include but is not limited to the field technician completing the ticket and providing data images an approver viewing and selecting a certain field technician and ticket for quality control review the approver reviewing data images of the selected ticket the approver approving the ticket the approver tagging the ticket for QC a QC approver processing QC referrals the QC approver routing the ticket to a QC technician the QC technician completing the QC tasks and updating the data images of the selected ticket the approver tagging the ticket for coaching the approver processing coaching referrals and the approver performing coaching tasks.

Network may be for example any local area network LAN and or wide area network WAN for connecting to the Internet. In one non limiting embodiment network provides the communication link between any and or all entities of locate operations system . For example network provides the communication network by which information may be exchanged between central server one or more onsite computers and or locating equipment e.g. locate receiver that are used by locate technicians in the field.

Onsite computers may be any computing devices that are capable of processing and executing program instructions. Onsite computers may be used by locate technicians that are performing locate and marking operations in the field. For example each onsite computer may be a portable computer a personal computer a tablet device a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular radiotelephone a mobile computing device a touch screen device a touchpad device or generally any device including or connected to a processor and a user interface. Preferably each onsite computer is a portable computing device such as laptop computer or tablet device. Onsite computers may be used by locate technicians to process locate request tickets not shown and to perform locate and marking operations accordingly.

Additionally operations monitoring application may be installed on onsite computers . For example operations monitoring application may be used to process information received from or transmitted to locate receiver . Each onsite computer may include a processing unit which may be any standard controller or microprocessor device that is capable of executing program instructions such as those from operations monitoring application . Each onsite computer may also include a quantity of memory which may be any data storage mechanism for storing any information that is processed locally at onsite computer . Processing unit and memory may be used for managing the overall operations of onsite computer .

Further each onsite computer may include a communication interface for connecting to network and or for communication with locating equipment. For example communication interface may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between any entities of locate operations system .

Operations monitoring application is used in locate operations system for detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment e.g. locate receiver in out of tolerance conditions as described above. For example operations algorithm of operations monitoring application determines whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions are present during locate operations and or whether violations of certain process tolerances are present during locate operations. Optionally operations monitoring application may be used to automatically enable and disable either electrically mechanically or both locating equipment in the field based on certain out of tolerance conditions being present.

Further locate operations system is not limited to the types and numbers of entities that are shown in . Any types and numbers of entities that may be useful in underground facilities locate applications may be included in locate operations system . More details of a method of detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment for out of tolerance conditions by use of locate operations system are described with reference to .

At step onsite computer or the locate receiver itself may detect powering up e.g. a power on state and or one more specific events e.g. docking de docking of a locate receiver one or more actuations error conditions technician interaction with a user interface etc. associated with a locate receiver such as locate receiver . Additionally the relevant SOP information is acquired. For example using location tracking system of locate receiver the geo location of the job work site may be determined. Based on this geo location information operations monitoring application automatically queries SOP information at central server for the SOP information of the regulatory body that corresponds to the location of the work site which is used to inform operating limits table of operations monitoring application .

Subsequently operations monitoring application at onsite computer may begin monitoring the environmental and or operating conditions associated with use of the locate receiver. For example operations algorithm of operations monitoring application begins monitoring sensor data that is returned from locate receiver and compares the contents of sensor data to information in operating limits table .

At decision step operations algorithm of operations monitoring application determines whether any out of tolerance conditions are present. For example if any one of the following out of tolerance conditions is present method may proceed to step . However if none of the following out of tolerance conditions are present method may proceed to step . The following out of tolerance conditions are exemplary only and not meant to be limiting.

At step operations monitoring application continues to monitor the conditions e.g. environmental and or operating of the locate receiver during locate operations. For example operations monitoring application at onsite computer continues to monitor the conditions of the locate receiver during locate operations by comparing the contents of sensor data to information in operating limits table . At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step .

At step operations monitoring application generates the corresponding out of tolerance alert logs the out of tolerance alert in alerts log and transmits the out of tolerance alert to the locating equipment such as to locate receiver in those embodiments in which the method is not entirely implemented on the locate receiver itself. By way of example the following out of tolerance alerts correspond respectively to the example out of tolerance conditions of step . The following out of tolerance alerts are exemplary only and not meant to be limiting. Also the below indicated alerts with respect to surface temperature and humidity may be applicable to scenarios in which a locate technician is both locating and marking a facility.

At step a certain alert acknowledgment may be returned to operations monitoring application . For example the user such as a certain locate technician may press a certain key of the user interface of the locate receiver and initiate the desired alert acknowledgment such as those shown above in Table 18. Once the alert acknowledgment is received at operations monitoring application it may be associated with its originating out of tolerance alert and logged in alerts log . Subsequently operations monitoring application continues to monitor the conditions of the locating equipment such as locate receiver . At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step and may optionally proceed to step .

Optionally method may include steps to disable locating equipment e.g. by disabling the actuation system the detection electronics or any other component of the locating equipment until or unless a certain out of tolerance condition is corrected. For example method may optionally include the following steps.

At optional decision step certain out of tolerance conditions may carry such importance that the suspension of locate operations is mandated e.g. disable actuations so as to impede the technician from continuing . One such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to temperature. Another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to humidity. Yet another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to lighting. Still another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to acceleration or velocity. Other out of tolerance conditions may also be sufficiently important to mandate suspending locate operations and those examples listed are non limiting. In these examples operations monitoring application may wait a certain amount of time e.g. 1 minute from the initial detection of the out of tolerance conditions and again acquire sensor data to determine whether the out of tolerance condition is still present or has been corrected. If the out of tolerance condition has been corrected method may proceed to step . However if the out of tolerance condition has not been corrected method may proceed to step .

At optional step the locate technician continues to perform locate operations and operations monitoring application continues to monitor the conditions of the locate receiver. At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step .

At optional step the locate receiver may be disabled. For example actuation system of locate receiver may be disabled to impede user acuations and or detection electronics may be disabled. The action to disable may be logged in alerts log .

At any time during the steps of method the contents of alerts log may be processed by business applications . In one example alerts log may be processed by locate operations scoring application and or ticket approval application for assessing the quality of locate and marking operations that are performed in the field assessing the skill and or competency levels of locate technicians and the like.

While illustrate some non limiting examples of manners in which data provided by environmental sensors and or operational sensors of a locate receiver may be used other uses are also possible. For example the data from environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used to trigger alerts or notifications to a technician irrespective of whether the sensed condition is outside tolerances. For example in some instances there may not be a specific tolerance for a given environmental or operational condition and yet an alert to the technician may be generated for the purpose of making the technician aware of whatever value the sensed condition has taken. Thus the generation of alerts notifications warnings based on sensed environmental and operational conditions is not limited to those instances in which the sensed condition takes any particular value s . Furthermore alerts may be generated based on conditions relating to dispensing of a marking material which may be applicable to scenarios in which a technician is both locating and marking a facility. For example sensed conditions with respect to ambient temperature surface temperature and or humidity among others may impact dispensing of a marking material and thus alerts notifications may be presented to the technician to indicate whether conditions are appropriate for or adverse to dispensing of a marking material. Also as previously explained the alert notification signal s described herein may take any suitable form s such as an audible alert a chime a ring tone a verbal message or command e.g. synthesized speech provided by a text to speech synthesizer of the locate receiver etc. a visual alert e.g. a text display for example in those embodiments in which the locate receiver includes a display an indicator light etc. a tactile indication any combination of those options or any other suitable type of notification.

Also it should be appreciated that information from one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used more generally to control or alter operation of the locate receiver. For example one or more components of the locate receiver may be activated enabled or disabled or the functionality thereof controlled or altered in some manner in response to one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors providing environmental information and or operational information indicative that such control should be exhibited. Such activation enablement and or disablement may be electrical in nature e.g. providing power or an enable signal triggering operation of a sensor etc. mechanical in nature e.g. causing a locking mechanism to be engaged on the actuation system or both. For example if the sensed inclination of the locate receiver as sensed by inclinometer is unsuitable for locating the actuation system and or detection electronics may be disabled. Similarly if the acceleration as sensed by accelerometer is out of tolerance with accepted practices the actuation system and or detection electronics may be disabled. If a sensed condition is out of tolerance the operation of one of the environmental and or operational sensors may be altered for example by altering the sampling rate to collect more or less data. According to one embodiment the sampling rate of a location tracking system of the locate receiver may be increased in response to an out of tolerance heading detected by the compass of the locate receiver. According to another embodiment the sampling rate of the location tracking system may be increased in response to the location tracking system detecting an out of tolerance location. Other control actions are also possible and the aspects described herein relating to controlling the locate receiver in response to sensing environmental and or operational conditions are not limited in the types of actions that may be taken or the sensed conditions which may trigger action alteration.

Furthermore the determination of whether a condition or multiple conditions are out of tolerance whether to generate an alert or notification to a technician or whether to control alter some functionality of the locate receiver based at least in part on environmental and or operational information may be made in any suitable manner. For instance as illustrated in some of the foregoing examples such a determination may be made by comparison of a single value from a sensor to an expected or target value. Alternatively outputs from the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be monitored for changes e.g. any change or by some predetermined amount rather than for a particular single value. For example a change in temperature or a change in light may initiate generation of an alert rather than a single temperature or light value.

In addition information provided by one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be monitored and analyzed to detect patterns. For example information provided by the operational sensors may be used to formulate and assess patterns of operation of a particular technician which may be thought of as technician signatures. As an example a particular technician may have a characteristic motion when performing a locate operation such as when sweeping over a buried facility or may perform the operation at a characteristic speed. Assessing information provided by the one or more accelerometers for example may allow for determination of the unique characteristic. Once determined information from the operational sensors on future jobs may allow for identification of the technician based on the unique characteristic and may also be used to assess whether the technician is operating in his her normal manner or whether he she is deviating from his her usual operation which may suggest that the technician was doing something out of the ordinary and which accordingly may cause generation of an alert notification and or alteration of the locate receiver. Such information therefore may be used for quality control and or for training purposes of technicians. Similarly such operating information from multiple technicians may be used to develop standard operating guidelines or protocols.

It should be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that information provided by two or more of the environmental sensors may be used in combination for example to assess the environmental conditions to interact with the technician e.g. generate an alert and or to control alter operation of the locate receiver e.g. disable or enable actuation of the locate receiver . As a non limiting example the sensed ambient temperature in combination with the sensed humidity may provide information about whether a particular form of precipitation is present e.g. snow rain etc. in response to which an alert may be generated and or one or more components of the locate receiver may be enabled or disabled e.g. the actuation system may be disabled . Non limiting examples of useful combinations of environmentally sensed conditions include ambient temperature humidity surface temperature humidity ambient temperature surface temperature ambient temperature light sensor light image capture light audio capture and ambient temperature humidity light. However it should be appreciated that other combinations are also possible.

It should also be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that information provided by two or more of the operational sensors may be used in combination for example to assess the operational conditions of a locate receiver to interact with the technician to assess determine and or analyze technician signatures associated with device use manipulation and or to control or alter operation of the locate receiver e.g. to disable actuation of the locate receiver enable actuation of the locate receiver etc. . Non limiting examples of useful combinations of sensed operational conditions which may be used for any of the purposes described above include acceleration of locate receiver proximity of locate receiver to surface proximity of locate receiver to surface inclination of locate receiver acceleration heading geo location heading acceleration and geo location acceleration inclination. However it should be appreciated that other combinations are also possible.

Furthermore according to one embodiment information provided by one or more environmental sensors may be used in combination with information provided by one or more operational sensors for example to assess the quality of the locate operation to interact with the technician to assess determine and or analyze technician signatures associated with device use manipulation and or to control or alter operation of the locate receiver e.g. disable or enable actuation of the locate receiver . For example information about ambient light level sensed by a light sensor may be used in combination with acceleration data from an accelerometer as for example it may be preferable in some embodiments for a technician to move more slowly in low light conditions. Other combinations of sensor information may also be useful depending on a particular application.

As previously explained the locate receivers described herein may be used in different modes examples of which include locate mode and landmark mode. In addition locate receivers according to one aspect of the present invention may be operated in a so called solo mode or a so called group mode. 

For some locate operations a single technician may be present at the jobsite and may complete the locate operation. Thus any locate data collected relating to the job may be solely from the technician s locate receiver and may not need to be combined with locate data from any other locate receivers. In such situations the locate receiver may be operated as an individual independent locate receiver in solo mode. As described above data collected by the locate receiver may be stored locally and or transmitted to a host server such as remote computer .

For certain types of underground facility locate operations multiple locate technicians may be working on a same locate ticket simultaneously. When this occurs it may be advantageous for some or all of the locate receivers that are used during performance of the ticketed job to consolidate data such as by providing data to a host server. This may be accomplished through the use of a group mode of operation of the locate receivers. In group mode a locate receiver may act as a worker device and may not be capable of transmitting its collected locate data to a remote computer. For example the wireless transmission capability of the locate receiver may be disabled in group mode. Rather the locate data may be cached in local memory of the locate receiver or may be transmitted to another locate receiver which may act as a leader device receiving the collected locate data from the other locate receivers used for the locate operation. The leader locate receiver may then transmit the collected locate information to a remote computer or may handle the collected information in any suitable manner.

Selection of solo mode and group mode may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example selection between these two modes may be facilitated by any suitable combination of hardware and or software on the locate receiver. For example the locate receiver may include mode controller software for selecting the operating mode of the locate receiver. According to one embodiment the user interface of the locate receiver may include a toggle switch for toggling between solo mode and group mode. Alternatively the locate receiver may present the technician with a menu on a graphical display of user interface from which the technician may choose the desired mode. Other schemes for allowing selection of solo mode and group mode are also possible.

According to some embodiments it may be desirable to know the location of the tip of the locate receiver as for example the tip may be the portion of the locate receiver located in close proximity to the ground when a locate technician sweeps the locate receiver over the ground to detect a buried facility. Thus for example determining the motion of the tip of the locate receiver may allow for assessment of technician manipulation of the locate receiver which may be used for quality control training purposes and standard setting among other things. Thus according to another aspect of the present invention methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of the tip of a locate receiver. However it should be appreciated that the tip of the locate receiver is a non limiting example of a specific point of interest of a locate receiver for which it may be desirable to know the location as for example other portions of the locate receiver may be of interest in other embodiments. The methods and apparatus described herein may be applied equally well to the determination of any point of interest on the locate receiver.

One approach for determining the location of the tip of the locate receiver e.g. tip shown in or any other point of interest on the locate receiver is to place a location tracking system at that point. Thus according to one embodiment a locate receiver such as any of the locate receivers described previously herein or any other locate receiver may include a location tracking system as discussed in other embodiments e.g. a GPS receiver wherein the location tracking system is disposed at or sufficiently near the tip of the locate receiver allowing for determination of the location of the tip of the locate receiver. Thus the location tracking system may provide the geo location of the tip of the locate receiver which as mentioned may be useful for a variety of reasons. For example the geo location information provided by the location tracking system may be used to record the motion of the tip of the locate receiver which may be used for detection of out of tolerance operation of the locate receiver determination of operating patterns of technicians or for various other purposes.

While the above described embodiment provides a location tracking system positioned at the point of interest on the locate receiver such positioning of a location tracking system may not always be possible or advantageous. For example as explained previously herein in some embodiments the operation of the location tracking system may be facilitated by positioning the location tracking system toward the top of the locate receiver for example if the location tracking system is a GPS receiver. However as mentioned it may be desirable in some embodiments to determine the location of the tip of the locate receiver or any other point of interest of the locate receiver which in some situations will not correspond to the top of the locate receiver. Thus according to one embodiment methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of a point of interest of a locate receiver when a location tracking system is located at a different point on the locate receiver. For simplicity of explanation the following examples will be discussed assuming that a location tracking system is located near the top of the locate receiver and that the point of interest of the locate receiver is the tip of the locate receiver. It should be appreciated that the described apparatus and techniques may apply equally well to other positions of the location tracking system and points of interest on the locate receiver.

To facilitate the following discussion it is useful to first consider the physical configuration at issue for determining the location of the tip of the locate receiver when the location tracking system is located at or near the top of the locate receiver. For this purpose the locate receiver may be represented in simplified form as an elongated rod or stick. illustrates a perspective view of such a simplified representation of a locate receiver shown as locate receiver .

In the x y plane represents the ground and the z direction represents the vertical direction perpendicular to the ground. The point P may be the location of a location tracking system e.g. a GPS receiver and in some embodiments may correspond generally to the top of the locate receiver for example near where the technician may hold the locate receiver if it is a handheld device. The point P represents the point of interest of the locate receiver and in this non limiting example corresponds generally to the tip of the locate receiver. The point P may be assumed to be at ground level i.e. in the x y plane z 0 for purposes of simplicity except as described below in those embodiments in which the distance of P from the x y plane may be measured. The shortest distance between P and P is given by L which in some embodiments may correspond to the length of the locate receiver although not all embodiments are limited in this respect. For example if the locate receiver has a non linear shape the distance L may not correspond to the length of the locate receiver. The locate receiver may be projected onto the x y plane z 0 along the dashed line which therefore lies in the x y plane. The distance between the points P and P in the x y plane i.e. along the dashed line is represented by d. The distance between the point P and ground is given by H i.e. z H . At any given time the locate receiver may make an angle with respect to the x y plane i.e. with respect to ground in this non limiting example. The projection of the locate receiver on the x y plane i.e. along the line may be at an angle in the x y plane with respect to the x axis. In some embodiments the x axis may be defined to align with true North although all embodiments are not limited in this respect.

According to one embodiment a locate receiver such as locate receiver may comprise a location tracking system at the point P. The location tracking system may provide the geo location of the point P with respect to the x y plane represented as GPS. The geo location of P in the x y plane may be represented by GPS . As will be explained GPS may be determined based on a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and determination of suitable combinations of L d H and . The value of L may be known before the locate operation begins for example since it may be set after manufacture of the locate receiver. The values of d H and may be directly sensed during operation of the locate receiver or may be calculated using suitable ones of the operational sensors as will be described below.

According to one embodiment the geo location of the tip of a locate receiver such as locate receiver may be determined using the value of GPSgiven by the location tracking system at P and accelerometer data from an accelerometer positioned at or sufficiently near the tip of the locate receiver i.e. at point P in . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The accelerometer in this non limiting embodiment is a 3 axis accelerometer. By suitable analysis of the acceleration values for each axis using known algorithms the angle that the locate receiver makes with the ground may be determined see e.g. the previous discussion of how to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer as described by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Based on the known distance L and the determined angle the distance d between GPSand GPS in the x y plane may be calculated using the fact that the cosine of is equal to d L .

Once the distance d is known the value of GPS may be derived from GPSif the angle is known since may provide the direction from GPSto GPS again in some embodiments the x axis may be aligned with or taken as true North such that may represent an angle with respect to true North . The value of may be determined in one of several manners. One manner for determining is from the readout of a compass of the locate receiver such as previously described compass . If the location tracking system providing GPSis a GPS receiver then the value of may alternatively be taken from the heading information provided as part of the NMEA data stream provided by the GPS receiver. A third alternative for determining is to calculate a direction of motion based on multiple GPS points taken from the location tracking system. According to this third alternative multiple GPS points taken at different times may be used to calculate a direction of motion by for example determining the direction indicated by a straight line connecting the multiple GPS points. Other methods for determining are also possible as these are non limiting examples. Once is known the value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and . Once GPS is determined it may be used instead of GPS or in addition to GPS as more accurate geo location data which may be included for example in one or more event entries and or electronic records as discussed above.

According to an alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing an inclinometer on the locate receiver such as inclinometer previously described. The inclinometer may provide the value of . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. Thus the value of d may be determined using L and as explained above. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and as noted above.

According to another embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing a proximity sensor such as previously described proximity sensor . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The proximity sensor may be positioned at P and configured to measure the value of H. Assuming that the point P is at or very near the ground i.e. having a vertical height of approximately zero the value of H and the known distance L of the locate receiver may be used to determine d for example using the Pythagorean theorem. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

As explained the above described example in which a single proximity sensor is used to determine the value of H may provide suitable results when it is assumed that the point P has zero vertical height. In one embodiment that assumption may be avoided by also including a proximity sensor at the point P and configured to measure the distance between P and the ground. Then the difference in height between P and P rather than the value of H may be used in connection with the known distance L to determine the distance d e.g. using the Pythagorean Theorem . The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

According to a further alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing two 3 axis accelerometers on the locate receiver. One accelerometer may be located at the point P on the locate receiver while the second may be located at the point P. Using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety the location of P relative to P may be determined.

As mentioned in some instances it may be desirable to track the motion of a specific portion of a locate receiver such as the tip of the locate receiver for any one of the reasons previously described. In those embodiments in which the locate receiver includes a location tracking system providing a value of GPSfor a different point on the locate receiver than the point of interest the tracking of the point of interest may be performed by determining GPS the location of the point of interest for each value of GPSas the locate receiver is moved using any of the above described techniques.

However in some instances the value of GPSprovided by the location tracking system may not have sufficient accuracy to allow for a desired level of accuracy in tracking the motion at the desired point on the locate receiver e.g. the point P . For example when performing a locate operation a technician may move the locate receiver by distances that are relatively small compared to the resolution of the location tracking system. For example when sweeping the locate receiver over the ground the sweeping pattern may include segments smaller than the resolution of the location tracking system e.g. smaller than approximately 30 inches in some embodiments . In such instances using the above described techniques for determining GPS as the point P moves may not sufficiently capture the movement with a desired resolution. Thus the techniques described below may be used.

According to one embodiment the motion of the point P may be tracked by using any of the above described techniques to get an initial value of GPS and then using data from an accelerometer at the point P to determine the distance traveled in the x and y directions. This technique is commonly referred to in the relevant arts as dead reckoning. In this embodiment the accelerometer may provide acceleration data for the x and y axes. That data may be integrated twice to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions thus giving the position of P at any point in time relative to any initial GPS value. Alternatively the accelerometer may output velocity data for each axis which may be integrated to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions. A specific example is now described with respect to .

The pattern of motion comprises lines . The solid lines in correspond to when the actuation system of the locate receiver e.g. actuation system is activated. Lines and described below are shown as dashed lines because the actuation system is not actuated as the locate receiver traversed the paths indicated by those lines.

The making of the pattern of motion by a locate receiver may be determined as follows. First the technician may begin the pattern at the point R at which time the technician actuates the actuation system e.g. to record magnetic field data . The location of point R may correspond to the initial location of the tip of the locate receiver and therefore may be determined from a value of GPSof the top of the locate receiver and any of the above described techniques for determining the location of the tip relative to the location of the top of the locate receiver.

The technician may then begin to move the locate receiver along the path indicated by line ending at the point R. The motion of the tip of the locate receiver along line may be determined from the output of an accelerometer at the tip of the locate receiver providing an output signal for both the x and y directions. According to one embodiment the output of the accelerometer is velocity data for both the x and y axes and is output periodically for example twice per second although higher and lower data output rates are possible. The velocity values for each of the x and y axes may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer e.g. one half of a second in this non limiting example to get the distance traveled in the x and y directions from the initial point R. Alternatively the total velocity of the locate receiver may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer and the direction of motion may be determined by comparing the velocity values for the x and y axes to each other e.g. by taking the ratio of the velocity along the x axis to the velocity along the y axis. Either way the distance travelled in the x and y directions may be determined.

In the non limiting example of the first line i.e. line may serve as a base line or reference line from which the angle of subsequent motions may be referenced. Thus in the angle of the second motion of the technician from points R to R along the path indicated by line may be determined by reference to the direction of line since the accelerometer output will indicate a change from the motion along the path of line . The distance and direction of the line may be determined as described above for line . Again the line is shown as a dashed line as the actuation system of the locate receiver is not activated while the locate receiver traverses the illustrated path.

The locate receiver is subsequently moved along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R along line from point R to R along line from point R to R and finally along line from point R back to point R . The length and relative direction of each of the indicated lines may be determined as described above for line

Thus it should be appreciated that according to this non limiting embodiment a value of GPSprovided by a location tracking system is used only to determine the initial location of R after which the locations of point R R are determined using dead reckoning.

Also it should be appreciated that while the relative orientation of each of the indicated lines is determined from the dead reckoning techniques described the absolute or actual orientation is not determined from the accelerometer data since the actual orientation of line is not determined from the accelerometer data. Thus according to one embodiment an additional step of determining an actual orientation of the line may be performed. According to one non limiting embodiment the actual orientation of line may be given by a heading provided by a compass of the locate receiver while the line is made. Other techniques may alternatively be used to determine the actual direction of the first motion of the pattern of motion.

According to the above described embodiment the location of the tip of a locate receiver may be determined by determining an initial location using a location tracking system and subsequently using the dead reckoning techniques described. Because the error associated with dead reckoning may increase as the distance traversed increases it may be desirable in some embodiments to reset the dead reckoning by determining a new initial location value using a location tracking system. For example referring to the pattern of motion in one embodiment the location of R may be determined from a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and any of the techniques described for determining a value of GPS for the given GPS. Subsequently dead reckoning may be used to determine the paths of lines and . According to one embodiment the location of point R is not determined from dead reckoning but rather may be determined by getting a value of GPSat the point R and calculating a corresponding value of GPS . Then dead reckoning may be used to determine the locations of lines . In this manner location errors that accumulate using dead reckoning may be minimized or eliminated.

Accordingly it should be understood that a new initial location point serving as a starting point for the use of dead reckoning may be set at any suitable intervals during a locate operation. Suitable criteria for determining when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning include setting a new initial point for the beginning of each new motion of a pattern that a technician makes e.g. each new sweeping segment of a sweeping pattern for each new pattern for each new locate job or every time the dead reckoning data indicates a threshold total distance has been traveled e.g. 5 meters 10 meters 50 meters or any other threshold value . This list is not exhaustive as other criteria may also be used to determine when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning.

According to one aspect of the present invention a locate receiver may include an enhanced user interface with tactile functionality. As will be described the tactile functionality may be provided in one or more of various locations on the locate receiver and may be used for various purposes.

The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the handle of the locate receiver or otherwise mechanically coupled to the handle . The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the joystick or is otherwise mechanically coupled to the joystick . The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the actuator or otherwise mechanically coupled to the actuator . It should be appreciated that locate receivers including tactile indicators according to the embodiments described herein are not limited to having any particular number of tactile indicators i.e. one or more and are not limited in the locations at which the tactile indicators are placed.

The tactile indicators may be of any suitable type. One example of a suitable type of tactile indicator is that used in cellular telephones to provide the vibrate functionality. According to one embodiment one or more of the tactile indicators is formed by a flywheel that has a weight configured to unbalance the flywheel so that when the flywheel spins it wobbles. According to one embodiment all three of the tactile indicators are the same type although not all embodiments are limited in this respect.

The tactile indicators may provide any suitable type of tactile indication to a technician in terms of duration frequency intensity pattern and any combinations thereof. Also the tactile indicators need not provide the same type of tactile indication. For example tactile indicator may provide a relatively strong continuous vibration of long duration whereas tactile indicator may provide a series of low intensity short vibrations. Furthermore one or more of the tactile indicators may be configurable to provide multiple different types of tactile indications. For example in some instances the tactile indicator may provide a long continuous vibration whereas in other instances the tactile indicator may provide a short vibration. Thus the type s of tactile indication presented by the tactile indicators is not limiting.

According to one embodiment the tactile indications provided to a user may have different meanings. According to one embodiment the meaning may differ depending on the tactile indicator providing the tactile indication. For example vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate the locate receiver power supply is low while vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate the technician has tried to select an invalid entry for a menu displayed on display and vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate that the actuator is not functioning. According to one embodiment different meanings may be conveyed by a single tactile indicator. For example a short vibration of tactile indicator may indicate the locate receiver power supply is low while a longer duration vibration of tactile indicator may indicate for example that the locate receiver is not at the correct job location for example as may be determined by a location tracking system of the locate receiver. Thus it should be appreciated that the tactile indicators may be used to convey various messages to the technician.

According to one aspect of the present invention one or more of the tactile indicators may operate in response to information collected by an environmental sensor and or operational sensor of the locate receiver. For example as described above e.g. in connection with some embodiments of the present invention provide an alert or notification to the locate receiver technician if an out of tolerance condition is detected based on a condition sensed by an environmental or operational sensor. As explained the alerts may take any suitable form including visual and or audible. In addition or alternatively the alerts may be presented via one or more of the tactile indicators. For example the tactile indicator may vibrate if an out of tolerance condition is detected that would be adverse to performance of the locate operation.

According to one embodiment the nature of operation of each of the tactile indicators in in terms of what triggers vibration of the tactile indicator the type of vibration intensity duration frequency pattern etc. and the meaning may be controlled by the control electronics . For example the nature of operation of each of the tactile indicators may be programmed into a processor of the control electronics e.g. similar to processor previously described .

In one example the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator may be associated with the general operation of locate receiver and or aspects of the locate operations. In other words conditions associated with the general operation of locate receiver and or aspects of the locate operations are communicated to the user via tactile sensations at handle . In this example tactile sensations provided at handle may be used to indicate any events that may occur on and or any conditions of the locate receiver. Examples of tactile sensations that are provided at handle by tactile indicator may include but are not limited to the following 

In one embodiment the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator at the joystick may be associated with user interface functions. In other words when the user is using the joystick or buttons to navigate through menus on display tactile feedback to the user at the joystick may be used to communicate for example a validation of certain selections or user interface functions. Examples of tactile sensations that may be provided at joystick via tactile indicator may include but are not limited to the following 

In one embodiment the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator at the actuator may be associated with operation of the actuator . Examples of tactile sensations that may be provided via tactile indicator include but are not limited to the following 

Tactile sensations may also be generated based on information received from one or more sources external to the locate receiver such as but not limited to external systems external networks external computing devices external business applications and external instrumentation among others. For example the locate receiver e.g. locate receiver may be in communication with one or more external devices such as remote computer via a network. The network may be for example a local area network LAN and or a wide area network WAN . The control electronics may be programmed to generate tactile sensations via one or more of tactile indicators based on information received from the remote computer .

Thus further examples of scenarios which may trigger generation of a tactile sensation via any one or more of the tactile indicators may include but are not limited to the following 

It should be appreciated that information about the generation of a tactile signal may be included in an electronic record a message or any other source of information including the other locate information described herein. For example information about whether a tactile signal was generated which tactile indicator generated the signal the type of signal e.g. duration frequency intensity etc. the cause of the signal the time of the signal e.g. from a timestamp and or the geo location at which the signal was issued may be recorded among other things.

Table 19 illustrates an example of an event entry that may be made in response to actuation of an actuation system of a locate receiver in which the locate receiver includes a tactile indicator. The illustrated event entry is similar to that of Table 12 shown and described previously with the addition of an indication of whether a tactile signal was generated e.g. a yes or no indication being represented by Y and N for TCTL . Information from one or more input devices other components of the locate receiver is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

Table 20 illustrates an example of a data record that may be generated by a locate receiver including a tactile indicator as well as various environmental and operational sensors. As shown the data record may include a yes no indication of whether a tactile signal was generated as well as information about the type of signal. It should be appreciated that other forms for the data are possible and that other information regarding the tactile indicator may be included such as any of the types of information described above.

In those embodiments in which a locate receiver includes both a tactile indicator and at least one accelerometer data from the accelerometer s may be used to verify whether a tactile indication was generated as the accelerometer data may reflect any physical movement of the locate receiver including the physical vibrations caused by a tactile indicator. Thus referring again to Table 20 for example the acceleration data may provide verification that the indicated tactile signal was in fact generated.

As shown the locate transmitter includes a body having a handle . The locate transmitter includes a power source which may be and function substantially the same as previously described power source . Also the locate transmitter includes control electronics which may be similar to or substantially the same as previously described control electronics . For example the control electronics may include a processor a local memory a timing system a location tracking system a user interface and a communication interface one or more of which may be substantially the same as the corresponding components of control electronics . The locate transmitter also includes an applied signal output for providing an applied signal along a facility.

Furthermore the locate transmitter includes a tactile indicator in on or otherwise mechanically coupled to the handle . The tactile indicator may be substantially the same as any of the tactile indicators described in connection with . Thus the tactile indicator may vibrate or otherwise provide a tactile indication to a technician. The tactile indication may be of any suitable type in terms of pattern intensity and duration. Moreover the tactile indicator may be configured to provide multiple different types of tactile indications for example with the different types having different meanings. The type and meaning of a tactile indication provided by tactile indicator may be in one embodiment programmed or otherwise controlled by a processor of the control electronics in the same manner as that described above with respect to tactile indicators being controlled at least in part by the processor .

The tactile indicator may be triggered in response to one of various conditions such as those previously described with respect to tactile indicators that are applicable in the context of locate transmitters. For example out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions may trigger the tactile indicator . Events relating to the general operation of the locate transmitter may trigger a tactile indication such as but not limited to 

Information received from external sources e.g. a remote device such as a remote computer may trigger the tactile indicator . For example any of the above described types of information possibly received by locate receiver may similarly be received by locate transmitter and may trigger a tactile sensation e.g. checklist information SOP information wage and hour information quality assessment information VWL information facilities maps information and or information about prior locate operations among others . Thus any of the following types of alerts may be generated via tactile indicator 

It should be appreciated that the examples described above with respect to the types of tactile indications which may generated by tactile indicator their causes and their meanings are not limiting but rather are provided for purposes of illustration. Other causes of tactile indications are possible as are other types of tactile indications. Furthermore while illustrates a single tactile indicator not all embodiments of a locate transmitter having a tactile indicator are limited in this manner. For example a locate transmitter may have one or more tactile indicators according to various embodiments described herein.

Furthermore electronic records and event entries may be generated based on operation of the locate transmitter which records and entries may include an indication of whether a tactile signal was generated and if so what kind at what time at what location and whether it was acknowledged among other things. Thus entries and records such as those of Tables 19 and 20 may be generated in the context of the locate transmitter .

It should be appreciated that many of the aspects of the present invention described above also apply to a combination locate and marking device. As explained a locate receiver is a device typically used to locate an underground facility after which the location may be marked using a marking device. According to one embodiment a single device may perform the function of a locate receiver and a marking device and thus may be a combination locate and marking device as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 569 192 filed on Sep. 29 2009 and titled Methods Apparatus and Systems For Generating Electronic Records Of Locate And Marking Operations And Combined Locate And Marking Apparatus For Same which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The various aspects described herein relating to locate receivers may also apply to such combination locate and marking devices as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 569 192.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a locate transmitter includes an enhanced ground probe for determining one or more characteristics of the ground or other material into which it is inserted. When using a locate transmitter in a conductive mode of operation the transmitter may be suitably electrically grounded by connecting to a ground stake for example a metal rod inserted into the ground. The quality of the electrical grounding may depend on characteristics of the ground into which the stake is inserted such as the moisture content iron content soil type e.g. sandy clay etc. and pH among others. Accordingly one embodiment of the present invention provides one or more ground probes for grounding a locate transmitter that also measures one or more of moisture content pH or other characteristics of interest of the ground. illustrates a non limiting example.

The locate transmitter of may be substantially similar to previously described locate transmitter and thus includes some of the same reference numbers. In addition locate transmitter includes a signal lead e.g. a wire terminating with a clamp for clamping to a connection point of a target facility. The signal lead which is connected to the applied signal output provides the applied signal to the target facility. The locate transmitter also includes a ground lead terminating with one or more ground probe . The ground probe may be configured to be inserted into the physical ground to establish an electrical ground connection for the locate transmitter .

The one or more ground probes may each be configured to sense one or more of moisture content iron content soil type and pH of the ground into which it is inserted using techniques known to those of skill in the art. The sensed information may be provided to control electronics e.g. a processor or memory of the control electronics for storage in an electronic record processing transmission to an external device e.g. remote computer or any of the other uses of information described herein. According to one embodiment an alert may be generated to a technician using the locate transmitter if the sensed moisture and or pH indicate an out of tolerance condition e.g. a condition not suitable for making a good electrical ground. According to one embodiment the locate transmitter may be disabled e.g. any applied signal may be inhibited in response to detecting such a condition. Other actions may also be taken in response to detecting such a condition according to the various aspects described herein.

It should be appreciated that locate transmitters including a ground probe of the type illustrated in need not include tactile indicators or the other features of the locate transmitter . Rather the locate transmitter represents a non limiting example only.

According to another embodiment it may desirable to know a distance between the body of a locate transmitter the connection point e.g. clamp for connecting to a facility and the connection point to electrical ground e.g. to a ground stake . For example there may be recommended distances between the ground connection point e.g. the location of a ground stake or ground probe the body of the transmitter and the point at which the transmitter connects to the target facility. Referring to as a non limiting example there may be preferred distances between the body the clamp when clamped and the ground probe when inserted into the ground or other material . Deviation from such preferred distances may result in electrical interference compromising the quality of an applied signal or otherwise degrading performance of the locate transmitter. Thus according to one embodiment of the present invention apparatus and methods are provided for determining the distances between such components.

According to a first embodiment the distances between a locate transmitter body a connection point of the locate transmitter to a target facility and a ground connection point e.g. the location of a ground stake may be determined by providing a location tracking system e.g. a GPS receiver as previously described for each of the points of interest. For example referring to each of the body clamp and ground probe may include a GPS receiver. Thus the distances between the components may be determined from the GPS data provided by the GPS receivers.

According to another embodiment the distances between the components may be determined using a landmark mode of the locate transmitter or of a locate receiver. For example as previously explained landmark mode functionality may allow for recording of geo location information of landmarks of interest. According to one embodiment a locate receiver with landmark mode functionality may be used to record the geo location of each of the body clamp and ground from which the distances between the components may be determined. Alternatively the locate transmitter itself may have landmark mode functionality and may be used to determined the geo location of the components of interest.

According to a further embodiment a locate transmitter may include one or more proximity sensors which may be used to determine the distances between components. For example the locate transmitter may include a proximity sensor which may be implemented to measure a distance between the body and the ground probe . Similarly the distance between the body and the clamp may be determined with the proximity sensor.

Other manners of determining the distances between a locate transmitter a connection point to a target facility and an electrical ground connection point are also possible as the above described examples are non limiting. Furthermore while the foregoing description references the locate transmitter as an example it should be appreciated that the techniques may be applied to various types of locate transmitters and that for example the locate transmitter need not include a probe like ground problem for measuring characteristics of the ground.

Information about the distances between the locate transmitter body the electrical ground connection point and the connection point to the target facility may be used in any of the manners previously described for other types of locate related information. According to one embodiment the information may be recorded in an electronic record. According to another embodiment an alert may be generated and provided to a technician using the locate transmitter if the determined distances do not satisfactorily compare to pre determined or accepted values. For example if the distances are too short e.g. indicating the possibility of electrical interference an alert may be generated. Moreover according to one embodiment the locate transmitter may be disabled e.g. generation of the applied signal may be inhibited if the measured distances do not satisfactorily compare to pre determined or accepted values. Other types of responses are also possible as those listed are non limiting examples.

As discussed herein a wide variety of information data may be acquired and analyzed in connection with locate operations for a variety of purposes. The data of interest that may be acquired and analyzed may include but is not limited to timestamp data geo location information of detected facilities geo location information of environmental landmarks direction information any information included in the standard data stream of the locate tracking system e.g. GPS system color type of detected facilities ID information e.g. individual vehicle wage and or hour compliance battery status of the locate device wired wireless connection status Bluetooth signal strength storage capacity of the local memory temperature humidity light level movement of the locate device mode of operation of the locate device charging state of the locate device e.g. charging not charging alerts against expectations in performance and any combination thereof.

The information such as shown in various tables herein that may be acquired by use of the data acquisition system and methods described herein may be used for any purpose. In an embodiment the information of the data acquisition system may be analyzed against expected locate operations in order to gain benefits in for example operating efficiency personnel management inventory management quality control training operations safety customer satisfaction and the like.

Additionally the information that is acquired by use of the data acquisition system and the methods of the present disclosure may be correlated to other aspects of locate and marking operations. For example the locate device data streams e.g. respective event entries or one or more electronic records transmitted by the locate device may be correlated to other data streams of multiple locate devices or any other devices in order to aggregate assess evaluate draw insights from take action on this information and any combination thereof. Correlating disparate data streams may be useful in order to better interpret and or gain new interpretations that are useful. For example by analyzing the aggregated data field service providers may gain visibility into the distributed workforce may take corrective and or any other constructive action to improve process management may improve and or develop best practices and any combination thereof. In an embodiment certain trends may be identified by correlating historical records of the amount of time that is spent performing locate and marking operations to other information such as but not limited to the time of day time of year address of the locate site experience of the locate technician weather conditions heavy or light traffic times and the like.

All definitions as defined and used herein should be understood to control over dictionary definitions definitions in documents incorporated by reference and or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.

The indefinite articles a and an as used herein in the specification and in the claims unless clearly indicated to the contrary should be understood to mean at least one. 

The phrase and or as used herein in the specification and in the claims should be understood to mean either or both of the elements so conjoined i.e. elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with and or should be construed in the same fashion i.e. one or more of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the and or clause whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus as a non limiting example a reference to A and or B when used in conjunction with open ended language such as comprising can refer in one embodiment to A only optionally including elements other than B in another embodiment to B only optionally including elements other than A in yet another embodiment to both A and B optionally including other elements etc.

For example when separating items in a list or or and or shall be interpreted as being inclusive i.e. the inclusion of at least one but also including more than one of a number or list of elements and optionally additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary such as only one of or exactly one of or when used in the claims consisting of will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general the term or as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives i.e. one or the other but not both when preceded by terms of exclusivity such as either one of only one of or exactly one of. Consisting essentially of when used in the claims shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.

As used herein in the specification and in the claims the phrase at least one in reference to a list of one or more elements should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase at least one refers whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus as a non limiting example at least one of A and B or equivalently at least one of A or B or equivalently at least one of A and or B can refer in one embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one A with no B present and optionally including elements other than B in another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one B with no A present and optionally including elements other than A in yet another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one A and at least one optionally including more than one B and optionally including other elements etc.

In the claims as well as in the specification above all transitional phrases such as comprising including carrying having containing involving holding composed of and the like are to be understood to be open ended i.e. to mean including but not limited to.
