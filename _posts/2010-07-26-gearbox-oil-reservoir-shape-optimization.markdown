This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 06 C 0081 awarded by the United States Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

This application relates to an oil reservoir for a gearbox wherein the shape is optimized to ensure adequate oil flow even when a vehicle carrying the gearbox is put through extreme changes in orientation.

Modern aircraft and in particular helicopters must be able to perform a variety of extreme maneuvers. They must be able to have nose up and nose down and left and right inclination attitudes. In addition the attitudes may be combined between nose up down and left right inclination.

One component that is typically mounted on modern helicopters is an APU or auxiliary power unit. An APU is a small gas turbine engine which generates electrical power. The APU includes a gear train mounted in a gear housing. The gear train is provided with a lubrication system including a lube pump moving oil from an oil reservoir across the gear train.

An inlet tube takes oil from the reservoir and delivers it to the pump. The extreme changes in attitude that can occur with the use of such a system on a helicopter raise challenges with ensuring there is an adequate oil level to supply oil into the inlet tube. On the other hand it is also important to not have too high an oil level. Typically a designer would not want the gear train to be immersed in the oil.

A gearbox for use in an auxiliary power unit has a plurality of gears and bearings received within a housing. A lube pump is mounted within the housing and delivers oil to the plurality of gears and bearings. The lube pump has an oil supply inlet tube for supplying oil to the pump for delivery to the plurality of gears and bearings. An oil reservoir maintains a quantity of oil above a lowermost end of the inlet tube and is shaped such that a cross sectional area at a lower end of the inlet tube has a first cross sectional area much smaller than that of the second. Other cross sectional areas spaced upwardly from the first cross sectional area are greater. A ratio of the second cross sectional area to the first cross sectional area is less than 3.

These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings the following of which is a brief description.

Referring to a rotary wing aircraft includes a main rotor system an airframe and an extended tail . The extended tail supports an anti torque system . The main rotor system is driven about an axis A by multiple power plants ENG ENG and ENG. The power plants ENG ENG and ENG generate the power for flight operations and the APU provides power utilized for operating various aircraft systems. Although a particular aircraft and power plant configuration is illustrated other aircraft configurations and machines will also benefit from this disclosure. Operation of the example aircraft includes high attitude orientations about the pitch and roll axes. Such high attitudes present challenges to the operation of systems that otherwise operate without issue at normal or less extreme orientations.

Referring to with continued reference to the example APU includes a gearbox that is driven by a power plant . The example power plant comprises a small gas turbine engine in comparison to the main propulsion power plants ENG ENG and ENG. The gearbox includes a plurality of gears that drive various pumps generators and other aircraft systems. The gears operate at high speeds and require sufficient lubrication without becoming submerged within stored lubricant. Moreover bearings supporting those gears also should not be completely submerged during operation. Submersion of rotating gears and bearings increases wear reduces power output and generates heat within the lubricant. Accordingly the disclosed gearbox includes features that prevent submersion of the gears and bearings during operation at extreme aircraft attitudes but also ensures oil is available to be moved by an associated pump.

A gearbox is illustrated in and includes a lube pump that takes oil from an oil reservoir and delivers the oil upwardly across the gears and bearings in a gear train shown schematically.

The oil reservoir is configured to have an optimized shape such that oil will be available for supply to the lube pump under any change of attitude of the aircraft carrying the gearbox . On the other hand it is also desirable that the oil level not reach the gear train as the gears and bearings would churn and aerate the oil causing high oil temperature shutdowns. As such the oil reservoir is optimized such that it ensures oil will always be above a lowermost end of an oil supply tube but below a lowermost end of the gear train .

To that end the oil reservoir includes enlarged portion at a relatively upper part of the housing for oil reservoir . An intermediate channel is formed between the enlarged rear portions to assist in the producibility of the casting. A smaller back portion of the rear face of the oil reservoir does not extend as far from nominal face of the back as does enlarged portion . As shown the enlarged forward portion ramps through a ramp portion to a smaller portion .

As shown in the enlarged portion extends to enlarged sides on the sides . Enlarged sides do not extend to front face but instead end at point . A ramp merges downwardly to a nominal side face . A front face includes a fill opening that allows oil to be delivered into the housing. Gear train is shown including gears and bearings.

As can be appreciated from the oil reservoir will have a smaller cross sectional area at lower positions than it does at positions toward the top of the enlarged portions . The enlarged portions further have top face extending rearwardly to the nominal face .

As shown in a distance extending along a length of the rotational axis of the lube pump and from the smaller portion can be defined as L. In one embodiment L was 5.29 13.44 cm . A distance L can be defined from the front face to the rear end of the forward enlarged portion . In one embodiment L was 6.04 15.34 cm .

Another distance L can be defined from a forward end of the enlarged side portion to the rear end of enlarged portion . In one embodiment L was 4.55 11.55 cm .

A distance L can be defined as the distance along the enlarged portion to the ramped portion . In one embodiment L was 1.53 3.89 cm . A distance L can be defined as the distance to the lowermost end of the oil reservoir from the bottom of the enlarged portion and the beginning of the ramped portion . In one embodiment L was 4.87 12.37 cm .

In embodiment a ratio of L to L was between 0.8 and 0.9. A ratio of L to L was between 0.3 and 0.4. A ratio of L to L was between 0.7 and 0.8.

As shown in a highest desired level of oil that would typically be provided within the oil reservoir is shown at X. A worst case low oil level is also shown at W. The desired worst case line W is above a bottom of an inlet tube . Inlet tube delivers oil to the lube pump shown schematically in this Figure.

As can be seen in three cross sectional areas A A and Acan be defined within the interior of the oil reservoir . Ais selected to be at the lowermost end . In one embodiment Ahas a cross sectional area of 23.2 in 149.6 cm . Ais selected to be at a location 12.7 cm above the bottom surface . In one embodiment Awas 42.4 in 273.5 cm . Ais selected to be adjacent to the oil fill line X. In one embodiment Awas 40 in 258 cm .

In embodiments of this invention it is preferred that a ratio of Ato Abe less than 3 and between 1.5 and 2.5. It is preferred a ratio of Ato Abe between 0.5 and 0.6. Acould be the largest cross sectional area and is at a spot 75 between the Aarea and the full line A.

With the oil reservoir as shown the smaller cross sectional area in the lower portions such as at A ensures that even a minimum amount of oil in the reservoir will maintain oil upwardly toward the worst case line W and certainly above the bottom at normal or extreme attitudes. Even a small quantity of oil will be sufficient to fill the small area A.

On the other hand the larger cross sectional areas Aand A for example and all of the areas in the immediate vicinity will ensure that even greater quantities of oil will not result in the fill line ramping upwardly and into the gear case such that the gears themselves would be not submerged. That is having dramatically larger cross sectional areas ensures that a good deal more oil will be required to raise the level once the oil begins to reach into the larger cross sectional area portions of the oil reservoir.

Although an embodiment of this invention has been disclosed a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention.
