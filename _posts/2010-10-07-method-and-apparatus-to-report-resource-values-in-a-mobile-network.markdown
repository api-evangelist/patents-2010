title: Method and apparatus to report resource values in a mobile network
abstract: In current systems, a typical way to collect application statistics includes sending requests to a resource manager that can access the resource hardware via a device driver. Current systems require multiple synchronous transactions between the processes, which results in the systems consuming large amounts of central processing unit resources that lead to sub-optimal rates of information retrieval. A method and apparatus configured to use asynchronous messaging across all modules and to return hardware statistics directly from the hardware to an application process, thereby bypassing transactions between the application and the resource manager, and bypassing similar transactions between the resource manager and a device driver. Embodiments of the invention are provided for minimizing the power consumed by the memory and minimizing the amount of dedicated memory necessary to perform.
