It is now well established that angiogenesis which involves the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting endothelium is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders. These include solid tumors and metastasis atherosclerosis retrolental fibroplasia hemangiomas chronic inflammation intraocular neovascular syndromes such as proliferative retinopathies e.g. diabetic retinopathy age related macular degeneration AMD neovascular glaucoma immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Folkman et al. 267 10931 10934 1992 Klagsbrun et al. 53 217 239 1991 and Garner A. Vascular diseases In Pathobiology of Ocular Disease. A Dynamic Approach Garner A. Klintworth G K eds. 2nd Edition Marcel Dekker NY 1994 pp 1625 1710.

In the case of tumor growth angiogenesis appears to be crucial for the transition from hyperplasia to neoplasia and for providing nourishment for the growth and metastasis of the tumor. Folkman et al. 339 58 1989 . The neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to normal cells. A tumor usually begins as a single aberrant cell which can proliferate only to a size of a few cubic millimeters due to the distance from available capillary beds and it can stay dormant without further growth and dissemination for a long period of time. Some tumor cells then switch to the angiogenic phenotype to activate endothelial cells which proliferate and mature into new capillary blood vessels. These newly formed blood vessels not only allow for continued growth of the primary tumor but also for the dissemination and recolonization of metastatic tumor cells. Accordingly a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors. Weidner et al. 324 1 6 1991 Horak et al. 340 1120 1124 1992 Macchiarini et al. 340 145 146 1992 . The precise mechanisms that control the angiogenic switch is not well understood but it is believed that neovascularization of tumor mass results from the net balance of a multitude of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors Folkman 1995 Nat Med 1 1 27 31 .

The process of vascular development is tightly regulated. To date a significant number of molecules mostly secreted factors produced by surrounding cells have been shown to regulate EC differentiation proliferation migration and coalescence into cord like structures. For example vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF has been identified as the key factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and in inducing vascular permeability. Ferrara et al. 18 4 25 1997 . The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system. Furthermore VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders. Ferrara et al. . supra. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined Berkman et al. 91 153 159 1993 Brown et al. 26 86 91 1995 Brown et al. 53 4727 4735 1993 Mattern et al. 73 931 934 1996 Dvorak et al. 146 1029 1039 1995 .

Bv8 has been shown to induce proliferation survival and migration of adrenal cortical capillary endothelial cells LeCouter J. et al. 100 2685 2690 2003 . Bv8 and EG VEGF are two highly related secreted proteins also referred to as prokineticin 1 and 2 which structurally belong to a larger class of peptides defined by a five disulphide bridge motif called a colipase fold DeCouter J. et al. 420 860 867 2002 LeCouter J. et al. 100 2685 2690 2003 Li M. et al. 59 692 698 2001 . Bv8 was initially identified as a secreted protein from the skin of the frog Mollay C. et al. 374 189 196 1999 . The cloning and expression of Bv8 are described in WO 03 020892 published on Mar. 13 2003. Bv8 and EG VEGF bind two highly related G protein coupled receptors GPCR EG VEGF PKR 1 R1 and EG VEGF PKR 2 R2 Masuda Y et al. 293 496 402 2002 Lin D. C. et al. 277 19276 19280 2002 . EG VEGF and Bv8 were characterized as mitogens selective for specific endothelial cell types LeCouter J. et al. 412 6850 877 84 2001 and LeCouter J. et al. 100 2685 2690 2003 . Other activities have been ascribed to this family including nociception Mollay C. et al. supra gastrointestinal tract motility Li M. et al. supra regulation of circadian locomotor rhythm Cheng M. Y. et al. 417 405 410 2002 and olfactory bulb neurogenesis Matsumoto S. et al. 103 4140 4145 2006 . Furthermore Bv8 stimulated production of granulocytic and monocytic colonies in vitro LeCouter J. et al. 2003 supra Dorsch M. et al. 78 2 426 34 2005 . Bv8 has been characterized as a chemoattractact for macrophages LeCouter et al. 101 16813 16919 2004 .

Terms Bv8 Bv8 homologue prokineticin 2 also known as PK2 KAL4 and MITI are used herein interchangeably and refer to the full length polypeptide and or the active fragments of the full length polypeptide. Native sequence Bv8 encompasses naturally occurring prepro pro and mature forms and truncated forms of Bv8 naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. In certain embodiments native Bv8 amino acid sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOs 235 to 239. Human and murine Bv8 sequences are also disclosed for example in Wechselberger et al. 462 177 181 1999 and Li et al. 59 692 698 2001 .

 Bv8 receptor is a molecule to which Bv8 binds and which mediates the biological properties of Bv8. Therefore the term Bv8 receptor includes within its meaning PKR1 GPR73 EG VEGF receptor 1 PROKR1 and PKR2 GPR73L1 EG VEGF receptor 2 PROKR2 LeCouter et al. 2003 100 2685 2690 Lin et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 19276 19280 Masuda et al. 2002 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 293 396 402 .

The term biological activity and biologically active with regard to a polypeptide refer to the ability of a molecule to specifically bind to and regulate cellular responses e.g. proliferation migration etc. Cellular responses also include those mediated through a receptor including but not limited to migration and or proliferation.

 Active or activity in connection with Bv8 for the purposes herein refers to form s of Bv8 which retain a biological and or an immunological activity of native or naturally occurring Bv8 wherein biological activity refers to a biological function either inhibitory or stimulatory caused by a native or naturally occurring Bv8 other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring Bv8 and an immunological activity refers to the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring Bv8. In certain embodiments the biological activity of Bv8 is the ability to modulate myeloid cell mobilization promote tumor angiogenesis and or promote tumor metastasis.

The term anti Bv8 antibody or an antibody that binds to Bv8 refers to an antibody that is capable of binding Bv8 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting Bv8. In certain embodiments an antibody that binds to Bv8 has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM 0.1 nM or 0.01 nM. In certain embodiments an anti Bv8 antibody binds to an epitope of Bv8 that is conserved among Bv8 from different species. In certain embodiments anti Bv8 antibody binds to a same epitope on human Bv8 as an antibody selected from the group consisting of chimeric 2G9 h2G9.K4G1.v19 h2G9.K4G1.v52 h2G9.K4G1.v55 h2G9.K4G1.v73 and chimeric 2D3. In certain embodiments anti Bv8 antibody competes for binding to human Bv8 with an antibody selected from the group consisting of chimeric 2G9 h2G9.K4G1.v19 h2G9.K4G1.v52 h2G9.K4G1.v55 h2G9.K4G1.v73 and chimeric 2D3.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In certain embodiments the Kd or Kd value according is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an anti Bv8 antibody and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 L1 well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a TopCount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 g ml 0.2 M before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophotometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors or expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs alpha anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

 Oligonucleotide as used herein generally refers to short generally single stranded generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally but not necessarily less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies for e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions or hypervariable regions CDRs or HVRs used interchangeably herein both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three HVRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the HVRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two chain Fv species this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these can be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six HVRs three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL Li L2 L3 . In native antibodies H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See e.g. Xu et al. 13 37 45 2000 Johnson and Wu in 248 1 25 Lo ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2003 . Indeed naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See e.g. Hamers Casterman et al. 363 446 448 1993 Sheriff et al. 3 733 736 1996 .

A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

HVRs may comprise extended HVRs as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 or 89 96 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin recipient antibody in which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and or capacity. In some instances FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . See also e.g. Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 115 1998 Harris 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 433 1994 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 982 321 and 7 087 409.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled. e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1992 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 and 5 661 016 Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 813 1994 Fishwild et al. 14 845 851 1996 Neuberger 14 826 1996 and Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

The term multispecific antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers an antibody that has polyeptopic specificity. Such multispecific antibodies include but are not limited to an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain V and a light chain variable domain V wherein the VVunit has polyepitopic specificity antibodies having two or more Vand Vdomains with each VVunit binding to a different epitope antibodies having two or more single variable domains with each single variable domain binding to a different epitope full length antibodies antibody fragments such as Fab Fv dsFv scFv diabodies bispecific diabodies and triabodies and antibody fragments that have been linked covalently or non covalently. According to one embodiment the multispecific antibody is an IgG antibody that binds to each epitope with an affinity of 5 M to 0.001 pM 3 M to 0.001 pM 1 M to 0.001 pM 0.5 M to 0.001 pM or 0.1 M to 0.001 pM.

 Polyepitopic specificity refers to the ability to specifically bind to two or more different epitopes on the same or different antigen s . For example bispecific as used herein refers to the ability to bind two different epitopes. Monospecific refers to the ability to bind only one epitope.

The expression single domain antibodies sdAbs or single variable domain SVD antibodies generally refers to antibodies in which a single variable domain Vor V can confer antigen binding. In other words the single variable domain does not need to interact with another variable domain in order to recognize the target antigen. Examples of single domain antibodies include those derived from camelids lamas and camels and cartilaginous fish e.g. nurse sharks and those derived from recombinant methods from humans and mouse antibodies Nature 1989 341 544 546 Dev Comp Immunol 2006 30 43 56 Trend Biochem Sci 2001 26 230 235 Trends Biotechnol 2003 21 484 490 WO 2005 035572 WO 03 035694 Febs Lett 1994 339 285 290 WO00 29004 WO 02 051870 .

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites.

 The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc. according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. supra . The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 640 323 Figures for EU numbering .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

The term substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values for example one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is for example less than about 50 less than about 40 less than about 30 less than about 20 and or less than about 10 as a function of the reference comparator value.

The phrase substantially reduced or substantially different as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference comparator molecule such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is for example greater than about 10 greater than about 20 greater than about 30 greater than about 40 and or greater than about 50 as a function of the value for the reference comparator molecule.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

The term Fc region herein is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during production or purification of the antibody or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed antibody populations with no K447 residues removed and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include Clq binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed for example in definitions herein.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification preferably one or more amino acid substitution s . Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 homology therewith more preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see e.g. Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed for example in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein.

The term Fc receptor or FcR also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie and Ward. 18 12 592 598 1997 Ghetie et al. 15 7 637 640 1997 Hinton et al. 279 8 6213 6216 2004 WO 2004 92219 Hinton et al. .

Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. PCT Publication WO 2000 42072 Presta and U.S. application Ser. No. 12 577 967 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also e.g. Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function s . Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 or U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 Presta may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMC and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system Clq to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences polypeptides with a variant Fc region and increased or decreased Clq binding capability are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 B1 and WO 1999 51642. See also e.g. Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising antibody refers to an antibody that comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the antibody or by recombinant engineering of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody. Accordingly a composition comprising an antibody having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise an antibody with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

The anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention are preferably monoclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are Fab Fab Fab SH and F ab fragments of the anti Bv8 antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric or humanized. These fragments are useful for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes set forth below.

Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.

The anti Bv8 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to Bv8 may be raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of Bv8 and an adjuvant. Bv8 may be prepared using methods well known in the art some of which are further described herein. For example recombinant production of human and mouse Bv8 is described below. In one embodiment animals are immunized with a Bv8 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In a preferred embodiment animals are immunized with a Bv8 IgG1 fusion protein. Animals ordinarily are immunized against immunogenic conjugates or derivatives of Bv8 with monophosphoryl lipid A MPL trehalose dicrynomycolate TDM Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc. Hamilton Mont. and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti Bv8 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.

Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against Bv8. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti Bv8 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3.

The antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones .

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti Bv8 clones is desired the individual is immunized with Bv8 to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti Bv8 clones is obtained by generating an anti Bv8 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that Bv8 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against Bv8. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for anti Bv8 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing Bv8 specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation with Bv8 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled Bv8 followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which Bv8 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the individual to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. . USA 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al. . USA 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . Preferably the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al. 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity Kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutations can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 96 07754 published 14 Mar. 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10M range.

Bv8 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are known in the art for example in Wechselberger et al. 462 177 181 1999 and Li et al. 59 692 698 2001 . Nucleic acids encoding Bv8 can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al. 28 716 734 1989 such as the triester phosphite phosphoramidite and H phosphonate methods. In one embodiment codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the Bv8 encoding DNA. Alternatively DNA encoding the Bv8 can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.

Following construction of the DNA molecule encoding the Bv8 the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector such as a plasmid wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Suitable vectors for expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and some are further described herein. Eukaryotic organisms such as yeasts or cells derived from multicellular organisms such as mammals may be used.

Optionally the DNA encoding the Bv8 is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stIl ecotin lamB herpes GD 1 pp alkaline phosphatase invertase and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A Abrahmsen et al. 4 3901 1985 .

Host cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaPOprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell. Methods for transfection are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. Methods for transformation are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Prokaryotic host cells used to produce the Bv8 can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook et al. supra.

The mammalian host cells used to produce the Bv8 can be cultured in a variety of media which is well known in the art and some of which is described herein.

The host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in in vitro culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.

Purification of Bv8 may be accomplished using art recognized methods some of which are described herein.

The purified Bv8 can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads acrylamide beads glass beads cellulose various acrylic copolymers hydroxylmethacrylate gels polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers nylon neutral and ionic carriers and the like for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the Bv8 protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in vol. 44 1976 . A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices e.g. agarose dextran or cellulose involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand s primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.

Alternatively Bv8 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other art known method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized Bv8 under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or by Bv8 antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1.000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for Bv8. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting Bv8 rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated Bv8 but with the biotinylated Bv8 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for Bv8. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.

Bv8 clones may be activity selected. In one embodiment the invention provides Bv8 antibodies that block the binding between a Bv8 and its ligand e.g. Bv8 receptors PKR1 and PKR2 . Fv clones corresponding to such Bv8 antibodies can be selected by 1 isolating Bv8 clones from a phage library as described above and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host 2 selecting Bv8 and a second protein against which blocking and non blocking activity respectively is desired 3 adsorbing the anti Bv8 phage clones to immobilized Bv8 4 using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize Bv8 binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein and 5 eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step 4 . Optionally clones with the desired blocking non blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.

DNA encoding the hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In a preferred embodiment a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for all human full or partial length heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding anti Bv8 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments see Hudson et al. 2003 Nat. Med. 9 129 134.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.

The invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody. See e.g. Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. See e.g. Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by HVR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or HVR residues of non human origin.

One example of a multispecific antibody of this invention includes an antibody that binds to Bv8 and to another antigen. In other embodiments multispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of Bv8. Multispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express Bv8. These antibodies possess a Bv8 binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent such as e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Multispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Various methods for making bispecific antibodies have been described in the art. One of the first approaches involved co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion for example is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments the first heavy chain constant region CH1 is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In one embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach knob into hole or KnH technology refers to a technology that directs the pairing of two polypeptides together in vitro or in vivo by introducing a pertuberance knob into one polypeptide and a cavity hole into the other polypeptide at an interface in which they interact. For example KnHs have been introduced in the Fc Fc binding interfaces CL CHinterfaces or VH VL interfaces of antibodies e.g. US20007 0178552 WO 96 027011 WO 98 050431 and Zhu et al. 1997 Protein Science 6 781 788 . This is especially useful in driving the pairing of two different heavy chains together during the manufacture of multispecific antibodies. For example multispecific antibodies having KnH in their Fc regions can further comprise single variable domains linked to each Fc region or further comprise different heavy chain variable domains that pair with similar or different light chain variable domains. According to one embodiment one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Multipecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking method. Suitable cross linking agents and techniques are known e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 .

Techniques for generating multispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Fab SH fragments can be recovered from and can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments the dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain for example two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region Xand Xrepresent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two for example four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In certain embodiments an anti Bv8 antibody of the invention is a single domain antibody. A single domain antibody is a single polyeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments a single domain antibody is a human single domain antibody Domantis Inc. Waltham Mass. see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 248 516 B1 . In one embodiment a single domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the anti Bv8 antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition deletion or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 1997 15 26 32. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine G1cNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

For example antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. Such variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells see e.g. Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 Kanda Y. et al. 94 4 680 688 2006 and WO2003 085107 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Such substitutions may occur in combination with any of the variations described above.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 92 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay may be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M.S and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see for example Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Other antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. More substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions are provided in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened e.g. for a desired activity such as improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity improved ADCC or CDC etc.

Modifications in the biological properties of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions that affect a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have modified e.g. improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated using phage display based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein e.g. the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity . In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification scanning mutagenesis e.g. alanine scanning can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art including those described herein and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished Clq binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased Clq binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

In another aspect the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region wherein the modifications facilitate and or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168.

In yet another aspect it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and S400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region.

The anti Bv8 antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.

In one aspect assays are provided for identifying anti Bv8 antibodies thereof having biological activity. Biological activity may include e.g. the modulation of one or more aspects of Bv8 associated effects including but not limited to Bv8 binding Bv8 mediated endothelial cell proliferation tumor metastasis.

In certain embodiments of the invention the immunoglobulins produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the immunoglobulins of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays. An illustrative antigen binding assay is provided below in the Examples section.

The purified antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In some embodiments the present invention contemplates altered antibodies that possess some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 . Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.

In some embodiments the invention provides altered antibodies that possess increased effector functions and or increased half life. See e.g. U.S. application Ser. No. 12 577 967.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM. 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene 159 203 1995 .

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann Cellular and Molecular Biology vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kanR U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 . Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. J. Immunol. Methods 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an OD550 of about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. Microbial Drug Resistance 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies where relevant or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 .

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT SEQ ID NO 206 region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA SEQ ID NO 207 sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv Nature 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody polypeptide encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. J. Gen Virol. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather Biol. Reprod. 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TR1 cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. Meth. Enz. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. Anal. Biochem. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. No. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCINT drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. EMBO J. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising an antibody conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. a protein toxin an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Immunoconjugates have been used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents i.e. drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of cells in the treatment of cancer Lambert J. 2005 5 543 549 Wu et al 2005 23 9 1137 1146 Payne G. 2003 i 3 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of unconjugated drugs may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. Mar. 15 1986 pp. 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in 84 A. Pinchera et al. eds pp. 475 506. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 105 HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF disclosed in Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. Lake The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 588 Pettit et al 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863. See also Doronina 2003 Nat Biotechno121 7 778 784 Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 disclosing e.g. linkers and methods of preparing monomethylvaline compounds such as MMAE and MMAF conjugated to linkers .

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to 1I 2I 3I N acetyl 1I PSAG and I1 Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tc99m or I123 or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcm or I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D I

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

This invention also encompasses compositions including pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti Bv8 antibody and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding an anti Bv8 antibody. As used herein compositions comprise one or more antibodies that bind to Bv8 and or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies that bind to Bv8. These compositions may further comprise suitable carriers such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers which are well known in the art.

Therapeutic formulations comprising anti Bv8 antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 20th edition 2000 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 20th edition 2000 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

The type of such second medicament depends on various factors including the type of disorder the severity of the disease the condition and age of the patient the type and dose of first medicament employed etc.

Where an antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth for example it may be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agents that also inhibit tumor growth.

In addition combining an antibody of this invention with a relatively non cytotoxic agent such as another biologic molecule e.g. another antibody is expected to reduce cytotoxicity versus combining the antibody with a chemotherapeutic agent of other agent that is highly toxic to cells.

Treatment with a combination of the antibody herein with one or more second medicaments preferably results in an improvement in the signs or symptoms of cancer. For instance such therapy may result in an improvement in survival overall survival and or progression free survival relative to a patient treated with the second medicament only e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent only and or may result in an objective response partial or complete . Moreover treatment with the combination of an antibody herein and one or more second medicament s preferably results in an additive and more preferably synergistic or greater than additive therapeutic benefit to the patient. In certain embodiments the timing between at least one administration of the second medicament and at least one administration of the antibody herein is about one month or less. In certain embodiments the timing between at least one administration of the second medicament and at least one administration of the antibody herein is about two weeks or less.

Many anti angiogenic agents have been identified and are known in the art including those listed herein e.g. listed under Definitions and by e.g. Carmeliet and Jain Nature 407 249 257 2000 Ferrara et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 3 391 400 2004 and Sato Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 8 200 206 2003 . See also US Patent Application US20030055006. In one embodiment an anti Bv8 antibody is used in combination with an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment and or another VEGF antagonist or a VEGF receptor antagonist including but not limited to for example soluble VEGF receptor e.g. VEGFR 1 VEGFR 2 VEGFR 3 neuropilins e.g. NRP1 NRP2 fragments aptamers capable of blocking VEGF or VEGFR neutralizing anti VEGFR antibodies low molecule weight inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinases RTK antisense strategies for VEGF ribozymes against VEGF or VEGF receptors antagonist variants of VEGF and any combinations thereof. Alternatively or additionally two or more angiogenesis inhibitors may optionally be co administered to the patient in addition to VEGF antagonist and other agent.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful herein are described supra e.g. in the definition of chemotherapeutic agent .

Such second medicaments may be administered within 48 hours after the antibodies herein are administered or within 24 hours or within 12 hours or within 3 12 hours after said agent or may be administered over a pre selected period of time which is preferably about 1 to 2 days. Further the dose of such agent may be sub therapeutic.

The antibodies herein can be administered concurrently sequentially or alternating with the second medicament or upon non responsiveness with other therapy. Thus the combined administration of a second medicament includes co administration concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all medicaments simultaneously exert their biological activities. All these second medicaments may be used in combination with each other or by themselves with the first medicament so that the express second medicament as used herein does not mean it is the only medicament besides the first medicament respectively. Thus the second medicament need not be one medicament but may constitute or comprise more than one such drug.

These second medicaments as set forth herein are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as the first medicaments or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages of the first medicaments. If such second medicaments are used at all preferably they are used in lower amounts than if the first medicament were not present especially in subsequent dosings beyond the initial dosing with the first medicament so as to eliminate or reduce side effects caused thereby.

The invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing refractory tumor relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth. In certain embodiments relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies e.g. cancer therapies such as chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery hormonal therapy and or biological therapy immunotherapy anti VEGF antibody therapy particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer is not clinically adequate to treat the patients or the patients are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these patients need additional effective therapy. In certain embodiments a cancer is relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased or tumor size has not been significantly reduced or has increased or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. In certain embodiments patients with relapsed tumor trowth or relapsed cancer cell growth have developed resistance to one or more currently available therapies. In certain embodiments the term refractory is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies e.g. cancer therapies such as chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery hormonal therapy and or biological therapy immunotherapy anti VEGF antibody therapy particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer is not clinically adequate to treat the patients. In certain embodiments the non responsive refractory patients are patients who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects do not respond to the therapy or do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy etc. In certain embodiments a cancer is a non responsive refractory tumor where the tumor is intrinsically non responsive or resistant to previous treatments. In certain embodiments refractory refers to an intrinsically non responsiveness of a disease or condition to a therapy comprising a VEGF antagonist. The determination of whether the cancer cells are refractory relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells using the art accepted meanings of relapse or refractory or non responsive in such context.

The invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth in a subject by administering an effective amount of anti Bv8 antibody to block or reduce the relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth in subject. The invention provides methods of treating patients refractory to a therapy comprising a VEGF antagonist by administering an effective amount of anti Bv8 antibody to the patient. In certain embodiments the anti Bv8 antibody can be administered subsequent to the other cancer therapeutic. In certain embodiments the anti Bv8 antibody is administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively or additionally the anti Bv8 antibody therapy alternates with another cancer therapy which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in patients predisposed to having cancer. Generally the subject was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti angiogenic agent e.g. a VEGF antagonist. The anti angiogenic agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment the anti angiogenic agent is an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment e.g. humanized A4.6.1 AVASTIN Genentech South San Francisco Calif. Y0317 M4 G6 B20 2C3 etc. . See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 582 959 6 884 879 6 703 020 WO98 45332 WO 96 30046 WO94 10202 EP 0666868B1 US Patent Applications 20030206899 20030190317 20030203409 and 20050112126 Popkov et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 288 149 164 2004 and WO2005012359. Additional agents can be administered in combination with VEGF antagonist and an anti Bv8 antibody for treating refractory tumor blocking or reducing relapsed tumor growth or relapsed cancer cell growth.

The anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention and adjunct therapeutic agent is are administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the anti Bv8 antibodies are suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target is an intracellular molecule certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to be introduced into the cell where the binding target is located. In one embodiment an anti Bv8 antibody of the invention can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody. The term intrabody as used herein refers to an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof that is expressed intracellularly and that is capable of selectively binding to a target molecule as described e.g. in Marasco 4 11 15 1997 Kontermann 34 163 170 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 004 940 and 6 329 173 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0104402 and PCT Publication No. WO2003 077945. See also for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

Intracellular expression of an intrabody may be effected by introducing a nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody or antigen binding portion thereof lacking the wild type leader sequence and secretory signals normally associated with the gene encoding that antibody or antigen binding fragment into a target cell. One or more nucleic acids encoding all or a portion of an antibody of the invention can be delivered to a target cell such that one or more intrabodies are expressed which are capable of binding to an intracellular target polypeptide and modulating the activity of the target polypeptide. Any standard method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell may be used including but not limited to microinjection ballistic injection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation liposomes and transfection with retroviral adenoviral adeno associated viral and vaccinia vectors carrying the nucleic acid of interest.

In certain embodiments nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector may be introduced into a patient s cells by in vivo and ex vivo methods. In one example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient e.g. at the site where therapeutic intervention is required. In a further example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is introduced into a cell using transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of certain gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 and WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein. In an example of ex vivo treatment a patient s cells are removed nucleic acid is introduced into those isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of a nucleic acid is a retroviral vector.

In another embodiment internalizing antibodies are provided. Antibodies can possess certain characteristics that enhance delivery of antibodies into cells or can be modified to possess such characteristics. Techniques for achieving this are known in the art. For example cationization of an antibody is known to facilitate its uptake into cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 019 . Lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the target protein may be advantageous. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 .

Entry of antibodies into target cells can be enhanced by other methods known in the art. For example certain sequences such as those derived from HIV Tat or the Antennapedia homeodomain protein are able to direct efficient uptake of heterologous proteins across cell membranes. See e.g. Chen et al. 1999 96 4325 4329.

When the binding target of an antibody is located in the brain certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody to traverse the blood brain barrier. Several art known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood brain barrier including but not limited to physical methods lipid based methods stem cell based methods and receptor and channel based methods.

Physical methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to circumventing the blood brain barrier entirely or by creating openings in the blood brain barrier. Circumvention methods include but are not limited to direct injection into the brain see e.g. Papanastassiou et al. 9 398 406 2002 interstitial infusion convection enhanced delivery see e.g. Bobo et al. 91 2076 2080 1994 and implanting a delivery device in the brain see e.g. Gill et al. 9 589 595 2003 and Gliadel Wafers Guildford Pharmaceutical . Methods of creating openings in the barrier include but are not limited to ultrasound see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002 0038086 osmotic pressure e.g. by administration of hypertonic mannitol Neuwelt E. A. Vols 1 2 Plenum Press N.Y. 1989 permeabilization by e.g. bradykinin or permeabilizer A 7 see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 112 596 5 268 164 5 506 206 and 5 686 416 and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003 0083299 .

Lipid based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to encapsulating the antibody in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313 and coating the antibody in low density lipoprotein particles see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354 or apolipoprotein E see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692 .

Stem cell based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier entail genetically engineering neural progenitor cells NPCs to express the antibody of interest and then implanting the stem cells into the brain of the individual to be treated. See Behrstock et al. 2005 15 Dec. 2005 advanced online publication reporting that NPCs genetically engineered to express the neurotrophic factor GDNF reduced symptoms of Parkinson disease when implanted into the brains of rodent and primate models .

Receptor and channel based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0065259 2003 0162695 and 2005 0124533 activating potassium channels see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0089473 inhibiting ABC drug transporters see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0073713 coating antibodies with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0129186 and cationizing the antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 004 697 .

Anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention would be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The anti Bv8 antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages described herein or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically clinically determined to be appropriate.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 50 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg 10 mg kg 15 mg kg 20 mg.kg or 25 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The anti Bv8 antibodies of the invention are useful in assays detecting Bv8 expression such as diagnostic or prognostic assays in specific cells or tissues wherein the antibodies are labeled as described below and or are immobilized on an insoluble matrix.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for detection of Bv8 the methods comprising detecting Bv8 anti Bv8 antibody complex in the sample. The term detection as used herein includes qualitative and or quantitative detection measuring levels with or without reference to a control.

In another aspect the invention provides any of the anti Bv8 antibodies described herein wherein the anti Bv8 antibody comprises a detectable label.

In another aspect the invention provides a complex of any of the anti Bv8 antibodies described herein and Bv8. In some embodiments the complex is in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments the complex comprises a cancer cell. In some embodiments the anti Bv8 antibody is detectably labeled.

Anti Bv8 antibodies e.g. any of the Bv8 antibodies described herein can be used for the detection of Bv8 in any one of a number of well known detection assay methods.

For example a biological sample may be assayed for Bv8 by obtaining the sample from a desired source admixing the sample with anti Bv8 antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody Bv8 complex with any Bv8 present in the mixture and detecting any antibody Bv8 complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody Bv8 complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include immunohistochemistry competitive and sandwich assays and steric inhibition assays. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. Examples of samples include but are not limited to cancer cells such as colon breast prostate ovary lung stomach pancreas lymphoma and leukemia cancer cells. Bv8 may also be measured in serum. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology 3edition 1960 Lee G. Luna H T ASCP Editor The Blakston Division McGraw Hill Book Company New York 1994 Ulreka V. Mikel Editor Armed Forces Institute of Pathology American Registry of Pathology Washington D.C. . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used. By way of example neutral buffered formalin Bouin s or paraformaldehyde may be used to fix a sample. Generally the sample is first fixed and is then dehydrated through an ascending series of alcohols infiltrated and embedded with paraffin or other sectioning media so that the tissue sample may be sectioned. Alternatively one may section the tissue and fix the sections obtained. By way of example the tissue sample may be embedded and processed in paraffin by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Examples of paraffin that may be used include but are not limited to Paraplast Broloid and Tissuemay. Once the tissue sample is embedded the sample may be sectioned by a microtome or the like See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . By way of example for this procedure sections may range from about three microns to about five microns in thickness. Once sectioned the sections may be attached to slides by several standard methods. Examples of slide adhesives include but are not limited to silane gelatin poly L lysine and the like. By way of example the paraffin embedded sections may be attached to positively charged slides and or slides coated with poly L lysine. If paraffin has been used as the embedding material the tissue sections are generally deparaffinized and rehydrated to water. The tissue sections may be deparaffinized by several conventional standard methodologies. For example xylenes and a gradually descending series of alcohols may be used See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Alternatively commercially available deparaffinizing non organic agents such as Hemo De7 CMS Houston Tex. may be used.

Analytical methods for Bv8 all use one or more of the following reagents labeled Bv8 analogue immobilized Bv8 analogue labeled anti Bv8 antibody immobilized anti Bv8 antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as tracers. 

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of Bv8 and anti Bv8 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected.

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of Bv8 and anti Bv8 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides bis imidates bis diazotized benzidine and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above described fluorescent chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 940 475 fluorimetry and U.S. Pat. No. 3 645 090 enzymes Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1021 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 230 1981 and Nygren 30 407 412 1982 . Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label including the enzymes to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See for example O Sullivan et al. Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay in ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis Vol. 73 Academic Press New York N.Y. 1981 pp. 147 166.

Immobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods Immobilization entails separating the anti Bv8 antibody from any Bv8 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti Bv8 antibody or Bv8 analogue before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti Bv8 antibody or Bv8 analogue afterward e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

The expression of proteins in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry IHC techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens in situ generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used.

IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay binding of antibody to the target antigen e.g. Bv8 is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme labeled primary antibody which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.

The primary and or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available.

Aside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above further treatment of the tissue section prior to during or following IHC may be desired For example epitope retrieval methods such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out see e.g. Leong et al. 4 3 201 1996 .

Following an optional blocking step the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably the label is an enzymatic label e.g. HRPO which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3 3 diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody e.g. the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti rabbit antibody .

Specimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined e.g. using a microscope and staining intensity criteria routinely used in the art may be employed.

Other assay methods known as competitive or sandwich assays are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.

Competitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer Bv8 analogue to compete with the test sample Bv8 for a limited number of anti Bv8 antibody antigen binding sites. The anti Bv8 antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and Bv8 bound to the anti Bv8 antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and Bv8. This separation is accomplished by decanting where the binding partner was preinsolubilized or by centrifuging where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction . The amount of test sample Bv8 is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose response curves with known amounts of Bv8 are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of Bv8 present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.

Another species of competitive assay called a homogeneous assay does not require a phase separation. Here a conjugate of an enzyme with the Bv8 is prepared and used such that when anti Bv8 antibody binds to the Bv8 the presence of the anti Bv8 antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case the Bv8 or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti Bv8 antibody so that binding of the anti Bv8 antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method per se is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.

Steric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low molecular weight hapten to a small Bv8 fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti Bv8 antibody. Under this assay procedure the Bv8 present in the test sample will bind anti Bv8 antibody thereby allowing anti hapten to bind the conjugate resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten e.g. a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.

Sandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of Bv8 or anti Bv8 antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti Bv8 antibody is used to adsorb test sample Bv8 the test sample is removed as by washing the bound Bv8 is used to adsorb a second labeled anti Bv8 antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample Bv8. In simultaneous sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti Bv8. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti Bv8 monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti Bv8 antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for Bv8.

The foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for Bv8. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti Bv8 antibody for the determination of Bv8 are included within the scope hereof including the bioassays described herein.

In one aspect the invention provides methods to detect e.g. presence or absence of or amount a polynucleotide s e.g. Bv8 polynucleotides in a biological sample from an individual such as a human subject. A variety of methods for detecting polynucleotides can be employed and include for example RT PCR taqman amplification methods polynucleotide microarray and the like.

Methods for the detection of polynucleotides such as mRNA are well known and include for example hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes such as in situ hybridization using labeled Bv8 riboprobes Northern blot and related techniques and various nucleic acid amplification assays such as RT PCR using complementary primers specific for Bv8 and other amplification type detection methods such as for example branched DNA SPIA Ribo SPIA SISBA TMA and the like .

Biological samples from mammals can be conveniently assayed for e.g. Bv8 mRNAs using Northern dot blot or PCR analysis. For example RT PCR assays such as quantitative PCR assays are well known in the art. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention a method for detecting Bv8 mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer amplifying the cDNA so produced using an Bv8 polynucleotide as sense and antisense primers to amplify Bv8 cDNAs therein and detecting the presence or absence of the amplified Bv8 cDNA. In addition such methods can include one or more steps that allow one to determine the amount levels of Bv8 mRNA in a biological sample e.g. by simultaneously examining the levels a comparative control mRNA sequence of a housekeeping gene such as an actin family member . Optionally the sequence of the amplified Bv8 cDNA can be determined

Probes and or primers may be labeled with a detectable marker such as for example a radioisotope fluorescent compound bioluminescent compound a chemiluminescent compound metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers can be used to detect the presence of Bv8 polynucleotides in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing Bv8 proteins. As will be understood by the skilled artisan a great many different primers and probes may be prepared e.g. based on the sequences provided in herein and used effectively to amplify clone and or determine the presence or absence of and or amount of Bv8 mRNAs.

Optional methods of the invention include protocols comprising detection of polynucleotides such as Bv8 polynucleotide in a tissue or cell sample using microarray technologies. For example using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes that have potential to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. Differential gene expression analysis of disease tissue can provide valuable information. Microarray technology utilizes nucleic acid hybridization techniques and computing technology to evaluate the mRNA expression profile of thousands of genes within a single experiment. see e.g. WO 01 75166 published Oct. 11 2001 See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 637 U.S. Pat. No. 5 445 934 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 522 Lockart Nature Biotechnology 14 1675 1680 1996 Cheung V. G. et al. 21 Suppl 15 19 1999 for a discussion of array fabrication . DNA microarrays are miniature arrays containing gene fragments that are either synthesized directly onto or spotted onto glass or other substrates. Thousands of genes are usually represented in a single array. A typical microarray experiment involves the following steps 1. preparation of fluorescently labeled target from RNA isolated from the sample 2. hybridization of the labeled target to the microarray 3. washing staining and scanning of the array 4. analysis of the scanned image and 5. generation of gene expression profiles. Currently two main types of DNA microarrays are being used oligonucleotide usually 25 to 70 mers arrays and gene expression arrays containing PCR products prepared from cDNAs. In forming an array oligonucleotides can be either prefabricated and spotted to the surface or directly synthesized on to the surface in situ .

The Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercially available microarray system which comprises arrays fabricated by direct synthesis of oligonucleotides on a glass surface. Probe Gene Arrays Oligonucleotides usually 25 mers are directly synthesized onto a glass wafer by a combination of semiconductor based photolithography and solid phase chemical synthesis technologies. Each array contains up to 400 000 different oligos and each oligo is present in millions of copies. Since oligonucleotide probes are synthesized in known locations on the array the hybridization patterns and signal intensities can be interpreted in terms of gene identity and relative expression levels by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. Each gene is represented on the array by a series of different oligonucleotide probes. Each probe pair consists of a perfect match oligonucleotide and a mismatch oligonucleotide. The perfect match probe has a sequence exactly complimentary to the particular gene and thus measures the expression of the gene. The mismatch probe differs from the perfect match probe by a single base substitution at the center base position disturbing the binding of the target gene transcript. This helps to determine the background and nonspecific hybridization that contributes to the signal measured for the perfect match oligo. The Microarray Suite software subtracts the hybridization intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect match probes to determine the absolute or specific intensity value for each probe set. Probes are chosen based on current information from GenBank and other nucleotide repositories. The sequences are believed to recognize unique regions of the 3 end of the gene. A GeneChip Hybridization Oven rotisserie oven is used to carry out the hybridization of up to 64 arrays at one time. The fluidics station performs washing and staining of the probe arrays. It is completely automated and contains four modules with each module holding one probe array. Each module is controlled independently through Microarray Suite software using preprogrammed fluidics protocols. The scanner is a confocal laser fluorescence scanner which measures fluorescence intensity emitted by the labeled cRNA bound to the probe arrays. The computer workstation with Microarray Suite software controls the fluidics station and the scanner. Microarray Suite software can control up to eight fluidics stations using preprogrammed hybridization wash and stain protocols for the probe array. The software also acquires and converts hybridization intensity data into a presence absence call for each gene using appropriate algorithms. Finally the software detects changes in gene expression between experiments by comparison analysis and formats the output into .txt files which can be used with other software programs for further data analysis.

The following are examples of the methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced given the general description provided above.

Commercially available reagents referred to in the Examples were used according to manufacturer s instructions unless otherwise indicated.

This example demonstrates the humanization of the murine anti Bv8 antibodies directed against Bv8. Residue numbers are according to Kabat Kabat et al. Sequences of proteins of immunological interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Single letter amino acid abbreviations are used.

Anti Bv8 antibodies were generated by immunizing mouse or hamster with recombinant human Bv8 extracellular domain polypeptides PeproTech Rock Hill N.J. . Clones 2G9 2B9 3F1 derived from mouse hybridoma comprising the variable light VL and variable heavy VH sequences set forth in B A B A and B were selected. Clone 2D3 derived from hamster hybridoma comprising the VH and VL sequences set forth in was also selected.

Cloning of Hybridoma Derived Anti Bv8 Antibodies Variable Domains and Generation of Chimeric Antibodies

Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells producing the mouse anti Bv8 monoclonal antibody 2B9 3F1 and 2G9 as well as hamster anti Bv8 monoclonal antibody 2D3 respectively using RNeasy Mini Kit Catalog 74104 QIAGEN Valencia Calif. . The variable light VL and variable heavy VH domains were amplified using RT PCR with the following degenerate primers 

The forward primers were specific for the N terminal amino acid sequence of the VL and VH region. Respectively the light chain LC and heavy chain HC reverse primers were designed to anneal to a region in the constant light CL and constant heavy domain 1 CH1 which is highly conserved across species.

Amplified PCR products were subsequently ligated to a TA cloning vector Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and sequenced. The identified VL DNA sequence was then subcloned into pRK mammalian cell expression vector Carter et al. 89 4285 4289 1992 containing the human kappa constant domain. The VH DNA sequence was inserted into pRK vectors encoding the full length human 1 constant domains.

The LC and HC expression vectors were co transfected into the adenovirus transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 using Fugene transfection reagents Roche Mannheim Germany Antibody was produced in serum free media and purified by Protein A chromatography.

The phagemid used for this work is a monovalent Fab g3 display vector and consists of 2 open reading frames under control of a single phoA promoter. The first open reading frame consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VL and CL domains of the acceptor light chain and the second consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VH and CH1 domains of the acceptor heavy chain followed by the minor phage coat protein P3.

Prior to generating CDR graft variants of anti Bv8 antibodies the variable light VL and variable heavy VH domains of mouse antibodies were sequence aligned with human consensus sequences.

For clones 2B9 and 3F1 human consensus light chain kappa 1 huKI and human consensus heavy chain subgroup III huGIII were the closest human frameworks and the hypervariable regions of mouse 2B9 m2B9 and mouse 3F1 m3F1 light chain and heavy chain sequences were grafted into huKI and huGIII consensus acceptor frameworks respectively to generate direct CDR graft variants called h2B9.v1 and h3F1.v1 .

Interestingly for clone 2G9 the closest human frameworks to mouse 2G9 were human consensus light chain kappa IV huKIV and human consensus heavy chain subgroup I huGI . Therefore initially the hypervariable regions of mouse 2G9 m2G9 light chain and heavy chain were grafted not only into huKI and huGIII but also huKIV and huGI consensus acceptor frameworks respectively to generate four different CDR graft variants identified as h2G9.K1G1 h2G9.K1G3 h2G9.K4G1 and h2G9.K4G3 . Human VL kappa subgroup IV consensus framework sequence minus Kabat light chain HVR sequences is shown in SEQ ID NO 240. Human VH subgroup I consensus framework sequence minus heavy chain HVR sequences is shown in SEQ ID NO 241. See . In the VL domain the following regions were grafted to the human consensus acceptor positions 24 34 in L 50 56 in L2 and 89 97 in L3. In the VH domain positions 26 35 in H1 49 65 71 and 73 in H2 and 95 102 in H3 were grafted.

Direct CDR graft variants h2B9.v1 h3F1.v1 h2G9.K1G1 h2G9.K1G3 h2G9.K4G1 h2G9.K4G3 were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis as both a Fab displayed on phage and an IgG using separate oligonucleotides for each hypervariable region. Correct clones were identified by DNA sequencing.

Binding affinities of the four CDR graft anti Bv8 antibody variants h2G9.K1G1 h2G9.K1G3 h2G9.K4G1 and h2G9.K4G3 were measured by Biacore using a BIAcore 3000 instrument as described herein. In addition adrenal cortical endothelial cells ACE proliferation assay was performed as described herein to investigate the Bv8 neutralizing activity of the four variants.

The results of the BIAcore analysis showed that variants h2G9.K1G1 and h2G9.K1G3 had significantly fast off rate at high concentration analysis compared to h2G9.K4G1 and h2G9.K4G3. Furthermore the ACE proliferation assay showed that among the four variants variant h2G9.K4G1 had the best activity as it almost completely blocked the binding of Bv8 to ACE cells. However the BIAcore analysis and ACE proliferation assay indicated that the binding affinity and neutralizing activity of h2G9.K4G1 anti Bv8 antibody were still lower than those of the chimeric 2G9 anti Bv8 antibody. Therefore anti Bv8 antibody h2G9.K4G1 was selected for affinity maturation to further improve its binding affinity.

Prior to initiating affinity maturation of anti Bv8 antibody h2G9.K4G1 the HVR sequences were analysed for potential stability problems involving isomerization unpaired cysteine and deamidation during the manufacturing process. Potential problems were identified at the following sites i the adjacent residues at positions 28 and 29 of the light chain variable sequence ii position 52a of the heavy chain variable sequence iii position 54 of the heavy chain variable sequence and iv the adjacent residues at positions 95 and 96 of the heavy chain variable sequence.

Variants of anti Bv8 antibody h2G9.K4G1 with single amino acid substitution at residue positions mentioned above were generated and each variant was displayed as a Fab on the phage. Total of 12 variants with the following single amino acid modification were generated and their binding affinities were evaluated by the phage competition ELISA CDR L1 D28E D28S G29A G29S CDR H2 C52aA C52aS N54A N54S CDR H3 D95E D95S G96A G96S. The binding affinities of the 12 variants compared to h2G9.K4G1 are shown in . The Figures show that most of the variants retained similar or slightly improved binding affinity. Surprisingly the variant with D95S substitution in CDR H3 completely lost the binding at 1 M of human Bv8. Furthermore the variant with D95E substitution in CDR H3 showed a significant binding affinity drop by 100 fold compared to h2G9.K4G1.

A clone identified as h2G9.K4G1.Polish was generated by combining all of the following four amino acid substitutions CDR L1 D28S CDR H2 C52aS N54S CDR H3 G96S. BIAcore analysis showed a similar binding affinities for chimeric 2G9 Fab and h2G9.K4G1.Polish Fab and both chimeric 2G9 IgG and h2G9.K4G1.Polish IgG showed complete blocking of Bv8 induced ACE cell proliferation . Furthermore the amino acid substitutions at CDR L1 D28S CDR H2 C52aS N54S CDR H3 G96S anti Bv8 antibody h2G9.K4G1.Polish unexpectedly restored the binding affinity close to that of the chimeric 2G9 anti Bv8 antibody.

The sequence diversity was introduced into each hypervariable region to further improve affinity for clone h2G9.K4G1.Polish using a soft randomization strategy that maintains a bias towards the murine hypervariable region sequence. This was accomplished using a poisoned oligonucleotide synthesis strategy first described by Gallop et al. 37 1233 1251 1994 . For a given position within a hypervariable region to be mutated the codon encoding the wild type amino acid is poisoned with a 70 10 10 10 mixture of nucleotides resulting in an average 50 percent mutation rate at each position. Soft randomized oligonucleotides were patterned after the murine hypervariable region sequences and encompassed the same regions defined by the direct hypervariable region grafts.

Randomized oligonucleotide pools designed for each hypervariable region were phosphorylated separately in six 20 l reactions containing 660 ng of oligonucleotide 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl 1 mM ATP 20 mM DTT and 5 U polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 C. The six phosphorylated oligonucleotide pools were then combined with 20 g of Kunkel template in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgClin a final volume of 500 l resulting in an oligonucleotide to template ratio of 3. The mixture was annealed at 90 C. for 4 min 50 C. for 5 min and then cooled on ice. Excess unannealed oligonucleotide was removed with a QIAquick PCR purification kit Catalog 28106 QIAGEN Inc. Valencia Calif. using a modified protocol to prevent excessive denaturation of the annealed DNA. To the 500 l of annealed mixture 150 l of PB was added and the mixture was split between 2 silica columns. Following a wash of each column with 750 l of PE and an extra spin to dry the columns each column was eluted with 110 l of 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA pH 8. The annealed and cleaned up template 220 l was then filled in by adding 1 l 100 mM ATP 10 l 25 mM dNTPs 25 mM each of dATP dCTP dGTP and dTTP 15 l 100 mM DTT 25 l 10 TM buffer 0.5 M Tris pH 7.5 0.1 M MgCl 2400 U T4 ligase and 30 U T7 polymerase for 3 h at room temperature.

The filled in product was analyzed on Tris Acetate EDTA agarose gels Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Three bands are usually visible the bottom band is correctly filled and ligated product the middle band is filled but unligated and the top band is strand displaced. The top band is produced by an intrinsic side activity of T7 polymerase and is difficult to avoid Lechner et al. 258 11174 11184 1983 however this band transforms 30 fold less efficiently than the top band and usually contributes little to the library. The middle band is due to the absence of a 5 phosphate for the final ligation reaction this band transforms efficiently and unfortunately gives mainly wild type sequence.

The filled in product was then cleaned up and electroporated into SS320 cells and propagated in the presence of M13 KO7 helper phage as described by Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Library sizes ranged from 1 2 10independent clones. Random clones from the initial libraries were sequenced to assess library quality.

The human Bv8 PeproTech was used as the target for phage selection. Human Bv8 was coated on Maxisorp microtiter plates Nunc at 10 g ml in PBS for the 1round panning. For the first round of selection 8 wells of target were used a single well of target was used for successive rounds of selection. Wells were blocked for 1 h using Super Blocker Pierce . Phage were harvested from the culture supernatant and suspended in PBS containing 1 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 PBST . After binding to the wells for 2 h unbound phage were removed by extensive washing with PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 PBT . Bound phage were eluted by incubating the wells with 50 mM HCl 0.5 M KCl for 30 min. Phage were propagated and amplified using XL1 blue cells Strategene and M13 KO7 helper phage New England BioLabs and grown overnight at 37 C. in 2YT 50 g ml carbenacillin for the next round of panning. The titers of phage eluted from a target coated well were compared to titers of phage recovered from a non target coated well to assess the enrichment.

Beginning at the 2round sorting the phage libraries were sorted using a solution sorting method Lee C. V. et al. 2004 340 5 1073 93 which allow us to increase the stringency of selection to isolate affinity improved clones. Human Bv8 was biotinylated using Sulfo NHS LC biotin b Bv8 Pierce Rockford Ill. . Microtiter wells were coated with 10 g ml neutravidin in PBS overnight at 4 C and then blocked for 1 h using Super Blocker Pierce . For the second round of selection 200 l phage suspended in PBST buffer were mixed with 5 nM b Bv8 for 2 hr at room temperature RT . Phage bound to b Bv8 were captured on neutravidin coated wells for 15 min at RT and unbound phage were washed away with PBT buffer. Phage were eluted using 100 mM HCl for 30 m neutralized and propagated as described above. The next rounds of selection were performed similarly as round 2 selection with the following exceptions in round 3 and 4 the final b Bv8 concentration was 0.1 nM in rounds 5 the final b Bv8 concentration was 0.05 nM. Beginning round 4 and 5 after phage binding with b Bv8 500 and 1000 fold excess of unbiotinylated human Bv8 respectively were added to the mixture for 1 2 hr at RT to compete off fast off rate binders prior to capture on neutravidin.

MAXISORP microtiter plates were coated with recombinant human Bv8 PeproTech at 2 g ml in PBS overnight and then blocked with PBST buffer 0.5 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS for an hour at room temperature RT . Phage from culture supernatants were incubated with serially diluted human Bv8 in PBST buffer in a tissue culture microtiter plate for an hour at RT after which 80 l of the mixture was transferred to the target coated wells for 15 minutes to capture unbound phage. The plate was washed with PBT buffer 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS and HRP conjugated anti M13 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was added 1 5000 in PBST buffer for 40 minutes. The plate was washed with PBT buffer and developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine substrate Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. . The absorbance at 450 nm was plotted as a function of target concentration in solution to determine phage IC. This was used as an affinity estimate for the Fab clone displayed on the surface of the phage. depict results from a phage competition assay demonstrating the binding of polished h2G9.K4G1 variants L1 D28E D28S G29A G29S H2 C52aA C52aS N54A N54S H3 D95E D95S G96A and G96S against human Bv8. depict results from a phage competition assay demonstrating the binding of affinity improved h2G9.K4G1.Polish variants h2G9.K4G1.v27 v52 v55 v63 v64 v67 v77 v80 from L1 L2 soft randomized library h2G9.K4G1.v19 v25 v37 v65 v73 v75 v77. v92 from H1 H2 soft randomized library against human Bv8.

For binding affinity determinations of anti Bv8 antibodies Fab or IgG Surface Plasmon Resonance SRP measurement with a BIAcore 3000 instrument was used. Briefly CM5 biosensor chip was activated with EDC and NHS reagents according to the supplier s instructions and human Bv8 PeproTech or Cynomologus Monkey Genentech PUR21590 was coupled to achieve approximately 150 response units RU then following by blocking un reacted groups with 1M ethanolamine. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of anti Bv8 Fabs 0.19 nM to 25 nM or IgGs 0.019 nM to 10 nM were injected in HBS P buffer 0.01M HEPES pH 7.4 0.15M NaCl 0.005 surfactant P20 at 25 C. with a flow rate of 30 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k were calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 . The equilibrium dissociation constant K was calculated as the ratio k k. See . The results show that the humanized anti Bv8 antibodies h2G9.K4G1.v19 and h2G9.K4G1.v55 bind to human and cyno Bv8 at least two fold tighter than the chimeric 2G9 anti Bv8 antibody.

ACE cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well in 6 well plates in growth medium. For inhibition assay anti Bv8 antibodies were added at indicated concentrations g mL first. After 0.5 1 hr human Bv8 Peprotech was then added to a final concentration of 10 nM. After 6 days cells were dissociated by adding 1 ml of 2 Trypsin GIBCO to each well and duplicated wells were counted using Z2 coulter particle count and size analyzer Beckman Coulter . See and . shows that humanized anti Bv8 antibodies h2G9K4G1.v19 h2G9K4G1.v52 h2G9K4G1.v55 and h2G9K4G1.v73 showed significant improvement in blocking human Bv8 induced ACE proliferation.

NUNC 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates NUNC Roskilde Denmark were coated with chimeric 2B9 IgG at 1 g mL in PBS overnight and then blocked for an hour at room temperature with PBST buffer 0.5 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS . Biotinylation of human Bv8 was prepared using EZ link Sulfo NHS LC Biotin Catalog 21335 Pierce Rockford Ill. reagent in a molar ratio of 1 4 HuBv8 biotin .

To determine the amount of biotinylated human Bv8 in the competition assay threefold serially diluted biotinylated human Bv8 from 100 nM to 0.04 nM were added to the antibody coated plates for 15 minutes. Then the plates were washed with PBT buffer PBS and 0.05 Tween 20 . Bound biotinylated were detected using streptavidin which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase Catalog 21126 Pierce Rockford Ill. and diluted 1 2500 in PBST buffer. After 45 minutes of incubation the plate was washed and 100 L of tetramethylbenzidine R D Systems was added to each well for approximately 5 minutes to induce signal revelation. When blue coloration appeared 100 L of phosphoric acid at 1 M was added to each well to stop the revelation process. The optical density was read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.

To map the Bv8 antibody epitopes with chimeric 2B9 threefold serial dilutions of IgGs chimeric 2B9 chimeric 3F1 chimeric 2D3 chimeric 2G9 and control IgG were first incubated with 2 nM biotinylated human Bv8 determined by the above binding assay in PBST buffer for 1 2 hours at room temperature and then transferring it onto antibody chimeric 2B9 IgG 1 g mL coated plate for 15 min. Then the plate was washed with PBT buffer and the amount of biotinylated human Bv8 bound to chimeric 2B9 IgG on the plate was detected by the protocols as described above.

In the competition assay chimeric 3F1 and chimeric 2G9 antibodies competed with chimeric 2B9 binding to human Bv8 suggesting that both antibodies have overlapping epitopes with chimeric 2B9. However chimeric 2D3 only showed partially competed with chimeric 2B9 antibody binding to human Bv8 suggesting that chimeric 2D3 antibody may have distinct epitope s from chimeric 2B9 as well as chimeric 3F1 and chimeric 2G9 antibodies .
