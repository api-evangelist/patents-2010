Field service operations may be any operation in which companies dispatch technicians and or other staff to perform certain activities for example installations services and or repairs. Field service operations may exist in various industries examples of which include but are not limited to network installations utility installations security systems construction medical equipment heating ventilating and air conditioning HVAC and the like.

An example of a field service operation in the construction industry is a so called locate and marking operation also commonly referred to more simply as a locate operation or sometimes merely as a locate . In a typical locate operation a locate technician visits a work site in which there is a plan to disturb the ground e.g. excavate dig one or more holes and or trenches bore etc. so as to determine a presence or an absence of one or more underground facilities such as various types of utility cables and pipes in a dig area to be excavated or disturbed at the work site. In some instances a locate operation may be requested for a design project in which there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground but nonetheless information about a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities at a work site may be valuable to inform a planning permitting and or engineering design phase of a future construction project.

In many states an excavator who plans to disturb ground at a work site is required by law to notify any potentially affected underground facility owners prior to undertaking an excavation activity. Advanced notice of excavation activities may be provided by an excavator or another party by contacting a one call center. One call centers typically are operated by a consortium of underground facility owners for the purposes of receiving excavation notices and in turn notifying facility owners and or their agents of a plan to excavate. As part of an advanced notification excavators typically provide to the one call center various information relating to the planned activity including a location e.g. address of the work site and a description of the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed at the work site.

A locate operation typically is initiated as a result of an excavator providing an excavation notice to a one call center. An excavation notice also is commonly referred to as a locate request and may be provided by the excavator to the one call center via an electronic mail message information entry via a website maintained by the one call center or a telephone conversation between the excavator and a human operator at the one call center. The locate request may include an address or some other location related information describing the geographic location of a work site at which the excavation is to be performed as well as a description of the dig area e.g. a text description such as its location relative to certain landmarks and or its approximate dimensions within which there is a plan to disturb the ground at the work site. One call centers similarly may receive locate requests for design projects for which as discussed above there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground .

Once facilities implicated by the locate request are identified by a one call center the one call center generates a locate request ticket also known as a locate ticket or simply a ticket . The locate request ticket essentially constitutes an instruction to inspect a work site and typically identifies the work site of the proposed excavation or design and a description of the dig area typically lists on the ticket all of the underground facilities that may be present at the work site e.g. by providing a member code for the facility owner of an underground facility and may also include various other information relevant to the proposed excavation or design e.g. the name of the excavation company a name of a property owner or party contracting the excavation company to perform the excavation etc. . The one call center sends the ticket to one or more underground facility owners and or one or more locate service providers who may be acting as contracted agents of the facility owners so that they can conduct a locate and marking operation to verify a presence or absence of the underground facilities in the dig area. For example in some instances a given underground facility owner may operate its own fleet of locate technicians in which case the one call center may send the ticket to the underground facility owner. In other instances a given facility owner may contract with a locate service provider to receive locate request tickets and perform a locate and marking operation in response to received tickets on their behalf.

Upon receiving the locate request a locate service provider or a facility owner hereafter referred to as a ticket recipient may dispatch a locate technician to the work site of planned excavation to determine a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities in the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed. A typical first step for the locate technician includes utilizing an underground facility locate device which is an instrument or set of instruments also referred to commonly as a locate set for detecting facilities that are concealed in some manner such as cables and pipes that are located underground. The locate device is employed by the technician to verify the presence or absence of underground facilities indicated in the locate request ticket as potentially present in the dig area e.g. via the facility owner member codes listed in the ticket . This process is often referred to as a locate operation. 

In one example of a locate operation an underground facility locate device is used to detect electromagnetic fields that are generated by an applied signal provided along a length of a target facility to be identified. In this example a locate device may include both a signal transmitter to provide the applied signal e.g. which is coupled by the locate technician to a tracer wire disposed along a length of a facility and a signal receiver which is generally a hand held apparatus carried by the locate technician as the technician walks around the dig area to search for underground facilities. The transmitter is connected via a connection point to a target object in this example underground facility located in the ground and generates the applied signal coupled to the underground facility via the connection point e.g. to a tracer wire along the facility resulting in the generation of a magnetic field. The magnetic field in turn is detected by the locate receiver which itself may include one or more detection antenna. The locate receiver indicates a presence of a facility when it detects electromagnetic fields arising from the applied signal. Conversely the absence of a signal detected by the locate receiver generally indicates the absence of the target facility.

In yet another example a locate device employed for a locate operation may include a single instrument similar in some respects to a conventional metal detector. In particular such an instrument may include an oscillator to generate an alternating current that passes through a coil which in turn produces a first magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is in close proximity to the coil e.g. if an underground facility having a metal component is below near the coil of the instrument eddy currents are induced in the metal and the metal produces its own magnetic field which in turn affects the first magnetic field. The instrument may include a second coil to measure changes to the first magnetic field thereby facilitating detection of metallic objects.

In addition to the locate operation the locate technician also generally performs a marking operation in which the technician marks the presence and in some cases the absence of a given underground facility in the dig area based on the various signals detected or not detected during the locate operation. For this purpose the locate technician conventionally utilizes a marking device to dispense a marking material on for example the ground pavement or other surface along a detected underground facility. Marking material may be any material substance compound and or element used or which may be used separately or in combination to mark signify and or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include but are not limited to paint chalk dye and or iron. Marking devices such as paint marking wands and or paint marking wheels provide a convenient method of dispensing marking materials onto surfaces such as onto the surface of the ground or pavement.

In the mechanical actuation system of the marking device includes an actuator or mechanical trigger proximate to the handle that is actuated triggered by the technician e.g. via pulling depressing or squeezing with fingers hand . The actuator is connected to a mechanical coupler e.g. a rod disposed inside and along a length of the elongated shaft . The coupler is in turn connected to an actuation mechanism at the distal end of the shaft which mechanism extends outward from the shaft in the direction of the spray nozzle . Thus the actuator the mechanical coupler and the actuation mechanism constitute the mechanical actuation system of the marking device .

In some environments arrows flags darts or other types of physical marks may be used to mark the presence or absence of an underground facility in a dig area in addition to or as an alternative to a material applied to the ground such as paint chalk dye tape along the path of a detected utility. The marks resulting from any of a wide variety of materials and or objects used to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities generally are referred to as locate marks. Often different color materials and or physical objects may be used for locate marks wherein different colors correspond to different utility types. For example the American Public Works Association APWA has established a standardized color coding system for utility identification for use by public agencies utilities contractors and various groups involved in ground excavation e.g. red electric power lines and cables blue potable water orange telecommunication lines yellow gas oil steam . In some cases the technician also may provide one or more marks to indicate that no facility was found in the dig area sometimes referred to as a clear .

As mentioned above the foregoing activity of identifying and marking a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities generally is referred to for completeness as a locate and marking operation. However in light of common parlance adopted in the construction industry and or for the sake of brevity one or both of the respective locate and marking functions may be referred to in some instances simply as a locate operation or a locate i.e. without making any specific reference to the marking function . Accordingly it should be appreciated that any reference in the relevant arts to the task of a locate technician simply as a locate operation or a locate does not necessarily exclude the marking portion of the overall process. At the same time in some contexts a locate operation is identified separately from a marking operation wherein the former relates more specifically to detection related activities and the latter relates more specifically to marking related activities.

Inaccurate locating and or marking of underground facilities can result in physical damage to the facilities property damage and or personal injury during the excavation process that in turn can expose a facility owner or contractor to significant legal liability. When underground facilities are damaged and or when property damage or personal injury results from damaging an underground facility during an excavation the excavator may assert that the facility was not accurately located and or marked by a locate technician while the locate contractor who dispatched the technician may in turn assert that the facility was indeed properly located and marked. Proving whether the underground facility was properly located and marked can be difficult after the excavation or after some damage e.g. a gas explosion because in many cases the physical locate marks e.g. the marking material or other physical marks used to mark the facility on the surface of the dig area will have been disturbed or destroyed during the excavation process and or damage resulting from excavation .

Previous efforts at documenting locate operations have focused primarily on locate devices that employ electromagnetic fields to determine the presence of an underground facility. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 576 973 naming inventor Alan Haddy and entitled Apparatus and Method for Obtaining Geographical Positional Data for an Object Located Underground hereafter Haddy is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator that receives and stores data from a global positioning system GPS to identify the position of the locate device as an underground object e.g. a cable is detected by the locate device. Haddy notes that by recording geographical position data relating to the detected underground object there is no need to physically mark the location of the underground object on the ground surface and the recorded position data may be used in the future to re locate the underground object.

Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 7 319 387 naming inventors Willson et al. and entitled GPS Interface for Locating Device hereafter Willson is directed to a locate device for locating position markers i.e. passive antennas that reflect back RF signals and which are installed along buried utilities. In Willson a GPS device may be communicatively coupled to the locate device or alternatively provided as an integral part of the locate device to store GPS coordinate data associated with position markers detected by the locate device. Electronic memory is provided in the locate device for storing a data record of the GPS coordinate data and the data record may be uploaded to a remote computer and used to update a mapping database for utilities.

U.S. Publication No. 2006 0282280 naming inventors Stotz et al. and entitled Ticket and Data Management hereafter Stotz also is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator including a GPS receiver. Upon detection of the presence of a utility line Stotz locate device can update ticket data with GPS coordinates for the detected utility line. Once the locate device has updated the ticket data the reconfigured ticket data may be transmitted to a network.

U.S. Publication No. 2007 0219722 naming inventors Sawyer Jr. et al. and entitled System and Method for Collecting and Updating Geographical Data hereafter Sawyer is directed to collecting and recording data representative of the location and characteristics of utilities and infrastructure in the field for creating a grid or map. Sawyer employs a field data collection unit including a locating pole that is placed on top of or next to a utility to be identified and added to the grid or map. The locating pole includes an antenna coupled to a location determination system such as a GPS unit to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the utility under or next to the end of the locating pole. The data gathered by the field data collection unit is sent to a server to provide a permanent record that may be used for damage prevention and asset management operations.

Applicants have recognized and appreciated that uncertainties which may be attendant to locate and marking operations may be significantly reduced by collecting various information particularly relating to the marking operation rather than merely focusing on information relating to detection of underground facilities via a locate device. In many instances excavators arriving to a work site have only physical locate marks on which to rely to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities and they are not generally privy to information that may have been collected previously during the locate operation. Accordingly the integrity and accuracy of the physical locate marks applied during a marking operation arguably is significantly more important in connection with reducing risk of damage and or injury during excavation than the location of where an underground facility was detected via a locate device during a locate operation.

More specifically Applicants have recognized and appreciated that conventional techniques for using a locate device to detect underground facilities are sometimes tentative and typically iterative in nature and use of locate devices with GPS capabilities may result in redundant spurious and or incomplete geographic location data collected by such devices. For example during a typical locate operation a technician attempting to locate an underground facility with a locate device often needs to sweep an appreciable area around a suspected underground facility and make multiple passes with the locate device over the underground facility to obtain meaningful detection signals. Furthermore the technician often needs to rely significantly on visual observations of the area including relevant landmarks such as facility connections to buildings transformer boxes maintenance public access points curbs sidewalks roadways etc. to effectively deduce a sensible path of an underground facility to be located. The foregoing is particularly true if at some point during the locate operation the technician loses a signal from an underground facility in the process of being detected e.g. due to a broken transmitter circuit path from a damaged tracer wire and loss of the transmitter test signal . In view of the foregoing it may be readily appreciated that collecting and logging geographic location information throughout this process may result in excessive and or imprecise data or in some instances incomplete relevant data e.g. in the case of signal loss broken tracer wire from which it may be difficult to cull the data that is truly complete and representative of where the underground facility ultimately was detected.

Furthermore Applicants have recognized and appreciated that the location at which an underground facility ultimately is detected during a locate operation is not always where the technician physically marks the ground pavement or other surface during a marking operation in fact technician imprecision or negligence as well as various ground conditions and or different operating conditions amongst different locate device may in some instances result in significant discrepancies between detected location and physical locate marks. Accordingly having documentation e.g. an electronic record of where physical locate marks were actually dispensed i.e. what an excavator encounters when arriving to a work site is notably more relevant to the assessment of liability in the event of damage and or injury than where an underground facility was detected prior to marking.

Examples of marking devices configured to collect some types of information relating specifically to marking operations are provided in U.S. publication no. 2008 0228294 A1 published Sep. 18 2008 filed Mar. 13 2007 and entitled Marking System and Method With Location and or Time Tracking and U.S. publication no. 2008 0245299 A1 published Oct. 9 2008 filed Apr. 4 2007 and entitled Marking System and Method both of which publications are incorporated herein by reference. These publications describe amongst other things collecting information relating to the geographic location time and or characteristics e.g. color type of dispensed marking material from a marking device and generating an electronic record based on this collected information. Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting information relating to both geographic location and color of dispensed marking material provides for automated correlation of geographic information for a locate mark to facility type e.g. red electric power lines and cables blue potable water orange telecommunication lines yellow gas oil steam in contrast in conventional locate devices equipped with GPS capabilities as discussed above there is no apparent automated provision for readily linking GPS information for a detected facility to the type of facility detected. Applicants have further appreciated that building a more comprehensive electronic record of information relating to marking operations further facilitates ensuring the accuracy of such operations.

In view of the foregoing various embodiments of the present invention are directed to marking apparatus with enhanced features and associated methods and systems to facilitate collection of a wide variety of information relating to a marking operation and provide for creation of a comprehensive and robust electronic record of a marking operation. Marking information relating to use of a marking device to perform a marking operation may be acquired from one or more of a variety of input devices in any of a variety of manners logged stored in local memory of a marking device formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the marking device itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server for storage processing and or analysis.

In some exemplary embodiments described in detail herein a marking device may include one or more environmental sensors and or operational sensors and the marking information may include environmental information and operational information derived from such sensors. Environmental and or operational information may be used to control operation of the marking device assess out of tolerance conditions in connection with use of the marking device and or provide alerts or other feedback. In yet other embodiments additional enhancements are disclosed relating to improving the determination of a location e.g. GPS coordinates of a dispensing tip of the marking device during use.

In other embodiments a marking device may be operated in a solo mode or a group mode. In particular in a solo mode the marking device may be operated as an individual independent device to collect store and or transmit data whereas in group mode a marking device may act as a worker device or a leader device to facilitate consolidation of data collected by multiple devices e.g. relating to a same ticket at a single one of the devices at a host server or at any other suitable location.

In yet other embodiments a marking device may be equipped with an enhanced user interface having tactile functionality in particular the marking device may include one or more tactile indicators e.g. vibrating devices disposed for example in a handle joy stick actuator or elsewhere on the device to provide a tactile indication to a technician using the marking device e.g. as feedback in connection with an operating mode operating condition environmental condition etc. .

During and or following collection and or storage of information regarding the marking operation data compiled in one or more electronic records associated with the marking operation may be accessed processed and or analyzed to provide further information relating to the performance of the marking operation. For example in other embodiments disclosed herein data from one or more electronic records of the marking operation is processed so as to electronically render visually recreate the marking operation e.g. on a display device associated with the marking device or other display device . Electronic renderings may be generated statically e.g. in which all available data in an electronic record is rendered essentially simultaneously on an available display field or in an animated time sequenced recreation of the marking operation e.g. based on at least timing and geographic location information in the electronic record once an electronic record is generated. In yet another exemplary implementation various information to be logged in an electronic record may be passed transmitted in essentially real time to one or more display devices to facilitate an essentially real time electronic rendering on an available display field of a marking operation in process.

It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. In particular all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. It should also be appreciated that terminology explicitly employed herein that also may appear in any disclosure incorporated by reference should be accorded a meaning most consistent with the particular concepts disclosed herein.

Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to and embodiments of inventive marking apparatus having enhanced features for underground facility marking operations and associated methods and systems. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.

In some embodiments of the present invention a marking device employed by a locate technician to dispense marking material is particularly configured to acquire marking information relating to a marking operation based at least in part on actuations of the marking device and create an electronic record of at least some of the marking information. As discussed in greater detail below examples of marking information relating to the marking operation that may be logged into an electronic record may include but are not limited to 

Marking information including any or all of the foregoing types of information may be logged stored in local memory of a marking device formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the marking device itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server for storage processing and or analysis. In particular environmental and or operational information may be used to control operation of the marking device assess out of tolerance conditions in connection with use of the marking device and or provide alerts or other feedback. In yet other embodiments operational information may be analyzed and processed so as to improve a determination of a location e.g. GPS coordinates of a dispensing tip of the marking device during use.

In other embodiments a marking device may be configured to operate in multiple different modes so as to collect various information relating not only to a marking operation itself but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig area in which the marking operation is performed. For example in one implementation the marking device may be configured to operate in a first marking mode as well as a second landmark identification mode or more simply landmark mode . In a marking mode marking material may be dispensed with respective actuations of the marking device and various marking information transmitted and or stored in an electronic record attendant to this process. Alternatively in a landmark mode marking material is not necessarily dispensed with an actuation of the marking device and in some instances the dispensing of marking material is specifically precluded instead a technician positions the marking device proximate to an environmental landmark of interest and upon actuation the marking device collects various information about the landmark hereafter referred to as landmark information . As discussed in greater detail below landmark information may include but is not limited to geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark and a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark.

In other embodiments a marking device may be operated in a solo mode or a group mode. In particular in a solo mode the marking device may be operated as an individual independent device to collect store and or transmit data whereas in group mode a marking device may act as a worker device or a leader device to facilitate consolidation of data collected by multiple devices e.g. relating to a same ticket to a host server.

In yet other embodiments a marking device may be equipped with an enhanced user interface having tactile functionality in particular the marking device may include one or more tactile indicators e.g. vibrating devices disposed for example in a handle joy stick actuator or elsewhere on the device to provide a tactile indication to a technician using the marking device e.g. as feedback in connection with an operating mode operating condition environmental condition etc. .

In various implementations of the methods and apparatus described herein data from one or more electronic records including one or more pieces of marking information and or one or more pieces of landmark information may be processed and analyzed to provide insight into the marking operation. In one embodiment a computer generated image or other visual representation based on the marking information and or landmark information may be electronically rendered for example this visual representation may provide electronic indications electronic locate marks of the relative placement of marking material dispensed during a marking operation and electronic locate marks corresponding to different types of facilities may be color coded. Additionally electronic identifiers e.g. icons shapes symbols patterns etc. of one or more environmental landmarks may be included in a visual representation alone or together with electronic locate marks. Such a visual representation may be used for example to provide immediate feedback to the locate technician e.g. via a display device associated with the marking device provide essentially real time feedback to a supervisor monitoring the technician s work from a remote location provide a visual record of the marking information and or landmark information e.g. for archiving purposes once one or more electronic records are generated and or to verify the quality e.g. accuracy and completeness of work performed during a locate and marking operation.

As shown in in one embodiment marking device includes control electronics the components of which are powered by a power source . Power source may be any power source that is suitable for use in a portable device such as but not limited to one or more rechargeable batteries one or more non rechargeable batteries a solar photovoltaic panel a standard AC power plug feeding an AC to DC converter and the like.

The marking device is configured to hold a marking dispenser which as shown in is loaded into a marking material holder of the marking device . In one exemplary implementation the marking dispenser is an aerosol paint canister that contains paint however it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited in this respect as a marking material dispensed by the marking device may be any material substance compound and or element used to mark signify and or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include but are not limited to paint chalk dye and or marking powder.

As also shown in in one embodiment control electronics of marking device may include but are not limited to a processor at least a portion of an actuation system another portion of which may include one or more mechanical elements a local memory a communication interface a user interface a timing system and a location tracking system .

The processor may be any general purpose processor controller or microcontroller device. Local memory may be any volatile or non volatile data storage device such as but not limited to a random access memory RAM device and a removable memory device e.g. a universal serial bus USB flash drive a multimedia card MMC a secure digital card SD a compact flash card CF etc. . As discussed further below the local memory may store a marking data algorithm which may be a set of processor executable instructions that when executed by the processor causes the processor to control various other components of the marking device so as to generate an electronic record of a marking operation which record also may be stored in the local memory and or transmitted in essentially real time as it is being generated or after completion of a marking operation to a remote device e.g. remote computer .

In one exemplary implementation a Linux based processing system for embedded handheld and or wireless devices may be employed in the marking device to implement various components of the control electronics . For example the Fingertip4 processing system including a Marvell PXA270 processor and available from InHand Electronics Inc. www.inhandelectronics.com products fingertip4 may be used. In addition to the PXA270 processor e.g. serving as the processor the Fingertip4 includes flash memory and SDRAM e.g. serving as local memory multiple serial ports a USB port and other I O interfaces e.g. to facilitate interfacing with one or more input devices and other components of the marking device supports a variety of wired and wireless interfaces WiFi Bluetooth GPS Ethernet any IEEE 802.11 interface or any other suitable wireless interface to facilitate implementation of the communication interface and connects to a wide variety of LCD displays to facilitate implementation of a user interface display .

Communication interface of marking device may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between marking device and an external or remote device such as a remote computing device that is elsewhere in the dig area i.e. not a part of the marking device or outside the dig area. For example data that is provided by components of data acquisition system and or stored in local memory e.g. one or more electronic records may be transmitted via communication interface to a remote computer such as remote computer for processing. Examples of wired communication interfaces may include but are not limited to USB ports RS232 connectors RJ45 connectors Ethernet and any combination thereof. Examples of wireless communication interfaces may include but are not limited to an Intranet connection Internet Bluetooth technology Wi Fi Wi Max IEEE 802.11 technology e.g. operating at a minimum bandwidth of 54 Mbps or any other suitable bandwidth radio frequency RF Infrared Data Association IrDA compatible protocols Local Area Networks LAN Wide Area Networks WAN Shared Wireless Access Protocol SWAP any combination thereof and other types of wireless networking protocols. The wireless interface may be capable of capturing signals that reflect a user s intent. For example the wireless interface may include a microphone that can capture a user s intent by capturing the user s audible commands. Alternatively the wireless interface may interact with a device that monitors a condition of the user such as eye movement brain activity and or heart rate.

User interface of marking device may be any mechanism or combination of mechanisms by which a user may operate data acquisition system and by which information that is generated by data acquisition system may be presented to the user. For example user interface may include but is not limited to a display device including integrated displays and external displays such as Heads Up Displays HUDs a touch screen one or more manual pushbuttons a microphone to provide for audible commands one or more light emitting diode LED indicators one or more toggle switches a keypad an audio output e.g. speaker buzzer and alarm and any combination thereof. In one implementation the user interface includes a menu on button to power up the marking device and provide a menu driven graphical user interface GUI displayed by the display device e.g. menu items and or icons displayed on the display device and navigated by the technician via a joystick or a set of four up down left right buttons as well as a select ok button to take some action pursuant to the selection of a menu item icon. As described below the display may also be used in some embodiments of the invention to display information relating to a placement of marking material in a dig area a location of an underground facility in a dig area or any other suitable information that may be displayed based on information acquired to create an electronic record .

In various embodiments the one or more interfaces of the marking device including the communication interface and user interface may be used as input devices to receive information to be stored in the memory as part of an electronic record of a marking operation. In some cases marking information received via the interface s e.g. via the communication interface may include ticket information regarding underground facilities to be marked during a marking operation. As another example using an interface such as the user interface service related information may be input including an identifier for the marking device used by the technician an identifier for a technician and or an identifier for the technician s employer. Alternatively some or all of the service related information similarly may be received via the communication interface and likewise some or all of the ticket information may be received via the user interface .

The actuation system of marking device shown in the block diagram of may include both electrical and mechanical elements according to various embodiments discussed in further detail below and for purposes of illustration is shown in as included as part of the control electronics . The actuation system may include a mechanical and or electrical actuator mechanism e.g. see the actuator shown in to provide one or more signals or stimuli as an input to the actuation system . Upon receiving one or more signals or stimuli e.g. actuation triggering by a locate technician or other user the actuation system causes marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser . In various embodiments the actuation system may employ any of a variety of mechanical and or electrical techniques e.g. one or more switches or other circuit components a dedicated processor or the processor executing instructions one or more mechanical elements various types of transmitters and receivers or any combination of the foregoing as would be readily appreciated by those of skill in the relevant arts to cause the marking dispenser to dispense marking material in response to one or more signals or stimuli. The actuation system also provides one or more output signals in the form of an actuation signal to the processor to indicate one or more actuations of the marking device in response to which the processor may acquire collect various marking information and log data into the electronic record . Additional details of exemplary actuation system implementations are provided below in connection with .

In some embodiments the actuation system may be configured so as not to cause marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser in response to one or more signals or stimuli rather the actuation system may merely facilitate a logging of data from one or more input devices in response to operation of an actuator trigger without necessarily dispensing marking material. In some instances this may facilitate simulation of a marking operation i.e. simulating the dispensing of marking material by providing an actuation signal to the processor indicating one or more simulated actuation events in response to which the processor may cause the logging of various data for creating an electronic record without any marking material actually being dispensed.

Location tracking system of marking device constitutes another type of input device that provides marking information and may include any device that can determine its geographical location to a certain degree of accuracy. For example location tracking system may include a global positioning system GPS receiver or a global navigation satellite system GNSS receiver. A GPS receiver may provide for example any standard format data stream such as a National Marine Electronics Association NMEA data stream or other data formats. An error correction component may be but is not limited to any mechanism for improving the accuracy of the geographic information provided by location tracking system for example error correction component may be an algorithm for correcting any offsets e.g. due to local disturbances in the atmosphere in the geo location data of location tracking system . While shown as part of a local location tracking system of the marking device error correction component alternatively may reside at a remote computing device such as remote computer . In other embodiments location tracking system may include any device or mechanism that may determine location by any other means such as performing triangulation by use of cellular radiotelephone towers.

In one exemplary implementation the location tracking system may include an ISM300F2 05 V0005 GPS module available from Inventek Systems LLC of Westford Mass. see www.inventeksys.com html ism300f2 c5 v0005.html . The Inventek GPS module includes two UARTs universal asynchronous receiver transmitter for communication with the processor supports both the SIRF Binary and NMEA 0183 protocols depending on firmware selection and has an information update rate of 5 Hz. A variety of geographic location information may be requested by the processor and provided by the GPS module to the processor including but not limited to time coordinated universal time UTC date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values and dilution of precision values. Accordingly it should be appreciated that in some implementations the location tracking system may provide a wide variety of geographic information as well as timing information e.g. one or more time stamps to the processor .

In another embodiment location tracking system may not reside locally on marking device . Instead location tracking system may reside on any on site computer which serves as a location reference point to which the location of marking device may be correlated by any other means such as but not limited to by a triangulation technique between the on site computer and marking device .

With respect to other input devices of the marking device that may provide marking information the control electronics may also include a timing system having an internal clock not shown such as a crystal oscillator device for processor . Additionally timing system may include a mechanism for registering time with a certain degree of accuracy e.g. accuracy to the minute second or millisecond and may also include a mechanism for registering the calendar date. In various implementations the timing system may be capable of registering the time and date using its internal clock or alternatively timing system may receive its time and date information from the location tracking system e.g. a GPS system or from an external timing system such as a remote computer or network via communication interface . In yet other implementations a dedicated timing system for providing timing information to be logged in an electronic record may be optional and timing information for logging into an electronic record may be obtained from the location tracking system e.g. GPS latitude and longitude coordinates with a corresponding time stamp . Timing information may include but is not limited to a period of time timestamp information date and or elapsed time.

Marking material detection mechanism of the marking device shown in is another type of input device that provides marking information and may be any mechanism or mechanisms for determining a presence or absence of a marking dispenser in or otherwise coupled to the marking device as well as determining certain attributes characteristics of the marking material within marking dispenser when the dispenser is placed in or coupled to the marking device. As shown in in some embodiments the marking material detection mechanism may be disposed generally in an area proximate to a marking material holder in which a marking dispenser may be placed.

For example in one embodiment the marking material detection mechanism may include one or more switch devices e.g. a make break single pole single throw contact switch disposed at one or more points along the marking material holder and electrically coupled to the processor . The switch device s may also be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage such that when the switch device is in a first state e.g. closed making contact the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor e.g. via an I O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to or is periodically monitored by the processor and when the switch is in a second state e.g. open no contact the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor . When the marking dispenser is present in the holder the switch device s is in one of two possible states and when there is no marking dispenser the switch device s is in another of the two possible states e.g. the marking dispenser when present may depress the switch device s so as to make contact and pass the ground DC voltage to the processor . In this manner the marking material detection mechanism may provide a signal to the processor indicating the presence or absence of the marking dispenser in the marking device .

The marking material detection mechanism also or alternatively may include a barcode reader to read barcode data from a dispenser and or a radio frequency identification RFID reader for reading information from an RFID tag that is provided on marking dispenser . The RFID tag may include for example a unique serial number or universal product code UPC that corresponds to the brand and or type of marking material in marking dispenser . The type of information that may be encoded within the RFID tag on marking dispenser may include product specific information for the marking material but any information of interest may be stored on an RFID tag. For example user specific information and or inventory related information may be stored on each RFID tag for a marking dispenser to facilitate inventory tracking of marking materials. In particular an identifier for a technician may be stored on an RFID tag when the technician is provided with a marking dispenser and information relating to weight amount dispensed and or amount remaining may be written to the RFID tag whenever the marking dispenser is used.

In one exemplary implementation the marking material detection mechanism may include a Micro RWD MIFARE ICODE RFID reader module available from IB Technology Eccel Technology Ltd of Aylesbury Buckinghamshire UK see www.ibtechnology.co.uk products icode.htm . The Micro RWD reader module includes an RS232 communication interface to facilitate communication between the processor and the reader module e.g. via messages sent as a string of ASCII characters and supports both reading information from an RFID tag attached to a marking dispenser as well as writing information to an RFID tag attached to the marking dispenser. In one aspect of an exemplary implementation an antenna constituted by one or more turns of wire e.g. two turns of awg 26 wire 6.5 cm in diameter about 1 uH is coupled to the Micro RWD reader module and disposed in the marking material holder of the marking device see proximate to a marking dispenser when placed in the holder so as to capture close near field signals e.g. from an RFID tag on the dispenser within about 2 inches and exclude far field signals. In another aspect the Micro RWD reader module may be configured to read RFID tags having an ICODE SLI format e.g. ISO 15693 ICODE SLI . In yet another aspect an RFID tag may be affixed to an aerosol paint can serving as the marking dispenser such that the tag conforms to a plastic cap of the paint can and is disposed at a particular location relative to a notch in the cap e.g. 90 degrees 15 degrees from the notch that allows access to the spray nozzle of the can and is in a relatively predictable position substantially aligned with the antenna when the paint can is placed in the marking material holder . Examples of RFID tags suitable for this purpose are available from BCS Solutions Inc. see www.bcssolutions.com solutions rfid and include but are not limited to the HF Bullseye Wet Inlay SLA Round 40.

In yet other embodiments marking material detection mechanism may alternatively or further be configured to detect properties of marking material as it is dispensed. For example the marking material detection mechanism may include one or more of an optical sensor an olfactory sensor an auditory sensor e.g. a microphone a weight sensor and any combination thereof. For example in one embodiment an optical sensor in the marking device may be used to identify the composition and or type of marking material in the marking dispenser by analyzing light reflected by the material as it is dispensed. Similarly an olfactory sensor may be used to identify one or more characteristics of the marking material based on an odor profile of the material and an auditory sensor may be used to identify the difference between paint being sprayed from an aerosol can and aerosol without paint being sprayed from a can e.g. as the dispenser becomes emptied of paint .

In one embodiment information provided by one or more input devices of the marking device e.g. the timing system the location tracking system the marking material detection mechanism the user interface the communication interface is acquired and logged stored in memory upon actuation of the actuation system e.g. triggering an actuator . Some embodiments of the invention may additionally or alternatively acquire log information from one or more input devices at one or more times during or throughout an actuation such as when a technician is holding a mechanical or electrical actuator for some period of time and moving to dispense marking material in a line e.g. see . In various aspects of such embodiments marking information derived from one or more input devices may be collected at a start time of an actuation at one or more times during an actuation and in some cases at regular intervals during an actuation e.g. several times per second once per second once every few seconds . Further some marking information may be collected at an end of an actuation such as time information that may indicate a duration of an actuation.

Additionally it should be appreciated that while some marking information may be received via one or more input devices at the start of each marking operation and upon successive actuations of the marking device in other cases some marking information may be collected by or provided to the marking device once prior to a marking operation e.g. on power up or reset of the marking device as part of an electronic instruction or dispatch by a locate company and or in response to a request query from a locate technician and stored in local memory for later incorporation into an electronic record. For example prior to a given marking operation and one or more actuations of the marking device ticket information and or service related information may have already been received e.g. via the communication interface and or user interface and stored in local memory . Upon generation of an electronic record of a given marking operation information previously received via the interface s may be retrieved from the local memory if stored there initially and entered into an electronic record in some case together with information collected pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device. Alternatively ticket information and or service related information may be received via the interface s and stored in an entry in the electronic record directly in response to one or more actuations of the marking device e.g. without being first stored in local memory .

In sum according to embodiments of the present invention various marking information from one or more input devices regardless of how or when it is received may be stored in an electronic record of a marking operation in which at least some of the marking information is logged pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device.

In one embodiment the optional remote computer of the data acquisition system may be a centralized computer such as a central server of an underground facility locate service provider. In another embodiment remote computer may be a computer that is at or near the work site i.e. on site e.g. a computer that is present in a locate technician s vehicle.

Whether resident and or executed on either the marking device or the remote computer as noted above the marking data algorithm includes a set of processor executable instructions e.g. stored in memory such as local memory of the marking device that when executed by processor of the marking device or another processor processes information e.g. various marking information collected in response to e.g. during one or more actuations of the marking device and or in some cases before or after a given actuation or series of actuations. As also discussed above according to various embodiments the actuations of marking device may effect both dispensing marking material and logging of marking information or merely logging of marking information for other purposes e.g. simulating the dispensing of marking material without dispensing marking material. In either situation marking data algorithm when executed by the processor may cause the processor to perform collection logging storage creation of electronic records and in some instances further processing and analysis of various marking information with respect to marking device actuations. For example as discussed in further detail below in connection with the operations of marking data algorithm as effected by the processor may include but are not limited to the following 

It should also be appreciated that the marking data algorithm may include one or more adjustable parameters that govern various aspects of the collection and logging of marking information e.g. the rate at which various marking information is collected from one or more input devices and that these parameters may be adjusted or set for example by an administrator at a remote computer after which the marking data algorithm is downloaded to the marking device for execution by the processor . Alternatively in other implementations adjustable parameters of a marking data algorithm already resident on a marking device may in some cases be adjusted remotely via the communication interface or locally via the user interface.

While the functionality of various components of the marking device was discussed above in connection with shows some structural aspects of the marking device according to one embodiment. For example the marking device may include an elongated housing in which is disposed one or more elements of the actuation system one or more elements of the control electronics and the power source . Elongated housing may be hollow or may contain certain cavities or molded compartments for installing any components therein such as the various components of marking device that are shown in . The elongated housing and other structural elements associated with the housing as discussed below may be formed of any rigid semi rigid strong and lightweight material such as but not limited to molded plastic and aluminum.

Incorporated at a proximal end of elongated housing may be a handle which provides a convenient grip by which the user e.g. the locate technician may carry the marking device during use i.e. the exemplary marking device depicted in is intended to be a hand held device . In one implementation the power source may be provided in the form of a removable battery pack housing one or more rechargeable batteries that are connected in series or parallel in order to provide a DC voltage to marking device and disposed within a compartment in the handle . Such an arrangement facilitates use of conventional removable rechargeable battery packs often employed in a variety of cordless power tools in which the battery pack similarly is situated in a handle of the tool. It should be appreciated however that the power source in the form of a battery pack may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

As also shown in mounted near handle is user interface which may include a display . The display may be a touch screen display to facilitate interaction with a user technician and or the user interface also may include one or more buttons switches joysticks a keyboard and the like to facilitate entry of information by a user technician. One or more elements of the control electronics e.g. the processor memory communication interface and timing system also may be located in the proximal end of the elongated housing in the vicinity of the user interface and display . As with the power source it should be appreciated that one or more elements of the control electronics may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

In the embodiment of the location tracking system similarly may be positioned on the proximal end of the elongated housing to facilitate substantially unobstructed exposure to the atmosphere in particular as illustrated in the location tracking system may be situated on an a ground plane providing an electrical ground at least at the antenna frequency of the location tracking system e.g. at approximately 1.5 GHz that extends from the proximal end of the housing and is approximately parallel to the ground surface or pavement when the marking device is being normally operated by a technician so as to reduce signal modulation with subtle movements of the marking device .

As also shown in incorporated at the distal end of elongated housing is a marking dispenser holder for holding one or more marking dispensers e.g. an aerosol paint canister . Dispenser may be one or more replaceable dispensers or one or more reusable refillable dispensers including a fixed reservoir forming a part of the device or any other suitable dispenser. Also situated at the distal end of the housing is the marking material detection mechanism to detect a presence or absence of the marking dispenser in the marking material holder and or one or more characteristics of the marking material as well as an actuation mechanism which in some implementations may constitute part of the actuation system and be employed to interact with the marking dispenser so as to effect dispensing of the marking material .

With respect to the actuation system as shown in at least a portion of the actuation system is indicated generally along the length of the elongated housing for purposes of illustration. More specifically however in various implementations the actuation system may include multiple components disposed in various places in on or coupled to the marking device . For example in the embodiment of the actuation system includes an actuator which for example may be a mechanical mechanism provided at the handle in the form of a trigger that is pulled by a finger or hand of an user technician. The actuation system further includes the actuation mechanism disposed at the distal end of the marking device that is responsive to the actuator to dispense marking material. In general in various exemplary implementations as discussed in further detail below the actuation system may employ any of a variety of mechanical and or electrical techniques to cause the marking dispenser to dispense marking material in response to one or more signals or stimuli. In the embodiment shown in the signal stimulus is initially provided to the actuation system via the mechanical actuator i.e. a locate technician or other user triggers e.g. pulls depresses the actuator to provide a signal stimulus to the actuation system which in turn operates the actuation mechanism to dispense marking material in response to the signal stimulus.

In response to the signal stimulus provided by the actuator as discussed above the actuation system may also provide an actuation signal to the processor to indicate an actuation. As discussed in further detail below in connection with pursuant to the execution by the processor of the marking data algorithm the actuation signal may be used to cause the logging of information that is provided by one or more components of the marking device so as to generate an electronic record of the marking operation.

In one implementation the sensor may include a switch device e.g. a make break single pole single throw contact switch disposed along the handle of the marking device such that when pulled the actuator contacts e.g. depresses the switch causing a state of the switch to toggle. In another implementation the sensor may include a switch device such as a reed magnetic switch disposed at some point along the length of the elongated housing in such an implementation the mechanical coupler may have a magnet disposed along it at an appropriate position relative to the reed switch such that movement of the mechanical coupler upon actuation of the actuator causes a state of the reed switch to toggle. Electrically a switch device serving as the sensor may be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage such that when the switch device is in a first state e.g. closed making contact the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor e.g. via an I O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to or is periodically monitored by the processor and when the switch is in a second state e.g. open no contact the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor . In this manner the sensor may provide the actuation signal to the processor indicating actuation and release of the actuator .

Other examples of transmitter link receiver combinations include but are not limited to an acoustic transmitter link receiver e.g. a sound wave source that provides a sound wave of a certain tone duration and or amplitude when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding sound wave detector an optical transmitter link receiver e.g. a light or laser source that provides an optical signal of a certain wavelength duration and or amplitude when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding optical detector a fluid transmitter link receiver e.g. a fluid system that provides a fluid control output of a certain volume pressure and or duration when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding fluid sensor for sensing the presence of for example a short blast of water of a certain volume pressure and or duration to indicate an actuation the fluid system may be for example a closed loop system that has a source reservoir at the top of the marking device a fluid line in proximity with the fluid sensor a return reservoir for capturing water during the actuation process and appropriate pressure regulation and ducts for cycling water from the return reservoir back to the source reservoir and an air transmitter link receiver e.g. an air system that provides an air control output of a certain volume pressure and or duration when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding air sensor for sensing the presence of for example a blast or puff of air of a certain volume pressure and or duration to indicate an actuation .

While not explicitly shown in in yet other embodiments it should be appreciated that the sensor may be coupled to the processor to provide the actuation signal representing actuation release of the actuator and in turn the processor may provide a signal to the link transmitter such that dispensing of marking material may in part be under the control of the processor executing particular instructions for this purpose. More specifically while in some implementations dispensing of marking material may be directly responsive to actuation of the actuator and cease upon release of the actuator in other implementations dispensing of marking material may be initiated in some manner upon actuation of the actuator but then continued dispensing of marking material may not necessarily be dictated by continued actuation or release of the actuator. Rather the processor may provide one or more signals or commands to the link transmitter to govern dispensing of marking material in some manner that does not necessarily track each actuation and release of the actuator.

For example in one implementation the processor may execute instructions such that once the actuation signal from the sensor indicates actuation of the actuator the processor provides a signal to the link transmitter that causes dispensing of marking material for some predetermined or user defined amount of time irrespective of release of the actuator. Additionally or alternatively the processor may provide one or more signals to the link transmitter that causes dispensing of marking material for multiple discrete amounts of time with a single actuation e.g. three bursts of second each per actuation . From the foregoing it should be generally appreciated that a wide variety of marker sizes and patterns may be generated from the marking device in an automated or semi automated manner based on processor based control of the actuation system . It should also be appreciated that automated or semi automated processor based control of the dispensing of marking material may also govern in some fashion how how often and or what type of marking information is collected and logged to generate an electronic record of a marking operation as discussed further below in connection with .

Referring now to a perspective view of marking device when in use for marking a lines pattern is presented. In marking operations a lines pattern is typically the end product of a marking operation. This pattern extends the dotting pattern e.g. dotting pattern of so as to create lines e.g. a series of dashes that indicate the presence or absence of an underground facility. These lines subsequently provide important reference marks to an excavator so as to avoid damage to a facility during excavation activities or other disturbances of the ground. By way of example shows underground facility which may be any concealed facility such as an underground gas line water pipe sewer pipe power line telephone line cable television conduit and the like. also shows a lines pattern that is formed by multiple locate marks dispensed via marking device . A characteristic of locate marks of lines pattern is that each locate mark is formed by an extended burst of marking material e.g. a longer actuation of the marking device as compared with a dotting pattern. As with the dotting pattern shown in however each locate mark of the lines pattern shown in may correspond to one actuation of marking device . In some alternative implementations as discussed above a series of locate marks e.g. all three marks may be automatically generated by one actuation of marking device pursuant to processor based control of the actuation system.

In one embodiment of the present invention for generating an electronic record of a marking operation the processor of the marking device executing the marking data algorithm may collect various marking information and generate an electronic record having one or more actuation data sets respectively associated with one or more actuations act act act . . . act n and corresponding locate marks as shown in . Marking information may be collected and entered into such an electronic record at various times relative to the start time t and the end time t of a given actuation e.g. at t only at t only at both t and t at any time s between t and t and or before or after t and t.

Examples of marking information that generally but not necessarily is acquired with respect to t and t of each actuation and points between t and t actuation data may include but are not limited to 

Examples of marking information that may be acquired before during or after a given actuation or succession of actuations and also entered into an electronic record include but are not limited to 

In exemplary methods for generating an electronic record of marking operations according to some embodiments of the invention as discussed in greater detail below for a given actuation the processor may request the location tracking system to provide geographic information at one or more times during the actuation e.g. periodically at regular intervals . Thus an actuation data set of an electronic record for a given actuation of the marking device may have multiple pieces of geographic information and associated time stamps representing the location of the marking device at multiple times during a corresponding actuation. Additionally for a given actuation the processor also may request the marking material detection mechanism to provide marking material information as part of the actuation data set. The processor also may include ticket information and service related information which may be collected e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface before a corresponding actuation stored in memory and retrieved from the memory for entry into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation or collected and entered into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation.

While the collection and logging of marking information to generate an electronic record is discussed in some aspects for purposes of illustration in terms of actuation data sets i.e. a set of data that is associated and logged with a corresponding actuation of the marking device it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. More generally an electronic record of a marking operation may be generated in any of a variety of manners have a variety of file formats and or data structures and include any of a variety of marking information some of which may be germane to one or more actuations of the marking device and some of which may be common to multiple actuations or the overall marking operation in general .

In block of the process shown in ticket information and or service related information may be received e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface of marking device and this information optionally may be stored in whole or in part in local memory of the marking device. The ticket information and or service related information may be received electronically in any of a variety of formats and the processor may be configured to appropriately parse the information for subsequent entry into an electronic record.

For example in some embodiments the ticket information may be received as part of an electronic locate request ticket and individual respective pieces of ticket information e.g. ticket number work site address information requesting party etc. may be extracted or derived from the electronic locate request ticket. In other embodiments various aspects of ticket information may be input by a user technician via the user interface.

For example in block the process may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion in an electronic record and or selection by a user technician e.g. via the user interface of various information to be included in an electronic record as part of ticket information and or service related information . One example of such information may relate to a ground type in and around the work site dig area at which marking material is dispensed as part of the marking operation. In some implementations a text description of the ground type may be entered and stored as part of the electronic record. In another exemplary implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a ground type selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of ground types displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of ground type categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Pavement 2 Grass 3 Rough Rocky 4 Dirt 5 Gravel Sand More generally any number and variety of ground type categories may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example. In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that a ground type category may be accomplished via voice activated commands by simply speaking into the microphone.

Similarly with respect to service related information a user technician may manually enter some aspects of this information via the user interface display while other aspects may already be available in other memory locations e.g. the marking device ID or serial number a technician ID to which the marking device is assigned or checked out etc. and or may be received electronically.

While block is illustrated as one element of the process it should be appreciated that respective pieces of information received as input in block may be received at different times and via different interfaces sources and thus may occur at different points in the process . It should also be appreciated that block is an optional step in the process and that more generally a process for collecting marking information to generate an electronic record need not necessarily include collection of one or both of ticket information and service related information.

In block the locate technician utilizes the user interface to indicate the initiation of a marking operation. For example the technician may press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to commence a marking operation. In response a job initiation signal is provided to the processor e.g. via a switch closure and a ground or DC level applied to an I O pin of the processor or by the user interface providing a signal to the processor to initiate generation of an electronic record. Alternatively a remote job initiation signal may be received by the processor via the communication interface from another device such as the remote computer .

In response to the job initiation signal in block the processor opens a file in the memory in which to store the electronic record and assigns a file identifier to the opened file. In one example the file identifier assigned to the opened file may be or include one or more of a job number job ID or ticket number derived from the ticket information and or the service related information an identifier for the marking device itself and an identifier for a remote computer associated with the marking device e.g. for either remote control operation of the device and or data uploading downloading . To this end if ticket information and or service related information is not previously available e.g. if no information is received in block the technician optionally may be prompted to manually enter e.g. via a wizard or sequence of dialogues germane to obtaining relevant information displayed on the display of the user interface various elements of ticket information and or service related information from which a file identifier may be derived or provide other information that may be used as a file identifier.

A file opened in block for purposes of storing an electronic record may have any of a variety of formats and include any of a variety of data structures. In one embodiment the processor initially opens up a flat file for collection and logging of marking information to facilitate generation of an electronic record. As known in the art a flat file is a plain text or mixed text binary file containing one entry data record per line in which each entry may have multiple fields containing respective values and wherein the respective values may be separated by delimiters e.g. commas or have a fixed length. In one exemplary implementation the processor logs data into a flat file opened for the electronic record as a succession of time stamped event entries. Some event entries may be related specifically to actuation and or logged in response to actuation of the marking device e.g. the processor receiving an actuation signal . Other event entries may be more generally related in some manner to overall operation of the marking device or the marking operation itself but not necessarily associated with one or more particular actuations e.g. start pause stop marking operation power battery status communication link network connection status etc. and these other event entries may be logged at virtually any time in some cases irrespective of one or more actuations .

Accordingly it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this embodiment a flat file for an electronic record may contain a succession of time stamped event entries on respective lines in which one or more event entries may have multiple delimited fields values and at least some of the event entries relate to actuation of the marking device. In another aspect one or more fields values in a given event entry may specifically indicate in some manner whether or not the event is associated with an actuation of the marking device. In general an actuation event entry constitutes an entry in a file for an electronic record that is in some manner specifically related to and or logged in response to or during actuation of the marking device and multiple actuation event entries for a given actuation constitute an actuation data set for that actuation. Again it should be appreciated that a file for an electronic record may include one or more other event entries that may not be particularly associated with an actuation.

In other embodiments the file for an electronic record may or may not be a flat file and event entries associated with actuations actuation event entries may be somehow identified and differentiated from other event entries that are not associated with an actuation. For example a file for an electronic record may include a particular data structure or format that segregates or separates in some manner event entries associated with successive actuations from those event entries that are not particularly associated with actuations and or may be common to multiple actuations or a group of actuations . In yet other embodiments as discussed below marking information may be initially collected and logged in a first file for an electronic record in a first format e.g. a flat file including a succession of time stamped event entries as raw data for the marking operation that may be stored and or transmitted for any of a variety of purposes and then reformatted and or reorganized in some manner in one or more subsequent files e.g. a file having a particular data structure that segregates separates actuation related information from other information in different fields elements of a data structure for archiving and or transmission to one or more other devices processors.

Once a file for an electronic record is opened in block in block the processor can begin collecting and logging various marking information i.e. logging in the electronic record and or transmitting via the communication interface actuation event entries and or other event entries. In one exemplary implementation the processor may be programmed so as to poll one or more input devices and or other components of the marking device to receive information either once or multiple times periodically following the job initiation signal and log responses to these polls polling events as event entries with associated time stamps. Examples of entries corresponding to polling events that may be logged into the file for the electronic record and or transmitted include but are not limited to one or more power status event entries including power information associated with the power source one or more ticket information event entries including ticket information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. one or more service related information event entries including the service related information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. and one or more communication interface event entries including status information regarding operation of the communication interface e.g. network communication available unavailable .

Additionally or alternatively the processor may be programmed so as to respond to one or more signals designated as interrupt events from one or more components of the marking device. Such interrupt events cause logging of information in the electronic record and or transmission of information upon following the processor detecting the corresponding signal s . For example the job initiation signal itself may constitute an interrupt event in response to which the processor not only opens a file for the electronic record but once the file is opened the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into the electronic record a start job event entry including a job initiation time stamp associated with receipt of the job initiation signal.

In a similar manner following commencement of a marking operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to pause restart and or indicate completion of the marking operation and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of a pause signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a pause job event entry including a pause job time stamp associated with the at least one pause signal. When the technician is ready to continue as shown in block of the technician may indicate this via the user interface and a restart job event entry similarly may be logged. When the marking operation is deemed by the technician to be completed as noted in block of the technician may utilize the user interface so as to provide a stop signal to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a stop job event entry including a stop job time stamp associated with the stop signal.

Additionally the locate technician may utilize the user interface to denote the beginning and end of a marking operation for a particular facility type and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example upon beginning a marking operation for a given facility type the technician may select line start from the user interface and a corresponding line start signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line start event entry. Similarly when the technician wishes to indicate completion of the marking operation for a given facility type the technician may select line stop from the user interface and a corresponding line stop signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line stop even entry. 

While various events are noted above as examples of polling events as opposed to interrupt events it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited in these respects and that the marking data algorithm executed by the processor may be configured in any of a variety manners to designate various functions performed by and or information provided by various components of the marking device as polling events or interrupt events. For example the power source may be configured to provide a low battery signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that may be logged by the processor and or that may cause the processor to take some particular action e.g. provide an audible visible alert disable logging of further data etc. . In one aspect absent the low battery signal the processor may request status information from the power source once or occasionally as a polling event. Similarly the communication interface may be configured to provide a no network connection available signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that is logged and or causes the processor to take some action and when not present the processor may poll the communication interface to request status information as a polling event.

Another example of an interrupt event is given by the actuation signal provided by the actuation system upon actuation of the actuator i.e. a signal change of state indicating a transition from a non actuated state to an actuated state in response to which the processor logs one or more actuation event entries in the electronic record. More specifically in one implementation the receipt of a non actuated to actuated transition state of the actuation signal by the processor may cause an initial actuation event entry to be logged as a start actuation event entry having an associated time stamp i.e. a start time for the corresponding actuation and also cause the processor to subsequently poll one or more input devices for information during the corresponding actuation and until release of the actuator i.e. subsequent change of state of the actuation signal . In this manner an actuation data set for a given actuation may include multiple actuation event entries.

For example during actuation of the actuator the processor may poll the location tracking system so as to receive geographic information and in turn log one or more geo location data event entries in the actuation data set for the corresponding actuation. As discussed above in connection with in one exemplary implementation the location tracking system is configured to provide geographic information at an information update rate of approximately 5 Hz and the processor may log respective updates of geographic information provided by the location tracking system at this update rate during an actuation as multiple geo location data event entries of the actuation data set. It should be appreciated however that methods and apparatus according to various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect and that other geographic information update rates may be employed in various implementations e.g. update rates of up to approximately 100 Hz based in part on the particular location tracking system employed. Furthermore it should be appreciated that in some implementations the geographic information provided by the location tracking system may include one or more longitude coordinates latitude coordinates and a corresponding geo location data time stamp at which a given set of longitude latitude coordinates are obtained by the location tracking system accordingly a given geo location data event entry in an actuation data set may include a longitude coordinate a latitude coordinate and the corresponding geo location data time stamp.

Similarly in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the timing system and the marking material detection mechanism so as to receive timing information and or marking material information during a corresponding actuation and in turn log one or more of a timing event entry and a marking material detection event entry as part of the actuation data set. Any of a variety of marking material information as discussed above may be collected and logged during actuation in response to processor polling of the marking material detection mechanism e.g. causing an RFID tag reader to read various information from an RFID tag affixed to the marking dispenser .

Additionally in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the user interface the communication interface and the local memory to retrieve ticket information and or service related information for logging into an actuation data set. As discussed above in some implementations the receipt retrieval of ticket information and or service related information may be treated as a polling event not necessarily associated with actuations and this information need not be included in one or more actuation data sets. However in other implementations it may be desirable to include at least some aspect of ticket information and or service related information in each actuation data set notwithstanding the possible redundancy of data content in respective actuation data sets e.g. see Table 6 discussed further below in connection with .

Another example of an interrupt event is given by a change of state of the actuation signal indicating a transition from the actuated state to the non actuated state i.e. release of the actuator . In response to this event the processor may request information from the timing system and log an end actuation event entry including an end time stamp.

Yet another type of interrupt event causing the processor to log one or more event entries may be provided by the marking material detection mechanism in the form of a signal that indicates whether or not a marking dispenser is contained in or appropriately coupled to the marking device. To this end as discussed above in connection with the marking material detection mechanism may include a toggle switch that provides a two state signal to the processor e.g. dispenser in dispenser out as an interrupt. Upon receiving an interrupt indicating a transition from dispenser out to dispenser in the processor may collect and log this event as a dispenser in event entry with a corresponding time stamp and then request other marking material information relating to the marking material in the dispenser from the marking material detection mechanism. In view of the foregoing it should be appreciated that in some embodiments marking material information may not necessarily be collected during one or more actuations of the marking device but alternatively may be collected only upon a dispenser in event being detected. Upon detection of an interrupt event indicating a transition from dispenser in to dispenser out the processor similarly may collect and log this event as a dispenser out event entry. 

In yet another embodiment the processor executing marking data algorithm may be configured to repeatedly regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the marking device e.g. in a predetermined order in response to receipt of the job initiation signal and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including marking information received pursuant to these polling events. In one aspect of this embodiment each data packet of marking information may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. For example in one implementation the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID e.g. ticket identifier technician ID device ID e.g. serial number packet type ID and or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device s or components and one or more flag fields that are set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator marking dispenser in marking dispenser out low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Table 1 below illustrates an example of a portion of the contents of a relatively simple flat file for an electronic record that may be generated by the process of 

As noted above it should be appreciated that the portion of the file shown in Table 1 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that the format and or content for respective event entries and the file itself for an electronic record generated by and or based on the information collection process discussed above in connection with may have any of a variety of different formats and or content.

To this point Tables 2 through 5 below provide examples of various events for which event entries may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device exemplary formats for these event entries and exemplary file formats for files having multiple such entries according to another embodiment of the present invention.

Job Started Paused Restarted Completed Events This event entry format provides information about when a marking operation job was started and completed in addition to capturing details about if and when the job was paused and restarted.

Actuation State Change Events For purposes of this event format the actuator is deemed to have three possible states i.e. PRESSED HELD and RELEASED. Marking information from one or more input devices other components of the marking device is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

Marking Device Status Events The status event collects various marking information and or information on operating characteristics of the device on a periodic basis while a job is in progress e.g. pursuant to processor polls .

Error Events Should any input device or other component of the marking device encounter a significant error condition this may be logged as an event. In some cases the user technician also may be notified of the error through the user interface visible alert on display audible alarm alert etc. . Similar event formats may be adopted for warning alerts events and informational alerts events.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including the event entries outlined above in Tables 2 through 5 two exemplary file formats namely ASCII and XML are provided below for purposes of illustration. In various implementations a given marking device may be particularly configured to store and or transmit electronic records and respective entries therein in either format or other formats . With respect to identification of files electronic records a standard naming scheme format may be adopted for example including an identifier for the remote computer with which the marking device may be communicating ServerID an identifier for the marking device itself WandID and an identifier for the marking operation job JobID and having the format ServerID WandID Job ID. 

ASCII Data Format This format allows low level remote processing engines to quickly and easily receive parse and react to marking information logged and or transmitted by the marking device. An example of an electronic record formatted in ASCII based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

XML Data Format This format allows transmission of self describing data elements from the marking device in some instances reducing processing errors and reducing the risks and effort involved in upgrades and data changes. An example of an electronic record formatted in XML based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

Yet another alternative format for storing and organizing marking information in an electronic record of a marking operation according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in Table 6 below. By way of example Table 6 shows the format and content of three actuation data sets of an electronic record of a marking operation for a given facility in which each actuation data set includes information associated with multiple actuation event entries logged during a corresponding actuation and resulting locate mark e.g. act act and act as shown for example in . As discussed above it should be appreciated that the format and content shown below in Table 6 may constitute an original electronic record generated by the processor pursuant to the process shown in or may be derived from raw data collected and logged pursuant to the process e.g. as a flat file an ASCII formatted file or an XML formatted file and subsequently reorganized and particularly formatted.

In addition to the information shown in Table 6 a job ID or some other identifier for the electronic record as a whole e.g. a ticket number as well as a total number of actuations for a given marking operation e.g. the total number of actuation data sets in a given electronic record in this embodiment may be included in the electronic record.

With regard to color information that may be included in any of the event entries and electronic records discussed herein Table 7 below shows an example of the correlation of marking material color to the type of facility to be marked.

The data structure of the actuation data set C of the electronic record shown in includes a start location field corresponding to T1 geo location data shown in Table 2 an end location field corresponding to T2 geo location data shown in Table 2 a start time field corresponding to T1 timestamp data shown in Table 2 an end time field corresponding to T2 timestamp data shown in Table 2 and a duration field corresponding to the duration t shown in Table 2 . Additionally the data structure for entry C includes one or more fields A B . . . N for intermediate location data corresponding to 1interval location data 2interval location data . . . Nth interval location data shown in Table 2 . Finally the data structure for the entry C may include one or more ticket information fields e.g. corresponding to Locate request data in Table 2 and one or more service related information fields e.g. corresponding to Service provider ID User ID and Device ID in Table 2 .

In addition to one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations of a marking device the electronic record shown in may include one or more additional elements. For example shows an additional element of the electronic record to store the total number of entries in the record. Furthermore according to another embodiment various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves. For example in one alternative implementation one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the marking material properties field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are not included within any one actuation data set e.g. the information contained in one or more of the ticket information field and the service related information field may be common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

In yet another embodiment of the present invention the marking device shown in may be configured e.g. via particular instructions included in the marking data algorithm executing on the processor and or various hardware modifications to operate in multiple different modes so as to collect various information relating not only to a marking operation itself marking information but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig area in which the marking operation is performed. For example in one implementation the marking device may be configured to operate in a first marking mode which essentially follows various aspects of the process outlined in and also operate in a second landmark identification mode or more simply landmark mode in which the marking device acquires information relating to one or more environmental landmarks that may be germane to the marking operation e.g. in and around the work site dig area and or generally in the vicinity of the marking operation .

More specifically in a marking mode marking material may be dispensed with respective actuations of the marking device and various information transmitted and or stored in an electronic record attendant to this process as discussed above. Alternatively in a landmark mode marking material is not necessarily dispensed with an actuation of the marking device and in some instances the dispensing of marking material is specifically precluded instead a technician positions the marking device proximate to an environmental landmark of interest and upon actuation the marking device collects various information about the landmark hereafter referred to as landmark information which information may include but is not limited to geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark and a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark.

More specifically as shown in in this embodiment the marking device further includes a mode selector device in the form of a bypass device that is operated so as to impact and deflect the mechanical coupler of the actuation system such that the mechanical coupler fails to cause the dispensing of a marking material upon actuation of the actuator . In the bypass device is shown in a first state e.g. released which allows the marking device to operate in marking mode as described above i.e. the mechanical coupler is allowed to be displaced essentially vertically with actuation of the actuator and thereby dispense markers . In the bypass device is shown in a second state e.g. depressed which allows the marking device to operate in landmark mode in particular the mechanical coupler is deflected by the bypass device such that upon actuation of the actuator the mechanical coupler is not displaced vertically. In one example with reference again to when the mechanical coupler is deflected by the bypass device actuations of the actuator do not effect full essentially up down vertical movement of the mechanical coupler as a result the mechanical coupler fails to displace the actuation mechanism and no pressure is applied to the spray nozzle of a paint dispenser or dispensing mechanism of other types of marker dispensers . At the same time however actuation of the actuator nonetheless provides an actuation signal to the processor which may provide for logging of an actuation event entry as discussed above .

In various implementations the bypass device may be a locking and or spring loaded switching device e.g. a press release locking thumb switch appropriately positioned along the housing of the marking device e.g. near or on the handle wherein the bypass device provides for both deflection of the mechanical coupler as well as opening closure of electrical contacts so as to provide a mode signal to the processor . For example as shown in the first state released of the bypass device may include an open contact state and no deflection of the mechanical coupler whereas the second state shown in depressed may include a closed contact state e.g. in which the mode signal is provided to the processor as an interrupt event to indicate landmark mode when the bypass device deflects the mechanical coupler .

In response to the mode signal indicating landmark mode the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into an electronic record a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the marking data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode such as providing for the selection of landmark categories and or types via the user interface and menus provided on the display and logging actuation event entries in an electronic record as landmark event entries. Further details of landmark mode operation of the marking device are discussed below in connection with .

In another exemplary implementation rather than employing the bypass device shown in as a mode selector device a marking device configured to implement a landmark mode in which no marker or marking material is dispensed may be modified to include an actuator locking device as a mode selector device to prevent operation of the actuator . In essence such a device would function in a manner similar to a trigger lock. Like the bypass device the actuator locking device or trigger lock may not only mechanically impede operation of the actuator but also include electrical switch contacts opened closed so as to provide a mode signal to the processor to indicate a landmark mode when the actuator locking device is engaged to impede actuation. Because such an actuator locking device impedes operation of the actuator the actuator itself cannot be employed to provide an actuation signal to the processor to facilitate the logging into an electronic record of actuation event entries as landmark event entries. Accordingly in implementations involving an actuator locking device another aspect of the user interface e.g. a button switch portion of the touch screen display microphone to provide for voice activation etc. is employed to provide a signal to the processor to facilitate logging of an event e.g. a landmark event by the technician. Further details of logging of landmark events are discussed below in connection with .

Yet another exemplary implementation of a marking device modified to operate in landmark mode is based on the general implementation of an actuation system shown in in which the landmark mode is selected via the user interface and or display e.g. menu driven GUI rather than via a bypass device or actuator locking device i.e. some functionality of the user interface itself provides for a mode selector device. With reference again to dispensing of marking material in this implementation is controlled by a link transmitter . As discussed above in connection with the link transmitter may be responsive to the actuation signal provided by sensor with operation of the actuator for example or alternatively responsive to a signal provided by the processor such that dispensing of marking material may in part be under the control of the processor executing particular instructions for this purpose . Accordingly in this implementation when a landmark mode is selected via the user interface the marking device may be configured to either dispense marking material by not impeding any control signals to the link transmitter e.g. so as to form one or more landmark locate marks on or near a target environmental landmark or not to dispense marking material by impeding control signals to the link transmitter or otherwise controlling the link transmitter to not dispense marking material . In either case the actuation signal output by sensor may nonetheless be provided to the processor so as to facilitate logging of an actuation event entry upon actuation of the actuator which in landmark mode may be designated as a landmark event entry as discussed further below in connection with .

In the process outlined in following commencement of a marking operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface speak into a microphone to provide a voice activated command etc. to not only pause restart and or indicate completion of the marking operation but further to select a landmark mode of operation for the marking device. As noted above in the discussion of any one or more of these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of if a technician selects landmark mode via the user interface the user interface may provide a landmark mode signal to the processor. In response to this signal the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the marking data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode as discussed above the landmark mode may be entered in alternative implementations via a mode signal provided to the processor by a bypass device or an actuator locking device serving as a mode selector device .

Table 8 below provides an example of content and format for a mode select event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device. The example mode select event entry shown below in Table 8 follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the process outlined in subsequent to selection of the landmark mode as noted in block the process may provide for the selection of a particular category and or type of landmark for which information is to be collected. To this end in one implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a landmark selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of landmarks displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of landmark categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Natural Gas 2 Water Sewer 3 Power Line 4 Phone Line 5 CATV Line and 6 Other. 

Upon selection via the user interface of one of the landmark categories displayed on the submenu the processor may control the user interface so as to display yet another submenu indicating various types of landmarks that fall within the selected category so as to facilitate selection of a particular type of landmark for which information is to be collected. Examples of types of landmarks that may be displayed and available for selection via the user interface for each of the above identified categories include but are not limited to 

While the foregoing discussion of landmark categories and types provides one construct in which a wide variety of landmarks are made available for selection by the technician it should be appreciated that in other implementations options for landmark selection may be presented in different manners. For example a more succinct list of landmark types may be presented to the technician to facilitate easy selection e.g. a more limited set of about a dozen more common landmark types that might be encountered in the field such as telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. . More generally any number and variety of landmark types may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example.

In another exemplary implementation the categories and or types of landmarks made available for selection via the user interface may be based at least in part on a type of facility being marked when the marking device was in a marking mode prior to selection of the landmark mode. For example consider a technician using the marking device in the marking mode and in the process of marking a power line. In one implementation upon switching to landmark mode the user is first presented with selection options for landmark category and or type that are more closely related to a power line e.g. a more limited subset of option types including pole transformer pedestal etc. . In one aspect the technician may nonetheless still have the option to select other categories and or types of landmarks but as a default the technician is first presented with options related to the type of facility last being marked. In another aspect the selection options for landmark category and or type may be specifically and intentionally limited to those options that are most germane to the type of facility last being marked in the previous marking mode i.e. immediately prior to entry into the landmark mode .

In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that landmark category and or type selection may be accomplished via voice activated commands. For example once landmark mode is selected the technician may select a particular landmark category or type by simply speaking into the microphone e.g. telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. .

In addition to or as an alternative to selection of landmark category and or type block may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion as part of the landmark information in an electronic record. For example in some exemplary implementations via the user interface and or display the technician may enter text based information relating to an environmental landmark e.g. as an offset to another topological architectural or infrastructure feature in proximity to the environmental landmark telephone pole 5 ft. from back of curb . Additionally in a manner similar to landmark type selection the user interface display may provide for menu driven selection via a GUI of predetermined options for additional text based information to be included as part of the landmark information e.g. a set of stock text messages for selection to be included as part of landmark information .

Following selection of landmark category and or type and or entry section of any text based information in block of the process shown in in block actuations of the actuator in landmark mode cause the processor to collect various landmark information with each actuation which information is logged in an electronic record as a landmark event entry rather than an actuation event entry as noted in Table 3 above . Furthermore as noted above the processor and or the link transmitter of the actuation system may be particularly configured to either dispense or not dispense marking material upon actuations in landmark mode. Essentially in landmark mode the technician positions the marking device proximate to a selected category type of landmark and actuates the actuator to acquire various information relating to the landmark e.g. geo location data type time stamp .

In general the processor may be configured to communicate with e.g. poll any of a variety of input devices to collect landmark information to be logged in an electronic record. As discussed above in connection with the marking mode refer again to FIG. 2 such information may be acquired from any of a variety of input devices including but not limited to the location tracking system the timing system the communications interface e.g. a USB port or other port the user interface and the local memory .

In particular any data that is available from the location tracking system e.g. any information available in various NMEA data messages such as coordinated universal time date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values dilution of precision values may be collected as landmark information and logged in an electronic record as part of a landmark event entry. Additionally information collected from the user interface in the form of a text entry by the technician may be included in a landmark event entry for example in one implementation upon actuation of the actuator the processor may prompt the technician via the display of the user interface to enter text notes if desired e.g. the technician may describe an offset of a target environmental landmark from an architectural topographical or infrastructure feature to compliment geographic information provided by the location tracking system and this textual information may serve as landmark information. In view of the foregoing it should be appreciated that landmark information may include a wide variety of information components including but not limited to one or more of geographical information e.g. from the location tracking system timing information e.g. from the location tracking system and or the timing system landmark category and or type information e.g. selected or entered via the user interface textual information e.g. entered via the user interface or other information e.g. received from the local memory and or the communications interface .

Table 9 below provides an example of content and format for a landmark event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device when in landmark mode. The example landmark event entry shown below in Table 9 also follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the example landmark event entry given in Table 9 the landmark information includes a time stamp e.g. DATE and TIME geographical information e.g. GPS data category type information and text based information for an environmental landmark. The notation LMRK 3 12 in the example denotes a category 3 type 12 landmark which in the exemplary listings provided above corresponds to Power Line Circuit Breaker. It should be appreciated that the event entry shown in Table 9 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that a variety of other or additional landmark information may be included in landmark event entries as noted above.

As with the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above the exemplary format for a mode select and landmark event entry as shown in Tables 8 and 9 may be included in either an ASCII and XML file format for an electronic record that is stored and or transmitted by the marking device in which a particular naming scheme format may be adopted to identify files electronic records such as ServerID WandID Job ID . It should also be appreciated that an electronic record generated by a multi mode marking device in some instances may include a mixture of actuation event entries and landmark event entries actuation event entries without any landmark event entries and landmark event entries without any actuation event entries.

Yet another alternative format for storing and organizing landmark information in an electronic record according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in Tables 10 and 11 below. By way of example Table 10 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a utility pole which includes one geo location data point and Table 11 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a pedestal which includes four geo location data points i.e. one for each corner of the pedestal . It should be appreciated that the format and content shown below in Tables 10 and 11 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and as noted above a variety of format and content may be included in an electronic record entry for landmark information. The examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 may constitute an original electronic record generated by the processor pursuant to the process shown in or may be derived from raw data collected and logged pursuant to the process e.g. as a flat file an ASCII formatted file or an XML formatted file and subsequently reorganized and particularly formatted. It should also be appreciated that the examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 illustrate that landmark information may be included in an electronic record together with one or both of ticket information and service related information as discussed above in connection with electronic records including various marking information.

In other respects the data structure in is similar to that shown in . For example various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves e.g. one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the marking material properties field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

Once an actuation of the marking device in landmark mode has been logged as a landmark event entry the process shown in returns to block . At this point the technician is provided via the user interface display with the options of pausing the job block restarting the job if previously paused block stopping the job and indicating completion block or selecting landmark mode again block for the next actuation. If the technician selects none of these options the process returns to block at which point further polling and or interrupt events are logged i.e. an actuation event entry capturing marking information is logged with the next actuation of the actuator as discussed above in connection with . Accordingly after an actuation in landmark mode in one exemplary implementation the marking device defaults back to the marking mode unless and until the technician selects the landmark mode again for a subsequent actuation.

In an alternative implementation not shown in following actuation of the marking device in landmark mode the processor may control the user interface display to provide an option to the technician to exit landmark mode rather than automatically presenting the options of pause job restart job stop job or landmark mode . In this manner the marking device remains in landmark mode for subsequent actuations until the technician makes a menu selection to exit landmark mode at which point the process returns to block .

In yet another embodiment the processor executing marking data algorithm in landmark mode may be configured to generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets representing various event entries logged by the marking device e.g. as shown above in Tables 2 9 . As discussed above in connection with the marking mode each data packet may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. To accommodate both a marking mode and a landmark mode one flag field may be set or reset upon selection of the landmark mode so as to identify the contents of any information payload field in the data packet as landmark information as opposed to marking information. Similarly as discussed above one or more other flag fields may be set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator marking dispenser in marking dispenser out low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag and certain data packets also may be tagged as generated in marking mode or landmark mode. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Thus in landmark identification mode a locate technician may employ an appropriately configured marking device to capture the types and locations of environmental landmarks of interest that are present at the work site and or in the general environs of a dig area. While in landmark mode the locate technician may approach a certain environmental landmark then select the type of the environmental landmark via user interface position the marking device e.g. place the tip of marking device proximate to the target environmental landmark and then actuate the marking device. In doing so the marking device logs in an electronic record landmark information including for example the type of the target environmental landmark the geo location of the target environmental landmark and a time stamp in an electronic record. The locate technician may move from one environmental landmark to the next until information about all environmental landmarks of interest has been captured. Additionally one or more data points e.g. landmark event entries may be captured for any given environmental landmark.

VI. Computer generated Visual Representation of a Marking Operation Including Marking Information and Landmark Information

With reference again to in yet another embodiment the processor executing marking data algorithm and or one or more remote computers executing marking data algorithm may additionally process various marking information and or landmark information provided in real time from a marking device and or stored in an electronic record of a marking operation and control a display device e.g. display of marking device or some other display device to render a computer generated visual representation of one or both of the marking information and landmark information. Such a visual representation may be used for example to provide immediate feedback to the locate technician provide essentially real time feedback to a supervisor monitoring the technician from a remote location provide a visual record of the marking information and or the landmark information e.g. for archiving purposes once one or more electronic records are generated and or to verify the quality e.g. accuracy and completeness of work performed during a locate and marking operation. For purposes of the following discussion a marking operation may refer to one or both of the processes of collecting marking information and landmark information. Accordingly it should be appreciated that in various exemplary implementations of a computer generated visual representation only marking information may be visually rendered only landmark information may be visually rendered or both marking information and landmark information may be visually rendered.

In various aspects of this embodiment a visual representation may be static in that all available marking information and or landmark information is presented in a display field at one time after generation of an electronic record alternatively the visual representation may be dynamic in that marking information and or landmark information is displayed in essentially real time as it is collected or may be displayed after generation of the electronic record in a time sequenced animation that recreates the collection of information on the time scale in which it was originally acquired e.g. based on the time stamps indicating when the information was acquired .

In other aspects the relative positions of all locate marks represented by actuation event entries logged and or transmitted by the marking device as well as the relative positions of all environmental landmarks represented by landmark event entries logged and or transmitted by the marking device may be displayed e.g. based on geo location data and some appropriate scale of an available display field of display to provide a visual representation of the marking operation. A visual representation of a marking operation may also be rendered in one or more particular colors corresponding to one or more particular underground facilities marked during the marking operation e.g. see Table 7 .

In one exemplary implementation such a visual representation may include one electronic locate mark displayed in a display field for each actuation dispensing action of a marking device such that there is essentially a one to one correspondence between electronic locate marks and physical locate marks for a given underground facility marked during a marking operation. Alternatively in another exemplary implementation of such a visual representation an essentially continuous solid line or other line type may be displayed in a display field to represent a given underground facility marked during a marking operation. In another aspect the processor may process the geo location data in respective marking actuation data sets of an electronic record so as to filter average interpolate and or otherwise smooth data e.g. so as to provide cleaner visual renderings and or connect successive locate marks represented by the respective actuation data sets of the electronic record alternatively raw data provided by the marking device may be utilized for the visual representation. In yet another aspect of this embodiment visual representations of multiple marking operations for different underground facilities within the same work site dig area may be generated in the same display field of a display device so as to provide a composite visual representation in which different underground facilities may be uniquely identified in some manner e.g. by different line types and or different colors and one or more environmental landmarks in and or around the work site dig area may be identified using a variety of displayed identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. .

In block of the process if an electronic record has already been generated for the marking operation in which one or more underground facilities are marked and or environmental landmark information is acquired the record is examined to determine the geographic extents of the locate marks and or environmental landmarks to be visually rendered on a display device. In particular the processor may review the geo location data of all actuation data sets of the electronic record to determine e.g. based on the respective latitude and longitude coordinates of the available geo location data the maximum extents of the marking operation to be visually rendered.

The maximum extents of the marking operation may be determined in any of a variety of manners according to different exemplary implementations. For example in one exemplary implementation in block the processor may determine the centroid of all electronic locate marks and or environmental landmarks represented by respective actuation data sets of the electronic record to be displayed. The processor then determines the geographic extent of the collection of electronic locate marks and or environmental landmarks by determining one or more latitude longitude coordinate pairs from the available data having a greatest distance from the centroid. In one example the processor may determine a single farthest point from the centroid and a distance between this farthest point and the centroid serves as a radius of a circle that provides an extents area circle. In another example the farthest opposing corners of a rectangle around the centroid may be determined by assigning the centroid as the origin of a reference coordinate system and finding the coordinate pairs in opposing quadrants of the coordinate system having a greatest distance from the centroid e.g. the LAT LONG and LAT LONG coordinate pairs at a greatest distance from the origin to provide an extents area rectangle. Other types of polygons and closed shapes ovals may be employed to provide an extents area for the marking operation to be displayed.

Alternatively if an electronic record has not been previously generated and information received in essentially real time from the marking device is to be displayed in a display field a default extents area may be selected in advance based on any of a variety of criteria. For example address and or site description information provided in a ticket pursuant to which the marking operation is performed may provide a basis on which an extents area for the marking operation may be estimated a priori. Similarly as discussed further below in connection with an available digital image of the work site dig area may be employed to determine or estimate an initial extents area for the marking operation.

In block the extents area of the marking operation to be visually rendered is then mapped to an available display field of a display device using any appropriate scaling factor as necessary to ensure that all of the geo location data in the electronic record fits within the display field. For example in one exemplary implementation a transformation may be derived using information relating to the available display field e.g. a reference coordinate system using an appropriate scale for a given display field of a display device to map data points within the extents area to the available display field. In another aspect of this example a buffer area around the extents area may be added to provide one or more suitable margins for the displayed visual representation and or to accommodate different shapes of extents areas to the available display field of the display device and an appropriate transformation may be derived based on this optional additional buffer area.

Once a transformation is derived to map the marking operation extents area to the available display field of a display device in block one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. for environmental landmarks is are rendered in the display field based on applying the transformation to the geo location data present in the data set of one or more corresponding actuation data sets of the electronic record. In one exemplary implementation one electronic locate mark is rendered in the display field for each actuation data set of an electronic record. With reference again to Table 6 and in one embodiment each actuation data set includes at least T1 geo location data for a start of an actuation of a marking device and one or more other pieces of geo location data during actuation. Using multiple pieces of geo location data per actuation data set an electronic locate mark may be rendered as a line in the display field e.g. so as to visually represent one of the physical locate marks or shown in FIG. 8 . In another exemplary implementation an electronic locate mark may be rendered for each geo location data in a given entry such that multiple electronic locate marks correspond to one actuation e.g. a series of dots electronically rendered to graphically represent a line type physical locate mark . In one aspect as discussed above a given electronic locate mark may be rendered in a particular color and or line type to represent a type of underground facility represented by the mark e.g. as indicated by marking material information included in the electronic record .

As noted above while in one embodiment there may be a one to one correspondence between electronic locate marks rendered in a single or composite visual representation and physical locate marks placed in a dig area during a marking operation or there may be multiple electronic locate marks for a corresponding physical locate mark in yet other embodiments a single or composite visual representation may provide a variety of other indicators digital representations of marked underground facilities in a computer generated visual rendering. For example illustrates another example of a composite visual representation based on the same electronic record used to generate the composite visual representation of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective marking operations. To this end in one exemplary implementation an additional step may be included in the process shown in in which the processor may process the marking geo location data in an electronic record by filtering averaging interpolating and or otherwise smoothing the data so as to connect successive discrete locate marks represented by the respective actuation data sets of the electronic record and thereby provide a substantially smooth continuous line for display.

Similarly filtering averaging interpolating processing and or otherwise smoothing of data may be applied to landmark information captured in landmark event entries. For example multiple event entries logged for a particular environmental landmark e.g. the four corners of a pedestal may be processed so as to provide a single point in a display field at which to display a symbol icon or other identifier for an environmental landmark. Such processing may include for example selecting any one of multiple geo location coordinates captured in multiple event entries as representative of the landmark location calculating a centroid of all points represented by captured coordinates pre filtering a collection of coordinates to eliminate significant outliers and subsequently determining a centroid of the remaining coordinates etc.

In the example of as also noted above different underground facility types may be indicated in different color lines and the different colors facility types may be derived from the electronic record e.g. based on the correlations provided in Table 7 . Furthermore in other aspects text indicators may be included in the visual representation and or other types of coding may be used different line styles such as patterns width bold etc. a succession of symbols or other graphic icons etc. to indicate different facility types and or some other aspect of a given facility e.g. the material used for a particular pipe conduit cable sheathing the diameter of a particular pipe conduit cable offsets to one or more environmental landmarks etc. . By way of example indicates that the four underground facilities in the composite visual representation correspond to a power line which may be rendered in the color red a first sewer line which may be rendered in the color green a second sewer line which also may be rendered in the color green and a telecommunications line which may be rendered in the color orange . An exemplary composite visual representation may include additional textual numeric and or graphic elements to provide other information available in the electronic record for the marking operations e.g. timestamp information ID information coordinates for location information offset indications etc. . For example in an offset of 3 feet is indicated between the fire hydrant and the sewer line .

In some marking operations a technician may use the marking device not only to mark an underground facility s placement path relative to the ground pavement or other surface but also to annotate the marking operation in some fashion. For example in some instances a technician actually writes with the marking device e.g. by actuating the marking device to dispense paint to provide text annotations offset indications arrows other symbols and the like on the ground pavement or other surface. Accordingly the electronic record for a marking operation may include one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations in which the technician was writing to annotate the marking operation in some fashion rather than marking the path of an underground facility. In some cases providing such technician annotations on a visual representation of a marking operation may be desirable however in other instances such annotations may provide erratic markings on a visual representation in which case additional processing of geo location data or other information in the electronic record e.g. filtering averaging interpolating and or otherwise smoothing the data may be employed.

In yet another embodiment a single or composite visual representation of a marking operation including one or both of marking information and landmark information may be rendered on a display device together with a digital image representative of at least a portion of a dig area at a work site such that one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks appear in appropriate relative positions overlaid on the displayed digital image. illustrates yet another example of a composite visual representation albeit based on an electronic record different than that used to generate the visual representations of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective different underground facilities marked and these lines are overlaid on a digital image of a dig area together with identifiers for environmental landmarks. It should be appreciated that although continuous lines representing underground facilities are depicted on a digital image in in other embodiments discrete electronic locate marks corresponding to successive actuations of a marking device or multiple discrete electronic locate marks per actuation may be overlaid on a digital image of the dig area.

In the embodiment of a number of different image sources and image types may be employed to provide the digital image on which a visual representation of a marking operation may be overlaid. For purposes of the present disclosure such a digital image also referred to herein as an input image may be any image represented by source data that is electronically processed e.g. the source data is in a computer readable format to display the image on a display device. An input image may include any of a variety of paper tangible image sources that are scanned e.g. via an electronic scanner or otherwise converted so as to create source data e.g. in various formats such as XML PDF JPG BMP etc. that can be processed to display the input image. An input image also may include an image that originates as source data or an electronic file without necessarily having a corresponding paper tangible copy of the image e.g. an image of a real world scene acquired by a digital still frame or video camera or other image acquisition device in which the source data at least in part represents pixel information from the image acquisition device .

In some exemplary implementations input images according to the present disclosure may be created provided and or processed by a geographic information system GIS that captures stores analyzes manages and presents data referring to or linked to location such that the source data representing the input image includes pixel information from an image acquisition device corresponding to an acquired real world scene or representation thereof and or spatial geographic information geo encoded information .

In view of the foregoing various examples of input images and source data representing input images according to the present disclosure to which the inventive concepts disclosed herein may be applied include but are not limited to 

It should also be appreciated that source data representing an input image may be compiled from multiple data information sources for example any two or more of the examples provided above for input images and source data representing input images or any two or more other data sources can provide information that can be combined or integrated to form source data that is electronically processed to display an image on a display device.

As noted above in some implementations an input image may be indexed to Global Positioning System GPS coordinates or another coordinate system that provides geo spatial positioning. An input image may include geo coding or other geographical identification metadata and may be provided in any computer readable format. An input image may also include images of map symbols such as roads and street names that may be superimposed upon or displayed separately from an underlying geographic area when the input image is displayed on a display device.

Based on the foregoing a digital image may be displayed in an available display field of a display device either before or after electronic locate marks and or identifiers for environmental landmarks are displayed in the available display field. For example in one implementation after the block in all or a portion of the digital image may be mapped to the available display field based on any relevant geographic information accompanying the digital image e.g. GPS coordinates to which the image is indexed . Alternatively the digital image may be mapped first to the available display field of the display device depending on appropriate scaling and or transformation parameters as would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art and thereafter one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks similarly may be mapped to the available display field in appropriate positions relative to the underlying digital image. In the example of a first visual representation of a gas line is depicted a second visual representation of a communication line is depicted and a third visual representation of an electric line is depicted on an aerial image of a residential dig area for purposes of illustration. As discussed above in connection with other embodiments these visual representations may be displayed in different colors and or line types to denote different types of underground facilities and or various attributes of a given facility. As also illustrated in other types of markings may be included as part of the displayed image including various environmental landmarks such as junction boxes or transformers streets property boundaries tie downs reference lines between marked facilities and environmental landmarks and or property boundaries and their associated dimensions and one or more text boxes e.g. to indicate an address of the work site over the residence and the like.

In some implementations marking information and landmark information if displayed together may be differentiated in a display field in any of a variety of manners e.g. different line types symbols or patterns different colors or shades of related colors artificially offset from each other in the display field if marking information and landmark information overlap or are sufficiently close to each other in some instances etc. to allow for sufficient visual perception of both marking information and landmark information.

Additionally in one embodiment each of marking information and landmark information if present in a computer aided visual rendering as well as any constituent information forming part of the marking information and landmark information may be displayed as separate layers of the visual rendering such that a viewer of the visual rendering may turn on and turn off displayed information based on a categorization of the displayed information. shows a generic display device having a display field with exemplary content for purposes of explaining some concepts germane to display layers according to one embodiment. For example all marking information may be categorized generally under one layer designation marking layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly and all landmark information may be categorized generally under yet another layer designation landmark layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly. Respective layers may be enabled or disabled for display in any of a variety of manners for example in one implementation a layer directory or layer legend pane may be included in the display field or as a separate window selectable from the display field of the visual rendering showing all available layers and allowing a viewer to select each available layer to be either displayed or hidden thus facilitating comparative viewing of layers.

Furthermore any of the above mentioned general categories for layers may have sub categories for sub layers such that each sub layer may also be selectively enabled or disabled for viewing by a viewer. For example under the general layer designation of marking layer different facility types that may have been detected during a marking operation and indicated in the marking information by color for example may be categorized under different sub layer designations e.g. designation for marking layer electric designation for marking layer gas etc. in this manner a viewer may be able to hide only the electric marking information while viewing the gas marking information or vice versa in addition to having the option to view or hide all marking information. Sub layer designations similarly may be employed for the landmark information e.g. designation for landmark layer water sewer designation for landmark layer CATV designation for landmark layer buildings . As shown in the example of both the marking and landmark layers are enabled for display amongst the illustrated sub layer designations only the electric sub layer of the marking layer is enabled for display and only the buildings sub layer of the landmark layer is enabled for display. Accordingly using the exemplary composite visual representation shown in as a baseline for purposes of illustration only the power line appears in the electronic rendering A shown in as a constituent element of the electric sub layer of the marking layer together with the building .

Virtually any characteristic of the information available for display may serve to categorize the information for purposes of display layers or sub layers. In particular any of the various exemplary constituent elements of marking information discussed herein e.g. timing information geographic information service related information ticket information marking material information environmental information and operational information the latter two of which are discussed in greater detail further below may be categorized as a sub layer and one or more sub layers may further be categorized into constituent elements for selective display e.g. as sub sub layers . Similarly any of the various exemplary constituent elements of landmark information discussed herein e.g. geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark may be categorized as a sub layer and any sub layer may be further categorized into sub sub layers and so on .

It should further be appreciated that according to various embodiments the attributes and or type of visual information displayed as a result of selecting one or more layers or sub layers is not limited. In particular visual information corresponding to a selected layer or sub layer may be electronically rendered in the form of one or more lines or shapes of various colors shadings and or line types text graphics e.g. symbols or icons and or images for example. Likewise the visual information corresponding to a selected layer or sub layer may include multiple forms of visual information one or more of lines shapes text graphics and or images .

As a non limiting illustrative example a marking layer may include respective sub layers of different facility types marked in which respective facility types are rendered on the display as lines having different colors line types and or shading. A temperature sub layer of a marking layer may include ground temperatures sensed during marking of respective facility types in which sensed temperatures are rendered on the display as an icon symbol in combination with text e.g. a snowflake accompanied by a text label 15 deg. F in proximity to the visual rendering of the marked facility. From the foregoing it may be appreciated that a wide variety of information may be categorized in a nested hierarchy of layers and information included in the layers may be visually rendered when selected enabled for display in a variety of manners.

In addition to the marking information and or the landmark information in yet other embodiments in which a digital image is rendered in the display field e.g. as shown in the image information on which the digital image is based may be categorized as a display layer such that the marking information landmark information and image information may be selectively enabled or disabled for display as a display layer. In this manner the displayed digital image on which one or both of marking information and landmark information may be overlaid and in some instances constituent elements thereof may be toggled on and off conveniently for comparative display.

In one exemplary implementation all image information may be categorized generally under one layer designation e.g. Reference see designation in FIG. 18 and independently enabled or disabled for display e.g. hidden accordingly. Similarly while not shown in in some implementations all information available for overlay including both marking information and landmark information if available may be categorized generally under another layer designation e.g. Field and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this alternative implementation under the general layer designation of Field the marking information may be categorized as one sub layer of the Field layer in some cases with additional associated marking sub sub layers and the landmark information may be categorized as another sub layer of the Field layer in some cases with additional associated landmark sub sub layers .

Like the Field layer the Reference layer similarly may have one or more sub layers for various constituent elements of the image information upon which the digital image is rendered. Virtually any number of possible sub layers may be accordingly designated based at least on the various examples of image information discussed above e.g. maps such as road maps or facilities maps dig area indicators either alone or forming part of a digital image grids either alone or forming part of a digital image engineering or architectural drawings photographic renderings etc. any of which may have constituent elements of information that respectively may be categorized as image or Reference sub layers . To provide illustrative non limiting examples of sub layers of the Reference layer indicates a digital image sub layer with the designation a dig area indicator s sub layer with the designation and a grid sub layer with the designation .

The various examples of visual representations illustrated in may be used for various purposes including but not limited to 

According to another aspect of the present invention a marking device includes one or more environmental and or operational sensors which constitute additional examples of input devices from which marking information may be derived. In particular one or more environmental sensors associated with a marking device may provide a variety of environmental information in connection with use of the device similarly one or more operational sensors associated with the marking device may provide a variety of operational information in connection with use of the marking device. One or both of such environmental information and operational information may constitute all or a portion of marking information and may be employed in any of the manners described above in connection with marking information. In particular environmental information and or operational information may be logged stored in local memory of a marking device transferred to and stored in internet accessible memory formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the marking device itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server an internet storage site cellular telephone personal digital assistant PDA etc. for storage processing and or analysis.

As used herein environmental sensors are those which sense some condition of the environment in which the marking device is present but need not sense a condition of the marking device itself. Examples of environmental conditions which may be sensed include but are not limited to temperature humidity light and altitude among others. Environmental sensors may be included with the marking device for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the environmental sensors may be used to assess whether a marking operation was or is being performed in suitable environmental conditions e.g. within accepted environmental tolerances . Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may be used to interact with the technician operating the marking device for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician if the sensed environmental condition is outside of an acceptable range i.e. out of tolerance . Also the information from the environmental sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the marking device such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the marking device. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may augment other information collected by the marking device such as any of the types of information described above as being collected by a marking device according to various embodiments herein. In some instances information from two or more of the environmental sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described in detail below.

As used herein operational sensors are those which sense some operating condition of the marking device. Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to the angle of inclination of the marking device the direction or heading of the marking device a pressure applied to the marking device and or some characteristic of motion of the marking device e.g. the speed at which the marking device is moving the acceleration of the marking device etc. among others. Operational sensors may be included with the marking device for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the operational sensors may be used to assess whether a marking device was or is operating appropriately during a marking operation or whether the marking device was or is being operated e.g. both electronically and or physically manipulated appropriately by the technician e.g. within accepted tolerances or according to protocols . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to detect patterns of operation of the technician such as technician signatures in using manipulating the marking device e.g. characteristic movements unique to the technician . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to interact with the technician for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician in response to the detected operational characteristic falling outside of an acceptable range. Also the information from the operational sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the marking device such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the marking device. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more operational sensors may augment other information collected by the marking device such as any of the types of information previously described herein in connection with other embodiments. Other uses of data provided by one or more operational sensors are also possible and contemplated in the various aspects described herein. In some instances information from two or more operational sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described below. Furthermore information from one or more operational sensors may be used in combination with information from one or more environmental sensors as also described further below.

It should be appreciated that some of the sensors described herein may be considered both environmental and operational sensors either because the sensor senses both an environmental condition and an operating condition of the marking device i.e. the sensor senses more than one condition or because a single condition sensed by the sensor may be considered both an environmental condition and an operating condition. For example an image capture device may be considered both an environmental sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of the surrounding environment and an operational sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of some action the technician has taken such as dispensing of a marker . Furthermore the operation of a sensor may change over time. For example a sensor may be configured at one time to measure an internal operating temperature and at a different time to measure an outside ambient temperature. Thus it should be appreciated that while the sensors described below are categorized generally as being either environmental or operational for purposes of illustrating some exemplary implementations the categories are not mutually exclusive and such categorization is not limiting unless otherwise stated.

With respect to environmental sensors non limiting examples of suitable environmental sensors include a temperature sensor e.g. one or more of an ambient temperature sensor and a surface temperature sensor e.g. a temperature sensor for sensing a temperature of a surface on which marking material is being dispensed a humidity sensor a light sensor an altitude sensor an image capture device e.g. a camera and an audio recorder. This list is not exhaustive however as other types of environmental sensors may be included as appropriate to sense various environmental conditions of interest.

The ambient temperature sensor may be configured to sense the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the marking device . The ambient temperature may be a useful piece of information for example in determining whether the temperature is adverse to performance of the marking operation which may occur when the temperature is too hot or too cold e.g. thereby adversely affecting some characteristic of the marking material itself or dispensing of marking material . For example in some embodiments it may be preferable to operate the marking device only within a predetermined ambient temperature range between 20 F. and 110 F. although other ranges are possible. In addition as described further below the ambient temperature may be useful in combination with one or more other types of environmentally sensed inputs such as humidity in evaluating the conditions in which a marking operation is performed.

The ambient temperature sensor may be any suitable temperature sensor such as an infrared sensor and may be an analog or digital temperature sensor as the various aspects described herein relating to a marking device including an ambient temperature sensor are not limited to using any particular type of temperature sensor. According to one embodiment the temperature sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tenn. In some embodiments the ambient temperature sensor may be suitable to operate between 40 F. and 125 F. or over any other suitable range which in some embodiments may encompass the expected temperatures to which the marking device may be exposed during normal operation. The data output by the ambient temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or may be transmitted to an external device such as remote computer in those embodiments in which the marking device is communicatively coupled to the external device.

The surface temperature sensor may be configured to sense the temperature of the surface on which the marking device is dispensing the marking material e.g. the ground under the marking device . The temperature of the surface may be useful information for various reasons for example in assessing whether the surface temperature is within an acceptable range for dispensing the marking material. As an example some commercially available paints which may be used as a marking material in some embodiments provide recommended temperature ranges for painting such as between 70 F. and 80 F. outside of which the paint may not coat sufficiently dry or remain on the painted surface. Thus as a non limiting example information from the surface temperature sensor may be used to assess whether the marking operation was or is being performed in such recommended temperature conditions. As with the ambient temperature sensor the information provided by the surface temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The surface temperature sensor may be any suitable type of sensor for determining surface temperature such as an infrared temperature sensor or any other suitable type of temperature sensor. In some embodiments the surface temperature sensor may be configured to operate across a range of temperatures encompassing all expected surface temperatures on which marking material may be dispensed during normal operation. For example in one embodiment the surface temperature sensor may operate between 40 F. and 125 F. although other temperature ranges are also possible.

The humidity sensor may be configured to sense the humidity of the environment in which the marking device is used and in some embodiments may provide a relative humidity measurement e.g. 0 to 100 humidity . Such information may be useful alone or in combination with other information in determining whether for example the environment is too humid for performance of the marking operation. For example if the humidity is too great marking material such as paint may not adequately dry and or remain in place on the surface on which it is dispensed. In some embodiments humidity greater than 90 may be adverse to painting although the humidity tolerance may differ for different materials. Thus an acceptable humidity for painting on grass for example may differ from that for painting on concrete or dirt. The humidity information provided by humidity sensor may be used to assess whether a marking operation was or is being performed within acceptable humidity tolerances. The humidity sensor may be any suitable type of humidity sensor as the type is not limiting. According to one embodiment the humidity sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tennessee. The information provided by the humidity sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The light sensor may be configured to sense the intensity flux or illuminance of ambient light in the vicinity of the marking device . Such information may be useful for example to assess whether a marking operation was or is being performed in suitable lighting conditions e.g. whether there was sufficient light to allow for accurate performance of a marking operation whether the area surrounding the marking operation is sufficiently lit to ensure worker safety etc. . The light sensor may be any suitable type of light sensor. In one embodiment the light sensor is a cadmium sulfide CdS photocell which is a photoresistor device whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity. Such a device may provide a resistance or voltage measurement as its output indicative of measured flux. However other types of light sensors may alternatively be used. One non limiting example of a suitable photocell is the PDV P5001 from Advanced Photonix Inc. of Ann Arbor Mich.

The units output by the light sensor may depend on whether the light sensor is sensing light intensity light flux or illuminance. For example the output may be in candela for light intensity lumen for flux or lux for illuminance. According to one embodiment target values for illuminance for accurate performance of a marking operation may be between approximately 1 000 lux and 100 000 lux although other ranges may be appropriate based on a particular location and type of marking operation being performed. According to one embodiment the output may be converted to a percentage between 0 and 100 for example in which 0 corresponds to darkness and 100 corresponds to full sunlight. Other outputs may alternatively be produced. The information provided by the light sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

According to one embodiment the marking device further comprises a light source such as a flashlight or light emitting diode LED torch. The light source may be activated manually e.g. by the technician or may be coupled to the light sensor e.g. directly coupled or coupled through one or more components such as processor and activated automatically in response to the light sensor sensing an unsatisfactorily low lighting condition e.g. by receiving a signal from processor or by directly receiving an output signal of the light sensor . The threshold light level for such automatic activation may be any suitable level non limiting examples of which include any level at which the technician may have difficulty seeing and therefore performing the marking operation and any predetermined level below which technician safety may be comprised. Information about such activation of the light source e.g. the occurrence of the activation the time of activation the duration etc. may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The altitude sensor may be configured to measure the altitude of the marking device and may be any suitable type of altitude sensor for doing so. The altitude at which a marking operation is performed may impact the performance of a marking material e.g. paint and worker safety among other considerations. Thus information about the altitude may be useful for a variety of reasons.

The output of the altitude sensor may be in any suitable units and in some embodiments provides an altitude with respect to sea level. For example the altitude sensor may provide an altitude in meters miles feet or any other suitable units. The information provided by the altitude sensor may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The image capture device may be positioned on the marking device to capture an image of the environment surrounding the marking device may be positioned to capture an image of marking material dispensed by the marking device or may be configured or configurable in any suitable manner to capture any type of image of interest. According to one embodiment a technician may be meant to take a picture of the marking material dispensed during a marking operation and or of an environmental landmark in the vicinity of where marking material is dispensed. Thus inclusion of an image capture device in the marking device may facilitate compliance with such protocols.

The image capture device may be capable of taking still images video images or both as the various aspects described herein relating to marking devices including an image capture device are not limited in this respect. Thus the image capture device may be any suitable type of image capture device and in some embodiments may be a type that is suitable for use in a portable device such as but not limited to the types of digital cameras that may be installed in portable phones wide angle digital cameras degree digital cameras infrared IR cameras and the like. In some implementations a wide angle lens and automatic zoom may be utilized to maximize the coverage area of each image.

The output of the image capture device may include various information. The output may include all or part of a captured image. Additionally or alternatively the output may include information about the settings and or operation of the image capture device such as any one or more of resolution frame rate for video images flash status i.e. flash used or not used image size video sequence duration zoom setting etc.

In those embodiments in which the image capture device is a digital device the images may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . The images may be in any standard or proprietary image file format e.g. JPEG TIFF BMP etc. . Furthermore the images may be associated with a specific job a geographic position and an exact time in some embodiments for example by flagging the image based on the time at which it was taken the location at which it was taken and or the job during which it was taken. In one embodiment each captured image may be cached and transmitted with all other captured data from one or more other sensors input devices.

The environmental sensors may further comprise an audio recorder which may be used to capture audio input from a technician and or from the environment e.g. sounds in the vicinity of the marking device . Thus in one embodiment the technician may for example dictate notes relating to the performance of the marking operation such as describing visible landmarks in the area of the marking operation notes about performance of the marking device or any other notes which may be relevant to performance of a marking operation. In one embodiment the audio recorder may record sounds from the environment such as passing cars planes etc. Such recordings may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician was at the intended location of the marking operation. For example if a passing train is evident from the recording and the intended marking location is not near a train track the recording may provide evidence that the technician was in the wrong location.

The audio recorder may be an analog or digital device or devices. For example in one embodiment the audio recorder may be an analog recorder configured to receive an analog input signal e.g. from a microphone and store the analog signal. According to another embodiment the audio recorder may be a digital audio recorder including any suitable combination of components for receiving an analog signal e.g. from a microphone converting the analog signal to a digital signal performing any suitable digital signal processing e.g. filtering amplifying converting to text etc. and storing the digital information. According to one embodiment the audio recorder may include a dedicated digital audio processor to perform those functions recited or any other suitable functions. It should be appreciated from the foregoing that a microphone not shown in may be associated with the audio recorder to provide the audio input to the audio recorder.

According to one embodiment for example in which a technician may dictate notes the audio processing of the audio input may include performing speech recognition e.g. speech to text generation . Such functionality may be provided by suitable speech recognition software executing on a dedicated audio processor or in any other suitable manner. Any generated text may be for example displayed on a display of the user interface or may be stored for later display on a separate device.

The recordings provided by the audio recorder may be stored in a dedicated audio memory in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . In those embodiments in which the audio recorder is a digital audio recorder the audio files may be in any standard or proprietary audio file format e.g. WAV MP3 etc. .

Although not illustrated in the communication interface of may also serve as or enable another environmental sensor. According to one embodiment the marking device may be internet enabled and information may be received via the communication interface over the internet. According to one embodiment information about an environmental condition may be received via the communication interface. For example temperature information or humidity information among others may be received over the internet via communication interface . In such instances the received temperature or humidity information may augment any temperature and humidity information collected by a temperature and humidity sensor of the marking device or may replace such information such that in some embodiments the marking device may not include a physical temperature or humidity sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that the communication interface may serve as a virtual sensor by receiving environmental information of interest not being limited to temperature and humidity.

As explained above another type of input device which may be included with a marking device is an operational sensor. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention and as shown in the marking device may include one or more operational sensors for sensing one or more operating conditions or characteristics of the marking device.

One or more operational temperature sensors may be configured to sense any temperature of interest with respect to the marking device . For example it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of the processing circuitry of the marking device such as the temperature of the processor . Alternatively it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of other components of the marking device for example the temperature of one of the other operational sensors . Thus it should be appreciated that a plurality of operational temperature sensors may be included and arranged to sense any operating temperatures of interest of the marking device . In this manner the operating temperatures of one or more components of the marking device may be monitored and an alert or notification may be generated e.g. by the control electronics and provided to the technician if one of the operating temperatures is determined to be outside of an acceptable tolerance for example if a component is overheating. Alternatively the temperature from one or more operational temperature sensors may be used to calibrate or compensate data or signals provided by any one of the other sensors which may have a temperature dependent output.

The temperature sensor s may be any suitable temperature sensor such as a temperature dependent variable resistor or any other type of temperature sensor suitable for measuring the temperature of the components of interest of the marking device. The temperature sensor may be configured to operate over any suitable temperature range of interest which in one embodiment may be from 40 F. to 125 F. although other temperature ranges may be employed in other embodiments. The data output by the temperature sensor may be stored in local memory and or may be transmitted to an external device such as remote computer in those embodiments in which the marking device is communicatively coupled to the external device.

The compass may be configured to determine the direction in which the marking device is facing and therefore may be positioned at one of various suitable locations. For example according to one embodiment the compass may be positioned toward the top of the marking device and aligned such that the compass identifies the direction toward which the front of the marking device points i.e. the direction in which the marking device faces when held by the technician . The heading information provided by the compass may be provided in degrees or in any other suitable units and may be provided relative to a reference direction e.g. relative to true North . According to one embodiment the compass may be initially calibrated to true North such that subsequent heading readings may be relative to true North.

The heading information provided by the compass may be useful to determine a direction in which the technician moves during a marking operation. Such information may be particularly useful in instances in which the location tracking system does not provide a signal or a sufficiently accurate signal to monitor the technician s movements. The compass may be any suitable type of compass including analog or digital and may provide any suitable readout. According to one embodiment the compass is a digital compass which provides a heading of the marking device . According to one embodiment the compass may include one or more gyroscopes. According to one embodiment the compass is an O54000 T solid state tilt compensated nano compass available from OceanServer Technology Inc. of Fall River Mass. The information provided by the compass may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The inclinometer may be any suitable inclinometer configurable to measure an angle of inclination of the marking device . According to one embodiment the inclinometer may provide an angle with respect to ground. According to one embodiment the inclinometer may be a multi axis digital device and may sense angles with respect to horizontal and or vertical planes. The inclinometer may provide a voltage as an output signal indicative of the angle of inclination. According to some embodiments the inclinometer may have an output range spanning 30 degrees e.g. with respect to ground although other ranges may alternatively be provided by some inclinometers.

The inclinometer may be positioned toward the top of the marking device for example near where the technician may hold the marking device during use. Alternatively according to another embodiment the inclinometer may be positioned substantially near the tip of the marking device i.e. the end of the marking device from which marking material is dispensed which may be substantially the same as tip of the marking device illustrated in . Other locations for the inclinometer with respect to the marking device are also possible.

The information provided by the inclinometer may be useful for one or more of various purposes. For example according to one embodiment the information about the angle of the marking device may be useful in determining whether the technician is appropriately using the marking device e.g. for determining whether the marking device is being held at a suitable angle relative to the surface e.g. the ground on which marking material is being dispensed to ensure accurate dispensing of the marking material and in some instances may therefore be used to disable the marking dispenser if the technician is holding the marking device at an inappropriate angle. According to another embodiment as described in further detail below in connection with the information about the angle of the marking device may be used to determine the location of one point of the marking device relative to a second point of the marking device e.g. for use in determining the relative positioning of the tip of the marking device compared to the top of the marking device . The information provided by the inclinometer may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

One or more accelerometers may be configured to sense the acceleration of the marking device and may provide an output in terms of g force or in any other suitable units. Such information may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician is appropriately using e.g. physically moving or manipulating the marking device . For example there may be predetermined acceptable acceleration ranges associated with normal operation of the marking device and therefore the accelerometer s may provide information which may be used to assess whether a technician is operating the marking device within those acceptable ranges. In addition any acceleration data provided by the accelerometer s may be integrated to obtain velocity data and or integrated twice to obtain data about distance traveled e.g. via appropriate functionality included in the marking data algorithm or other algorithm executed by the processor either of which integration results may be useful for a variety of reasons. The acceleration information provided by the accelerometer s may be stored in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The accelerometer s may be any suitable accelerometer for sensing the acceleration of the marking device and may provide any suitable outputs. According to one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer providing an indication of the acceleration of the marking device along three orthogonal axes. The output of each axis may be a frequency e.g. in Hz or may be converted to units of g. For example in one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer that outputs a signal ranging from 0.5 Hz 550 Hz for the z axis from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the x axis and from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the y axis. Again the accelerometer may alternatively provide an output in terms of g or any other suitable units. In one exemplary implementation an accelerometer may be an ADXL 330KCPZ RL accelerometer available from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. In some exemplary implementations the accelerometer may output acceleration data whereas in other implementations the accelerometer may output velocity data along each of the three axes as well as the orientation of the accelerometer.

In addition to providing acceleration data an accelerometer may be operated as an inclinometer according to known techniques see e.g. description at http www.tilt china.com uploadPDF How to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer.pdf viewed on Jan. 27 2010 and prepared by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Thus according to one embodiment of the present invention a marking device may include an accelerometer configured to function as an inclinometer and therefore provide a measure of inclination of the marking device.

Furthermore as explained in greater detail below the marking device may comprise a plurality of accelerometers located at different positions with respect to the marking device. Information from such accelerometers may be useful for example in assessing the relative motion of one portion e.g. the tip of the marking device with respect to a second portion e.g. the top of the marking device for example using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. According to one such non limiting embodiment one accelerometer may be positioned near the tip of the marking device and a second accelerometer may be positioned near the top of the marking device. Both may be 3 axis accelerometers. Such an arrangement may also be used to determine the location of the tip of the marking device relative to the location of the top of the marking device as explained below in connection with .

Additionally the data output by one or both accelerometers may be used to monitor for out of tolerance operation of the marking device such as improper manipulation of the marking device by the technician. For example acceleration data from either accelerometer may be indicative of whether the marking device is being swung thrown or dropped among other things. For example acceleration values from either accelerometer above some threshold value for a sufficient duration e.g. for one second or greater or any other suitable duration may be indicative of the marking device being thrown or dropped. The threshold value of acceleration indicative of such behavior may be different for the two accelerometers. Similarly detection of acceleration values deviating from an expected or target pattern may be indicative of misuse of the marking device. In response to detecting such manipulation of the marking device various actions may be taken such as generating an alert logging an event disabling the actuation system of the marking device or any of the actions described further below.

Moreover a marking device may be provided with two accelerometers to monitor whether the marking device is being held in a satisfactory manner during use. For example it may be preferable for a marking device to be maintained at a substantially perpendicular angle relative to ground as a technician is painting even when the technician is moving e.g. swinging the marking device. It should be appreciated that when operated in a such a manner the top of the marking device and the tip of the marking device may exhibit similar acceleration characteristics e.g. peaks in acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion minimum values of acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion etc. By positioning an accelerometer toward the tip of the marking device and another toward the top of the marking device the resulting acceleration data may be indicative of whether the technician is properly manipulating the marking device.

Other uses for multiple accelerometers on a marking device are also possible and those examples listed above are non limiting.

The operational sensors may further comprise a yaw rate sensor which may be configured to sense the yaw rate i.e. a twisting motion of the marking device. The yaw rate sensor may be any suitable yaw rate sensor and may provide its output in any suitable units for example in degrees per second degrees sec . One non limiting example of a suitable yaw rate sensor is an ADXRS610BBGZ RL gyro sensor from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. According to another embodiment a yaw rate measurement may be provided by some types of compasses such that a combination compass and yaw rate sensor may be used. The yaw rate sensor may be positioned at any suitable location on the marking device to detect yaw rate. The information provided by the yaw rate sensor may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The proximity sensor may be configured to measure the distance from any point of interest of the marking device to a point of interest in its surroundings. For example in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned at the tip of the marking device and may be oriented to determine the distance between the tip of the marking device and any surface upon which marking material is being dispensed by the marking device a target surface . Alternatively in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned toward the top of the marking device and oriented to determine a distance between the top of the marking device and the ground. Other configurations are also possible.

Information about the distance from the marking device to any surrounding surface may be useful for one of various reasons. For example such information may be useful in assessing whether a technician is properly operating the marking device. As a non limiting example there may be predetermined acceptable distances between the marking dispenser of the marking device and the surface on which marking material is being dispensed. Some spray paint cans for example are provided with instructions giving recommended distances e.g. between 6 12 inches between the paint can and the surface to be painted. The proximity sensor may be used to determine whether the technician is maintaining the marking device at an acceptable distance from the surface upon which the marking material is being dispensed. Alternatively according to another embodiment and as described in greater detail below the distance of a portion of the marking device from the ground may be useful in determining the distance between two points of the marking device.

The proximity sensor may be any suitable type of proximity sensor e.g. any commercially available proximity sensor including an analog or digital device. In one embodiment proximity sensor may be a Sharp GP2D120 short range IR distance sensor from Sharp Electronics Corporation Mahwah N.J. and is able to take a substantially continuous distance reading and return a corresponding analog voltage with a range of about 1.6 inches to about 12 inches. Such a proximity sensor may be suitable for example when the sensor is used to sense the distance from the tip of the marking device to a surface on which marking material is being dispensed since such a distance may typically be less than about 12 inches. According to another embodiment the proximity sensor may be a sonar device. Other types of proximity sensors may also be suitably used. The information provided by the proximity sensor e.g. a distance value for example in centimeters meters or feet may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The pressure sensor may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the marking device. For example according to one embodiment it may be desirable to detect the pressure applied to a handle of the marking device for instance to determine whether a technician is holding the marking device and if so whether it is being held appropriately. Accordingly a pressure sensor may be positioned in the handle of the marking device in one non limiting embodiment and configured to detect the pressure applied to the handle. According to another embodiment it may be desirable to determine the pressure applied to an actuation system of the marking device for example if the actuation system is a trigger. Accordingly a pressure sensor may be configured to determine the pressure applied to the trigger or other actuation mechanism in those embodiments in which the marking device includes such a trigger or actuation mechanism. According to one embodiment the marking device may include multiple pressure sensors for example one for determining the pressure applied to a handle of the marking device and one for determining a pressure applied to an actuation system of the marking device. However any number of pressure sensors may be included and they may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the marking device.

The pressure sensor may be any suitable type of pressure sensor for detecting the pressure of interest. The information provided by the pressure sensor which may be in any suitable units may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The marking device may further include device health monitoring capability. Characteristics of the health of the marking device which may be the subject of monitoring include but are not limited to battery life battery drain level battery charging capacity wireless signal strength in those embodiments in which the marking device has wireless capabilities network connectivity operating temperature available memory and the status of any one or more input devices of the marking device such as an accelerometer location tracking system e.g. GPS receiver image capture device light sensor marking material detection mechanism etc. To this end the marking device may include hardware and or software configured to serve the health monitoring purpose.

According to one embodiment the marking device may include a processor e.g. processor configured to run a device health software program or application to process the inputs from one or more operational sensors such as operational temperature sensor to assess whether those inputs indicate the marking device is operating appropriately. According to another embodiment the marking device may include dedicated device health hardware such as device health sensor which may provide data that is processed by a device health software program for example executing on processor to assess the health of the marking device. Non limiting examples of device health sensor include a voltmeter and an ammeter among others.

In one embodiment data provided by the device health sensor may indicate that a low battery condition is present during the marking operation and thus it may be determined that the operations of the marking device are not reliable. Other device conditions such as wireless signal strength e.g. in those embodiments in which the marking device is wirelessly coupled to an external device such as remote computer available memory temperature of one or more components of the marking device power connection of one or more components of the marking device or other conditions of the marking device may be monitored by a device health sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that a marking device according to the embodiments described herein may include any suitable number of device health sensors for monitoring a desired number of device conditions.

According to one embodiment a record or message may be created based on operation of the device health sensor. For example a record or message may be created including a device ID e.g. of the marking device and the current state of certain device components such as input devices e.g. environmental and operational sensors . The record or message may also or alternatively include an identification of any resource utilization that is nearing a specified threshold e.g. memory nearing capacity . Thus it should be appreciated that various conditions may be monitored under the rubric of monitoring the health of the marking device and various actions taken in response to such monitoring.

The operational sensors may further comprise the image capture device . As previously mentioned the image capture device may be considered an operational sensor for example if and when configured to capture an image relating to the operation of the marking device . In one embodiment the image capture device may be configured to capture an image of any marking material dispensed by the marking device . Such an image may be used to verify that a marking material was appropriately placed on ground pavement or other surface in the context of its surroundings. Images of dispensed marking material such as a paint also may be used to verify that the marking material appropriately coated and adhered to a surface on which it was dispensed. Images of marking material as it is being dispensed also may be used to ascertain and or verify some attribute or characteristic of the marking material itself. Concepts relating to determination of various marking material attributes using a variety of techniques are discussed in U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 429 947 filed Apr. 24 2009 and entitled MARKER DETECTION MECHANISMS FOR USE IN MARKING DEVICES AND METHODS OF USING SAME published as U.S. Patent Publication 2010 0006667 A1 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

Furthermore the operational sensors may comprise an audio recorder similar to or the same as audio recorder and therefore shown as audio recorder in . For example the marking device may include multiple audio recorders with one or more operating as an environmental sensor e.g. recording acoustic input from the environment and one or more operating as operational sensors e.g. recording acoustic input relating to operation of one or more components of the marking device as described below with respect to the marking dispenser . According to one non limiting embodiment an audio recorder may be configured to record audio input corresponding to the sound created by dispensing of marking material from the marking dispenser . For example in one embodiment the marking dispenser may comprise an aerosol paint can and the marking material may be the paint. A sound is often emitted when the aerosol paint can is activated. The frequency of that sound may depend on and therefore be indicative of what is being dispensed from the paint can. For example in one embodiment the paint can may have a fixed resonance frequency with resonance sidebands. The frequency of the resonance sidebands may vary depending on the amount of paint in the paint can such that the resonance sidebands may move closer in terms of frequency to the fixed resonance frequency as the amount of paint in the paint can decreases. Thus by suitable detection of the resonance sidebands during actuation of the paint can a determination may be made whether paint is being dispensed or not. Also if no paint or propellant is being dispensed from the paint can e.g. when the paint can is empty of both paint and propellant or if the paint can is not functioning then no sound may be emitted. A non limiting example is now given.

According to one embodiment the frequency amplitude of the sound generated by the paint can may be tracked over time to assess an amount of paint in the paint can and or whether paint is being dispensed. If the amplitude of a particular frequency of interest remains above a threshold value for a threshold duration it may be determined that paint is being dispensed. By contrast if the amplitude of the frequency of interest does not remain above the threshold value for the threshold duration it may be determined that the paint can is not dispensing paint e.g. because the paint can is substantially empty of paint or is not functioning.

According to one embodiment a method of determining whether paint is being emitted from a marking dispenser may begin by calibrating the audio recorder to account for background noise although not all embodiments involve such a calibration routine. A microphone associated with the audio recorder is positioned to detect sound emitted when a paint can serving as the marking dispenser in this non limiting embodiment is activated. Thus according to one embodiment the microphone may be positioned proximate the tip of the marking device an example of which is shown later in which illustrates a microphone near the tip of the marking device . The analog signal from the microphone may be digitized by sampling at 20 kHz or any other suitable sampling rate. The digital data may then be low pass filtered for example by a processor e.g. processor described below . According to one embodiment the low pass filter has a passband at approximately 3.3 kHz although any suitable passband may be used. The data from the low pass filter may then be squared in value which removes any negative values. The resulting data may then be low pass filtered for example using the same processor which performed the first low pass filtering function or any other suitable hardware and or software. This second low pass filtering step may have a passband at approximately 50 Hz although any suitable passband may be used.

The amplitude of the signal output by the second low pass filtering step may then be compared against a threshold amplitude selected to be indicative of the amount of paint in the paint can and or being dispensed. If the amplitude exceeds the threshold amplitude for a sufficient duration e.g. 50 milliseconds 25 milliseconds or any other suitable duration then the data suggests that the paint can contains paint since such a result may occur when the resonance frequency sidebands of the paint can are sufficiently far from the fixed resonance frequency. By contrast if the amplitude does not exceed the threshold amplitude for the threshold duration then the data suggests that the paint can contains little or no paint. The threshold amplitude may be selected based on characteristics of the subject paint can among other things.

It should be appreciated that other methods of processing the audio input are also possible as this is only one example. In addition other uses of the audio recorder information i.e. other than determining if marking material has been dispensed are possible. Furthermore it should be appreciated that the audio input may also be stored by the audio recorder.

As previously described the audio recorder may be any suitable audio recorder including a digital audio recorder or analog audio recorder for example of any of the types previously described. In one embodiment the audio recorder may comprise a dedicated PIC processor as described further below with respect to . In those embodiments in which the marking device includes two or more audio recorders e.g. one operating as an environmental sensor and another operating as an operational sensor the audio recorders may share any suitable combination of circuitry. For example multiple audio recorders may share a same digital signal processor e.g. a dedicated audio signal processor . A separate microphone may be associated with each audio recorder or a microphone may be shared between two or more audio recorders. Thus it should be appreciated that the exact configuration and components of audio recorders according to the various embodiments described herein are not limiting.

The audio files produced by an audio recorder operating as an operational sensor may be stored locally in dedicated audio memory in local memory and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

In any of the embodiments illustrated in any one or more of the environmental sensors illustrated in and or operational sensors illustrated in may be operated in any suitable manner including continuously periodically and or in response to an event or trigger e.g. one or more actuations of the marking device or in any other suitable manner. For example one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate continuously during performance of a marking operation. In particular the ambient temperature sensor may output a substantially continuous data stream indicative of the sensed ambient temperature. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor light sensor and altitude sensor may output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the respective sensed conditions. The inclinometer compass accelerometer yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor may also output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the sensed operation. The image capture device may record a video sequence continuously during the marking operation and the audio recorder may continuously record any audio input during performance of the marking operation.

Alternatively one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated and or polled periodically with the resulting output data being logged and or transmitted periodically. For example the ambient temperature sensor may provide an output signal indicative of the sensed ambient temperature every second every five seconds every ten seconds every minute every ten minutes or at any other suitable time interval. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor light sensor altitude sensor operational temperature sensor s inclinometer compass accelerometer s yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor s may output data at periodic intervals. The image capture device may capture a still image or a video sequence of any desired duration at periodic intervals. The audio recorder may capture audio of any desired duration at periodic intervals. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may themselves operate so as to provide output information in an essentially continuous fashion but only be read or polled e.g. by processor on some discrete or periodic basis. Accordingly output signals or data provided by one or more sensors may be acquired logged into local memory and or transmitted to an external device in any of a variety of manners.

According to another embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate be read discretely and or be polled and therefore the corresponding data may be logged and or transmitted in response to actuation of the actuation system of the marking device. For example actuation of the actuation system may trigger dispensing of marking material and simultaneously may trigger recording of a sensed ambient temperature from ambient temperature sensor in the local memory . The remaining environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated read and or polled in a similar manner.

In one embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be activated read discretely and or polled by the technician irrespective of whether the actuation system is actuated. For example the technician may activate read and or poll one or more of the environmental sensors by depressing a selection button corresponding to the environmental sensor s by choosing a selection button or menu option from a user interface of the marking device in those embodiments in which the marking device includes a user interface or in any other suitable manner. The operational sensors may operate similarly.

Thus it should be appreciated that the operation of sensors and reading and or logging and or transmitting of data from the environmental sensors and operational sensors is not limited to any particular manner or time but rather that various suitable schemes are contemplated. Also it should be appreciated that in those embodiments in which a marking device comprises multiple sensors the sensors need not operate in the same manner as each other. For example one or more of the sensors may operate periodically while one or more may only provide their data output in response to actuation of the marking device actuation system. In one embodiment a plurality of the sensors may provide their data outputs periodically but at different rates. Other operating schemes are also possible.

With reference to the marking device includes control electronics environmental sensors operational sensors as well as some additional components. The control electronics include a processor which in this non limiting example is an Atom processor available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara Calif. The processor is on a processor board that also includes a temperature sensor configured to monitor the processor temperature. In this manner the processor temperature may be monitored for overheating or other adverse temperature conditions. The control electronics further comprise a battery which provides power to the various components of the marking device .

Several of the components of the marking device are connected directly to the processor . For example a compass is connected to and provides its output directly to the processor . Similarly a location tracking system e.g. a GPS receiver such as the ISM300F1 C3 GPS module from Inventek Systems of Billerica Mass. is directly coupled to the processor to provide its output to the processor. Additionally the marking device comprises Wi Fi capability provided by communications interface in the form of a Wi Fi module having a Wi Fi antenna . The Wi Fi module is coupled directly to the processor via a USB connection in this non limiting example.

The marking device further comprises a sensor board which is connected to several sensors itself includes several sensors and is coupled to the processor to provide various data to the processor and receive control signals from the processor . The sensor board comprises two processors labeled as and . The processor which is a PIC processor in this non limiting example for example PIC24FJ256GA106 I PT from Microchip Technology Inc. of Chandler Ariz. may be configured to receive data from various of the sensors of the marking device and to communicate with the processor . The processor may be a dedicated digital signal audio processor and may be for example a PIC processor such as DSPIC30F301230ISO ND from Microchip Technology Inc. of Chandler Ariz. Processor may receive audio input from a microphone and may process the audio input and provide it to the processor . The sensor board further comprises a temperature sensor configured to monitor the temperature of the sensor board to determine whether any of the components of the sensor board are overheating. The sensor board further comprises an accelerometer which is a 3 access accelerometer in this non limiting embodiment as well as memory which in this non limiting example is EEPROM.

As shown various sensors and other components of the marking device are electrically coupled to the sensor board for example to provide their outputs to the processor . For example the marking device comprises a joystick and user interface buttons which provide their outputs to the processor . A technician using the marking device may use the joystick and buttons for example joystick SKQUCAA010 from Alps Electric Co. Ltd. and pushbutton module TL11078F180WQ from E Switch Inc. of Minneapolis Minn. to interact with the marking device for example to navigate menus presented on the display of the marking device and to make user selected entries. The marking device may further comprise a board having on it a temperature sensor a humidity sensor and a light sensor . The temperature sensor may be configured to detect the air temperature outside of the marking device. The humidity sensor may be configured to detect the humidity of the environment in which the marking device is located. The light sensor may be configured to detect the light intensity light flux or illuminance of the environment in which the marking device is being used. Each of those three sensors may be connected to the sensor board and provide their output signals to the processor .

Furthermore the marking device may comprise various additional sensors which as discussed below with respect to may be located in the tip of the marking device. These include a paint can detection switch a 3 axis accelerometer a yaw rate sensor the previously described microphone and an RFID module e.g. an RFID read write module . The outputs of these sensors may also be provided to the processor on the sensor board . In addition the marking device may comprise another PIC processor such as a PIC processor configured to digitize the output signals of the 3 axis accelerometer and the yaw rate detector located in the tip of the marking device prior to providing those outputs to processor .

The marking device also includes a trigger for actuating the marking device. The trigger may be coupled to the sensor board and in particular to the processor in this non limiting example. Additionally a mode selection switch may be associated with the trigger such that the processor may detect not only when the trigger is actuated but also what mode is involved. Examples of suitable modes include paint mode in which actuation of the trigger causes the dispensing of a marking material such as paint and landmark mode in which actuation of the trigger may not result in dispensing of marking material but may result in data collection. Other modes are also possible as these examples are non limiting.

In addition as shown the marking device may further comprise a speaker which may be used to provide audio output to the technician using the marking device. To facilitate this functionality the marking device may further comprise an audio board coupled between the processor and the sensor board . The audio board may receive digital signals from the processor and convert them to analog signals which may be provided to the sensor board to drive the speaker .

Also as mentioned the marking device comprises a display which may be connected to the sensor board and which in some embodiments may be mounted directly to the sensor board .

Although not shown in various forms of memory may be provided with the marking device . For example the processor may include RAM as well as a flash memory or any other suitable types of memory. Data output from any of the sensors or components of the marking device may be stored in the memory of the processor . Each of the processors and may include internal flash memory as well as RAM.

To provide electrical isolation between various components of the marking device for example to prevent electrical cross talk or interference one or more electrical shields may be included. In the illustrated embodiment a shield may be provided to electrically shield the compass from the location tracking system e.g. GPS receiver and from the processor as well as to shield the location tracking system from the processor . According to one embodiment the compass may be shielded by a metallic enclosure e.g. a copper box which may provide shielding from interference caused by other components of the marking device as well as shielding from the environment.

As shown the marking device also comprises a docking interface to facilitate docking the marking device to a docking station. The docking station may be a device configured to receive the marking device when the marking device is not in use to perform a marking operation and may be for example any of the types of docking stations described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 571 411 filed on Sep. 30 2009 and titled Marking Device Docking Stations and Methods of Using Same which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. According to one embodiment the marking device may make both electrical and mechanical connection to the docking station when docked such that the docking interface may be configured to provide both electrical and mechanical connection. While docked the marking device battery may be charged and or the marking device may exchange information with the docking station. For example the marking device may transfer any collected marking data to the docking station. Other functions may also be performed by the docking station as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 571 411.

Docking events e.g. docking and de docking of a marking device may be recorded as event entries for example similar in form to the event entries of Tables 2 5. Table 14A illustrates an example of event entry indicating a change in docking status of a marking device. Other entry formats are also possible.

In general the components of marking device may operate in any of the manners previously described with respect to marking devices environmental sensors and operational sensors. However in one non limiting embodiment the various sensors of marking device may operate at different rates. As an example the accelerometers and yaw rate sensor of the marking device may output their data at relatively high frequencies such as in the kHz range MHz range or higher. The temperature sensors humidity sensor and light sensor may output their data at relatively lower frequencies such as approximately 1 Hz for example because those quantities may not change as rapidly as the quantities measured by the accelerometers and the yaw rate sensor. The joystick and buttons may output their data at an intermediate frequency for example 10 Hz. Lastly the RFID sensor of RFID module may output its data only when the paint can detection switch changes state corresponding to insertion or removal of a paint can. In this manner power may be conserved by operating the RFID sensor only when needed.

According to one embodiment the output data from the sensors is only read and stored upon actuation of the trigger even though the sensors may update their outputs at the above indicated frequencies. Upon such actuation data from any one or more of the sensors may be read out and stored in the memory of processor . The stored data may therefore represent the values present at the sensors at the time of actuation. In this manner data values output by the sensors when the trigger is not actuated may not be stored in some instances but rather may be updated by the subsequent data value from the sensor. In this manner only the most recent data from the sensors may be stored upon actuation.

As shown the accelerometer and a yaw rate sensor are located toward the tip of the marking device on a first circuit board. Processor for example a PIC processor such as a PIC18F2431 I SO from Microchip Technology Inc. of Chandler Ariz. is disposed on a second circuit board coupled to the circuit board including the accelerometer and the yaw rate sensor and is configured to receive the outputs from the accelerometer and yaw rate sensor digitize them and send them to the sensor board . The can detection switch is included to detect insertion and removal of paint can from the marking device. The microphone is configured to detect sound emitted when paint is dispensed from the paint can and provides its output to processor shown in . The RFID board is oriented vertically within the figure and includes the RFID module which may include an RFID reader configured to read an RFID tag on the paint can or on the lid of the paint can for example to determine product information relating to the paint can .

It should be appreciated that other electrical and physical configurations of a marking device including one or more environmental and or operational sensors are possible and that illustrate one non limiting example.

As mentioned previously environmental information and or operational information output by any one or more environmental sensors and operational sensors of the marking device e.g. of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used for one or more of various purposes some of which have been previously described. Examples of such purposes include assessing whether a marking operation was or is being performed within environmental and or operational tolerances interacting with the technician and or controlling altering operation of the marking device and augmenting data records files.

To this end the various environmental information and or operational information provided by various sensors may be organized and handled as data in various formats and in some implementations may be organized in terms of events and corresponding event entries formatted according to a particular protocol for example as discussed above in connection with Tables 2 through 5. Event entries similar to these and including various environmental and or operational information may be generated by the marking device at some point once information has been read acquired from environmental and or operational sensors the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be transmitted by the marking device e.g. to remote computer .

In some implementations environmental information and or operational information may be contained within one or more event entries corresponding to an actuation of the marking device such that the environmental information and or the operational information is part of an actuation data set. Table 15 below illustrates a modification of an event entry originally depicted in Table 3 above in which environmental information and operational information is included as part of the data formatted in an actuation state change event entry according to one example. The information for acceleration may include three values for each axis of each accelerometer. One value for a particular axis may be a raw value the second value for a particular axis may be a high pass filtered value and the third value may be a low pass filtered value. Data values are only shown for one of the two accelerometers listed. As in Table 3 for purposes of this event format the actuator is deemed to have three possible states i.e. PRESSED HELD and RELEASED. Marking information from one or more input devices other components of the marking device is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

The contents of an information field for a particular piece of environmental information and or operational information in an event entry may have any of a number of forms for example the content may be strictly numeric e.g. according to some predetermined scale units of measure for the numeric information alphanumeric e.g. 78F text e.g. YES symbolic e.g. Y or N to indicate yes or no or some other symbol to provide an indication such as to indicate sensor failure or no sensor information available or referential in nature e.g. a filename pointer or other link to provide an indication of where relevant information relating to the particular environmental and or operational condition may be found .

In other implementations one or both of environmental information and or operational information may be formatted in one or more particular event entries generated specifically to provide such information in a manner that is not necessarily related to actuation of the marking device. For example such sensor read events may be generated as the result of the processor reading one or more environmental and or operational sensors one or more times while a job is in progress e.g. on a periodic basis pursuant to processor polls . Table 16 below provides an example of such a sensor read event entry.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including event entries or information derived therefrom as discussed above any number of file formats may be employed e.g. ASCII XML .

The exemplary electronic record shown in may be used to evaluate performance of a marking operation for example by reviewing information in the actuation data set C the ticket information service related information the environmental information and or the operational information . It should be appreciated that the electronic record includes some information that assumes that the marking device or includes the timing system and the location tracking system such as the timing and location information shown in the electronic record.

Table 17 provides an example of a data record that may be generated by marking device or marking device upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the marking device identification a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system product data for the marking material being dispensed locate request data and information relating to the environmental sensors . This example is provided for purposes of illustration and is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the marking devices and .

In a manner similar to Table 17 Table 18 provides another example of a data record that may be generated by marking device or upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the device identification a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system product data for the marking material being dispensed locate request data and information relating to the operational sensors . The location tracking system provides the geo location data. The temperature sensor s provides the temperature data. The compass provides the heading. The inclinometer provides the inclination. The accelerometer s provides the acceleration which in this embodiment is a three axis accelerometer. The yaw rate sensor provides the yaw rate. The proximity sensor provides the distance which may represent the distance from the tip of the marking device to the ground in one non limiting embodiment. The pressure sensor provides the pressure measurement. This example is provided for purposes of illustration and is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the marking device or .

While Tables 17 and 18 respectively indicate the collection of environmental information and operational information separately and as part of an actuation data set it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. In particular both environmental information and operational information may be collected together as part of a given actuation data set. Furthermore the inclusion of one or both of environmental information and operational information in an electronic record such as the record need not be limited to one or more particular actuations data sets rather in some exemplary implementations one or both of environmental information and operational information may be included as a unique component of an electronic record apart from any particular actuation data set e.g. one or both of environmental and operational information may be common to or shared by one or more actuation data sets .

Environmental information and or operational information as well as any of the other constituent components of marking information and landmark information discussed herein may be used to assess whether a marking device is being used and or a marking operation was or is being performed in accordance with recommended practices or within recommended environmental or operational conditions.

As an illustrative example there may be certain preferred environmental conditions in which a marking device may be used and or a marking operation may be performed particularly with respect to storage handling and dispensing of the marking material. In particular the marking material manufacturer may specify an ideal temperature a maximum temperature a minimum temperature an ideal humidity a maximum humidity and the like for the use of their product. Accordingly the use of the marking material above the maximum temperature specification below the minimum temperature specification and or above the maximum humidity specification may yield undesirable results such as an uneven spray poor adhesion to the surface on which it is sprayed and or poor durability. This may result in marginally or poorly performed marking operations which may have an adverse impact on customer satisfaction and an increased risk of damage to facilities.

Additionally there may be certain preferred process tolerances with respect to performing marking operations. For example there may be a minimum ambient light specification a certain angle of spray specification with respect to dispensing of marking material a certain distance specification i.e. distance from target surface with respect to dispensing of marking material a certain motion specification with respect to sweeping the marking device and the like. Violations of these process tolerances may result in poorly performed marking operations which may result in poor customer satisfaction and an increased risk of damage to facilities.

Other environmental and operational tolerances may also be applicable to marking operations and it should be appreciated that those listed above are non limiting examples provided for purposes of illustration.

In view of the foregoing according to another aspect of the present invention a marking device or a locate operations system comprising a marking device may include an operations monitoring application that operates in combination with the marking device or that is installed fully or in part on the marking device. In exemplary implementations discussed below an operations monitoring application may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment such as the marking devices described herein for out of tolerance environmental or operational conditions. For example with respect to marking material that is dispensed during marking operations the operations monitoring application of the present disclosure may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of the marking material within the limits of its product specifications with respect to for example the ambient temperature and humidity. Additionally or alternatively monitoring may be based on certain standard operating procedures e.g. as established by a facility owner a locate contractor a regulatory body etc. . Other bases for monitoring the operation of a marking device may also be used.

According to one aspect of this embodiment once an out of tolerance condition is detected either environmental or operational an out of tolerance alert or notification may be provided to the user technician of the marking device. In some exemplary implementations the out of tolerance alert may be generated by the control electronics of the marking device although not all implementations are limited in this respect. Additionally or alternatively a record of such out of tolerance alerts may be stored such as a record of alert acknowledgments that may be stored or transmitted by the marking device in response to technician acknowledgement of the alert.

An example of an operations monitoring application is now described. For purposes of illustration the operations monitoring application is described in connection with marking device discussed above in connection with . However it should be appreciated that the operations monitoring application may be used in connection with other marking devices described herein.

Referring to a functional block diagram of an example of an operations monitoring application for detecting and monitoring the use of a marking device e.g. marking device in this non limiting example for out of tolerance conditions is presented. Operations monitoring application may include an operations algorithm which is a software algorithm for determining whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions are present during locate operations and or whether violations of certain process operational tolerances occur.

To make determinations of out of tolerance conditions occurrences operations algorithm may compare information supplied at an expected data input to information supplied at an actual data input . For example an operating limits table may provide the source of information feeding expected data input . An example of the contents of operating limits table is shown in Table 19 below. It should be appreciated that such a table may include entries for any one or more conditions sensed by a sensor of the marking device and that those entries shown are non limiting examples.

The contents of operating limits table may be informed by standard operating procedures SOP information . In this respect the contents of operating limits table may have a dynamic component. That is in the event that the content of SOP information is modified and or that the content of SOP information varies for example from one geographic location to another or from one job work site to another the content of operating limits table may automatically vary accordingly. SOP information may include information such as but not limited to state local and or regional regulations with respect to underground facility locate and marking operations locate service provider policy information contractual information and the like. Further SOP information may include information about the current industry accepted best practices and or procedures with respect to underground facility locate and marking operations.

One source of information that may be included in SOP information may be for example the information of the Best Practices Version 6.0 document published in February 2009 by the Common Ground Alliance CGA of Alexandria Va. www.commongroundalliance.com incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Best Practices Version 6.0 document is a compilation of the current best practices that are performed with respect to preventing damage to underground facilities. Another source of information that may be included in SOP information may be for example the information of the Recommended Marking Guidelines For Underground Utilities as endorsed by the National Utility Locating Contractors Association NULCA of North Kansas City Mo. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Generally the contents of operating limits table may be variable and dynamic based on one or more factors such as but not limited to dynamic information that may be included in SOP information best practices that may vary with time of year best practices that may vary with time of day best practices that may vary with weather conditions best practices that may vary with the skill level of the locate technician and the like.

According to one embodiment the information supplied to actual data input is generated and or collected in real time during marking operations that are performed in the field. For example the source of information feeding actual data input may be the marking device although marking device is only a non limiting example as any of the marking devices described herein may be used. The actual data input may be fed with the data from one or more of the sensors and which data is indicated generally in as sensor data .

Referring again to Table 19 the values that are contained in operating limits table may be expressed in terms that correspond to the data format that is returned from sensor devices and . For example in one embodiment the light sensor output may be a voltage and thus the ambient light level may be expressed in volts in operating limits table . However the values in table are not limited to being in any particular format as discussed above in connection with Tables 15 18.

Operations algorithm may compare the information of operating limits table that is present at expected data input to the information of sensor data that is present at actual data input to determine whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions and or violations of certain process tolerances are present during marking operations. In one example operations algorithm may determine whether marking operations are being performed when the ambient temperature is too hot or too cold or when the ambient humidity is too high. In another example operations algorithm may determine whether the spray angle or spray distance detected during marking operations exceed acceptable parameters. In yet another example operations algorithm may determine whether marking operations are being performed when it is too dark based on a comparison of a sensed light level to a light level specification.

When out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions and or violations of certain process specifications are detected operations algorithm may generate out of tolerance alerts the contents of which may reflect the nature of the out of tolerance condition. The alerts may take any suitable form such as an audible alert a chime a ring tone a verbal message or command e.g. synthesized speech provided by a text to speech synthesizer of the marking device etc. for example presented via speaker a visual alert e.g. a text display presented via display an indicator light etc. a tactile alert e.g. vibration of a tactile indicator as described below in connection with any combination of those options or any other suitable type of notification.

Any out of tolerance alerts that are generated may be logged in an alerts log of operations monitoring application . Further in those embodiments in which the operations monitoring application is not loaded and running on the marking device itself any out of tolerance alerts that are generated may be transmitted to the marking device in which the control electronics may process the out of tolerance alerts . For example control electronics may receive out of tolerance alerts and present the contents thereof to the user of marking device e.g. visually and or audibly via the display and or speaker via a tactile indicator etc. .

Additionally control electronics may generate alert acknowledgments that correspond to out of tolerance alerts . Alert acknowledgments may be returned to operations monitoring application and logged in alerts log . Alert acknowledgments provide evidence that out of tolerance alerts have been received and processed at marking device . The contents of alerts log may be useful to various business applications with respect to marking operations. For example the contents of alerts log may be useful to business applications for assessing the quality of marking operations that are performed in the field assessing the skill and or competency levels of technicians and the like. In a specific example out of tolerance alerts in alerts log may be monitored in real time by for example management personnel of locate companies e.g. locate contractors facility owners regulatory authorities or other agencies wherein certain actions in response to out of tolerance alerts may be initiated in real time by the management personnel.

In one implementation operations monitoring application may be installed and executing on a computing device not shown that is separate from marking device but in communication with the marking device such as remote computer . In another implementation operations monitoring application may be installed in memory and executing via one or more processors on a marking device itself such the marking device . In yet another implementation certain functionality and or components of operations monitoring application may be installed and executing fully or in part on the combination of a separate computing device and a marking device e.g. marking device .

To facilitate operation of a marking device e.g. marking device with operations monitoring application of when the application is executed partly or entirely on a separate computing device e.g. remote computer the marking device may have loaded thereon an operations monitoring client which may be a counterpart to operations monitoring application . For example the operations monitoring client may be executed by the processor and may process information of operations monitoring application . Alternatively the operations monitoring client may comprise a combination of hardware and software and or firmware which may be coupled to the marking device to communicate with the processor . In such an embodiment the software and or firmware may process information of operations monitoring application . Alternatively as noted above the control electronics of the marking device may include fully or in part operations monitoring application itself.

Table 20 shows an example of sensor data that may be returned from environmental sensors and operational sensors . Further sensor data may include timestamp information for example from the timing system .

Non limiting examples of how the data provided by the environmental sensors and operational sensors may be used by the operations monitoring application are now given. It should be appreciated that numerous other conditions may be detected and acted upon.

Other conditions and events that may arise with the operations monitoring application and which may trigger an alert or notification to the technician include but are not limited to the following 

In the examples above alert acknowledgments in response to out of tolerance alerts may take various forms. In one example the technician may acknowledge using the user interface for example by pushing a button flipping a switch or selecting a menu option depending on the type of user interface. Different user inputs buttons toggles menu selections etc. may have different meanings with respect to providing alert acknowledgments . Table 21 below shows an example of alert acknowledgments wherein as a non limiting example certain keys of a user interface of the marking device have certain meanings.

In another example a dropdown menu and or a set of icons that include the various types of alert acknowledgments such as shown in Table 21 may be presented on the display of the marking device. The user may then select the desired type of alert acknowledgment from the dropdown menu and or icons.

Also as mentioned above out of tolerance conditions and other conditions detected by the environmental and or operational sensors may be logged for example into alerts log irrespective of whether an alert is provided to the technician. Thus for any of the above described examples in which an alert may be generated a log of the detected condition may also or alternatively be made. Also other conditions than those described above may be logged.

Residing on central server may be business applications which may be any business applications that may be useful with respect to locate and marking operations. In one example business applications may include a locate and marking operations scoring application that processes information about locate operations and generates locate operations scores that may indicate the degree of quality of individual locate operations. Additionally SOP information may reside at central server and may be accessed by operations monitoring application and or any entity of locate operations system via network .

For example locate operations scoring application may be based on various embodiments of a quality assessment application as well as any one or more of the scoring criteria and or exemplary metrics disclosed in connection with such quality assessment applications as set forth in U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 493 109 filed Jun. 26 2009 entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF A FIELD SERVICE OPERATION and published as U.S. Patent Publication 2009 0327024 A1 which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular a quality assessment application may be configured to receive a variety of information germane to locate and marking operations and compare such information to expected values or benchmarks metrics based on various criteria. A scoring algorithm implemented as part of some implementations of a quality assessment application may compare various input information e.g. field information as obtained from one or more pieces of locating equipment such as a marking device to the expected values or benchmarks to generate a quality assessment score in an automated fashion.

In another example business applications may include a ticket approval application that processes information about locate and marking operations and generates ticket approval outcomes that again may indicate the degree of quality of individual locate and marking operations. For example ticket approval application may be based on the ticket approval system that is described in U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 204 454 filed Sep. 4 2008 entitled TICKET APPROVAL SYSTEM FOR AND METHOD OF PERFORMING QUALITY CONTROL IN FIELD SERVICE APPLICATIONS and published as U.S. Patent Publication 2009 0204466 A1 which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application describes a ticket approval system for and method of performing quality control QC in field service applications. The ticket approval system may include a work management server. The work management server may include a ticket approval software application and a database for storing digital ticket information such as field service site identification information manifest information and digital images of field service activities. A method of performing QC may include but is not limited to the field technician completing the ticket and providing data images an approver viewing and selecting a certain field technician and ticket for quality control review the approver reviewing data images of the selected ticket the approver approving the ticket the approver tagging the ticket for QC a QC approver processing QC referrals the QC approver routing the ticket to a QC technician the QC technician completing the QC tasks and updating the data images of the selected ticket the approver tagging the ticket for coaching the approver processing coaching referrals and the approver performing coaching tasks.

Network may be for example any local area network LAN and or wide area network WAN for connecting to the Internet. In one non limiting embodiment network provides the communication link between any and or all entities of locate operations system . For example network provides the communication network by which information may be exchanged between central server one or more onsite computers and or locating equipment e.g. marking device that are used by locate technicians in the field.

Onsite computers may be any computing devices that are capable of processing and executing program instructions. Onsite computers may be used by locate technicians that are performing locate and marking operations in the field. For example each onsite computer may be a portable computer a personal computer a tablet device a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular radiotelephone a mobile computing device a touch screen device a touchpad device or generally any device including or connected to a processor and a user interface. Preferably each onsite computer is a portable computing device such as laptop computer or tablet device. Onsite computers may be used by locate technicians to process locate request tickets not shown and to perform locate and marking operations accordingly.

Additionally operations monitoring application may be installed on onsite computers . For example operations monitoring application may be used to process information received from or transmitted to marking device . Each onsite computer may include a processing unit which may be any standard controller or microprocessor device that is capable of executing program instructions such as those from operations monitoring application . Each onsite computer may also include a quantity of memory which may be any data storage mechanism for storing any information that is processed locally at onsite computer . Processing unit and memory may be used for managing the overall operations of onsite computer .

Further each onsite computer may include a communication interface for connecting to network and or for communication with locating equipment. For example communication interface may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between any entities of locate operations system .

Operations monitoring application is used in locate operations system for detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment e.g. marking device in out of tolerance conditions as described above. For example operations algorithm of operations monitoring application determines whether out of tolerance environmental and or operational conditions are present during locate operations and or whether violations of certain process tolerances are present during locate operations. Optionally operations monitoring application may be used to automatically enable and disable either electrically mechanically or both locating equipment in the field based on certain out of tolerance conditions being present.

Further locate operations system is not limited to the types and numbers of entities that are shown in . Any types and numbers of entities that may be useful in underground facilities locate applications may be included in locate operations system . More details of a method of detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment for out of tolerance conditions by use of locate operations system are described with reference to .

At step onsite computer or the marking device itself may detect powering up e.g. a power on state and or one more specific events e.g. docking de docking of a marking device one or more actuations error conditions technician interaction with a user interface etc. associated with a marking device such as marking device or . Additionally the relevant SOP information is acquired. For example using location tracking system of marking device the geo location of the job work site may be determined. Based on this geo location information operations monitoring application automatically queries SOP information at central server for the SOP information of the regulatory body that corresponds to the location of the work site which is used to inform operating limits table of operations monitoring application .

Subsequently operations monitoring application at onsite computer may begin monitoring the environmental and or operating conditions associated with use of the marking device. For example operations algorithm of operations monitoring application begins monitoring sensor data that is returned from marking device and compares the contents of sensor data to information in operating limits table .

At decision step operations algorithm of operations monitoring application determines whether any out of tolerance conditions are present. For example if any one of the following out of tolerance conditions is present method may proceed to step . However if none of the following out of tolerance conditions are present method may proceed to step . The following out of tolerance conditions are exemplary only and not meant to be limiting.

At step operations monitoring application continues to monitor the conditions e.g. environmental and or operating of the marking device during marking operations. For example operations monitoring application at onsite computer continues to monitor the conditions of the marking device during marking operations by comparing the contents of sensor data to information in operating limits table . At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step .

At step operations monitoring application generates the corresponding out of tolerance alert logs the out of tolerance alert in alerts log and transmits the out of tolerance alert to the locating equipment such as to marking device in those embodiments in which the method is not entirely implemented on the marking device itself. By way of example the following out of tolerance alerts correspond respectively to the example out of tolerance conditions of step . The following out of tolerance alerts are exemplary only and not meant to be limiting.

At step one or more out of tolerance alerts are received at the locating equipment such as marking device in those embodiments in which alerts are not generated on the marking device itself. The out of tolerance alerts may be presented to the user in for example text form via a display of the marking device audible form e.g. synthesized speech provided by a text to speech synthesizer of the marking device via a speaker of the marking device or in any other suitable manner.

At step a certain alert acknowledgment may be returned to operations monitoring application . For example the user such as a certain locate technician may press a certain key of the user interface of the marking device and initiate the desired alert acknowledgment such as those shown above in Table . Once the alert acknowledgment is received at operations monitoring application it may be associated with its originating out of tolerance alert and logged in alerts log . Subsequently operations monitoring application continues to monitor the operating conditions of the locating equipment such as marking device . At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step and may optionally proceed to step .

Optionally method may include steps to disable locating equipment until or unless a certain out of tolerance condition is corrected. For example method may optionally include the following steps.

At optional decision step certain out of tolerance conditions may carry such importance that the suspension of marking operations is mandated e.g. disable actuations so as to impede dispensing of markers . One such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to temperature. Another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to humidity. Yet another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to lighting. Still another such out of tolerance condition may be the out of tolerance condition with respect to geo location. Other out of tolerance conditions may also be sufficiently important to mandate suspending marking operations and those examples listed are non limiting. In these examples operations monitoring application may wait a certain amount of time e.g. minute from the initial detection of the out of tolerance conditions and again acquire sensor data to determine whether the out of tolerance condition is still present or has been corrected. If the out of tolerance condition has been corrected method may proceed to step . However if the out of tolerance condition has not been corrected method may proceed to step .

At optional step the locate technician continues to perform marking operations and operations monitoring application continues to monitor the conditions of the marking device. At the conclusion of this step method may for example return to step .

At optional step the marking device may be disabled. For example actuation system of marking device may be disabled so as to impede dispensing of marking material. The action to disable may be logged in alerts log .

At any time during the steps of method the contents of alerts log may be processed by business applications . In one example alerts log may be processed by locate operations scoring application and or ticket approval application for assessing the quality of locate and marking operations that are performed in the field assessing the skill and or competency levels of locate technicians and the like.

While illustrate some non limiting examples of manners in which data provided by environmental sensors and or operational sensors of a marking device may be used other uses are also possible. For example the data from environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used to trigger alerts or notifications to a technician irrespective of whether the sensed condition is outside tolerances. For example in some instances there may not be a specific tolerance for a given environmental or operational condition and yet an alert to the technician may be generated for the purpose of making the technician aware of whatever value the sensed condition has taken. Thus the generation of alerts notifications warnings based on sensed environmental and operational conditions is not limited to those instances in which the sensed condition takes any particular value s . Also as previously explained the notification signal may take any suitable form such as an audible alert a chime a ring tone a verbal message or command e.g. synthesized speech provided by a text to speech synthesizer of the marking device etc. a visual alert e.g. a text display for example in those embodiments in which the marking device includes a display an indicator light etc. a tactile indication any combination of those options or any other suitable type of notification.

Also it should be appreciated that information from one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used more generally to control or alter operation of the marking device. For example one or more components of the marking device or may be activated enabled or disabled or the functionality thereof controlled or altered in some manner in response to one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors providing environmental information and or operational information indicative that such control should be exhibited. Such activation enablement and or disablement may be electrical in nature e.g. providing power or an enable signal triggering operation of a sensor etc. mechanical in nature e.g. causing a locking mechanism to be engaged on the actuation system or both. For example if the surface temperature sensed by surface temperature sensor is outside of acceptable tolerances for dispensing of a marking material such as paint the actuation system may be disabled thus preventing dispensing of a marking material. If the sensed inclination of the marking device as sensed by inclinometer is unsuitable for dispensing of a marking material such as paint the actuation system may be disabled thus preventing dispensing of the marking material. Similarly if the acceleration as sensed by accelerometer is out of tolerance with accepted practices the actuation system may be disabled. If a sensed condition is out of tolerance the operation of one of the environmental and or operational sensors may be altered for example by altering the sampling rate to collect more or less data. According to one embodiment the sampling rate of a location tracking system of the marking device may be increased in response to an out of tolerance heading detected by the compass of the marking device. According to another embodiment the sampling rate of the location tracking system may be increased in response to the location tracking system detecting an out of tolerance location. Other control actions are also possible and the aspects described herein relating to controlling the marking device in response to sensing environmental and or operational conditions are not limited in the types of actions that may be taken or the sensed conditions which may trigger action alteration.

Furthermore the determination of whether a condition or multiple conditions are out of tolerance whether to generate an alert or notification to a technician or whether to control alter some functionality of the marking device based at least in part on environmental and or operational information may be made in any suitable manner. For instance as illustrated in some of the foregoing examples such a determination may be made by comparison of a single value from a sensor to an expected or target value. Alternatively outputs from the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be monitored for changes e.g. any change or by some predetermined amount rather than for a particular single value. For example a change in temperature or a change in light may initiate generation of an alert rather than a single temperature or light value.

In addition information provided by one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be monitored and analyzed to detect patterns. For example information provided by the operational sensors may be used to formulate and assess patterns of operation of a particular technician which may be thought of as technician signatures. As an example a particular technician may have a characteristic motion when performing a marking operation such as painting an arrow on the ground or may perform the operation at a characteristic speed. Assessing information provided by the one or more accelerometers for example may allow for determination of the unique characteristic. Once determined information from the operational sensors on future jobs may allow for identification of the technician based on the unique characteristic and may also be used to assess whether the technician is operating in his her normal manner or whether he she is deviating from his her usual operation which may suggest that the technician was doing something out of the ordinary and which accordingly may cause generation of an alert notification and or alteration of the marking device. Such information therefore may be used for quality control and or for training purposes of technicians. Similarly such operating information from multiple technicians may be used to develop standard operating guidelines or protocols.

It should be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that information provided by two or more of the environmental sensors may be used in combination for example to assess the environmental conditions to interact with the technician e.g. generate an alert and or to control alter operation of the marking device e.g. disable or enable actuation of the marking device . As a non limiting example the sensed ambient temperature in combination with the sensed humidity may provide information about whether a particular form of precipitation is present e.g. snow rain etc. in response to which an alert may be generated and or one or more components of the marking device may be enabled or disabled e.g. the actuation system may be disabled . Non limiting examples of useful combinations of environmentally sensed conditions include ambient temperature humidity surface temperature humidity ambient temperature surface temperature ambient temperature light sensor light image capture light audio capture and ambient temperature humidity light. However it should be appreciated that other combinations are also possible.

It should also be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that information provided by two or more of the operational sensors may be used in combination for example to assess the operational conditions of a marking device to interact with the technician to assess determine and or analyze technician signatures associated with device use manipulation and or to control or alter operation of the marking device e.g. to disable actuation of the marking device enable actuation of the marking device etc. . Non limiting examples of useful combinations of sensed operational conditions which may be used for any of the purposes described above include acceleration of marking device proximity of marking device to surface proximity of marking device to surface inclination of marking device acceleration heading geo location heading acceleration and geo location acceleration inclination. However it should be appreciated that other combinations are also possible.

Furthermore according to one embodiment information provided by one or more environmental sensors may be used in combination with information provided by one or more operational sensors for example to assess the quality of the marking operation to interact with the technician to assess determine and or analyze technician signatures associated with device use manipulation and or to control or alter operation of the marking device e.g. disable or enable actuation of the marking device . For example when dispensing marking material the angle at which the marking dispenser may be suitably held may depend on the surface temperature on which the marking material is being dispensed. Thus information from an inclinometer and a surface temperature sensor of the marking device may be considered in combination to assess whether a technician is performing a marking operation appropriately and may trigger any of the actions described above. Other combinations of sensor information may also be useful depending on a particular application.

As previously explained the marking devices described herein may be used in different modes examples of which include marking mode and landmark mode. In addition marking devices according to one aspect of the present invention may be operated in a so called solo mode or a so called group mode. 

For some marking operations a single technician may be present at the jobsite and may complete the marking operation. Thus any marking data collected relating to the job may be solely from the technician s marking device and may not need to be combined with marking data from any other marking devices. In such situations the marking device may be operated as an individual independent marking device in solo mode. As described above data collected by the marking device may be stored locally and or transmitted to a host server such as remote computer .

For certain types of underground facility locate operations multiple locate technicians may be working on a same locate ticket simultaneously. When this occurs it may be advantageous for some or all of the marking devices that are used during performance of the ticketed job to consolidate data such as by providing data to one of the marking devices or to a host server. This may be accomplished through the use of a group mode of operation of the marking devices. In group mode a marking device may act as a worker device and may not be capable of transmitting its collected marking data to a remote computer. For example the wireless transmission capability of the marking device may be disabled in group mode. Rather the marking data may be cached in local memory of the marking device or may be transmitted to another marking device which may act as a leader device receiving the collected marking data from the other marking devices used for the marking operation. The leader marking device may then transmit the collected marking information to a remote computer or may handle the collected information in any suitable manner.

Selection of solo mode and group mode may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example selection between these two modes may be facilitated by any suitable combination of hardware and or software on the marking device. For example the marking device may include mode controller software for selecting the operating mode of the marking device. According to one embodiment the user interface of the marking device may include a toggle switch for toggling between solo mode and group mode. Alternatively the marking device may present the technician with a menu on a graphical display of user interface from which the technician may choose the desired mode. Other schemes for allowing selection of solo mode and group mode are also possible.

As mentioned previously in some situations it may be desirable to know the location of any marking material dispensed by a marking device. According to some embodiments the location of any dispensed marking material may be approximated by the location of virtually any point on the marking device itself e.g. by acquiring geo location information from a location tracking system coupled to the marking device .

In one exemplary embodiment the accuracy of the dispensing location of marking material may be improved by selecting a point on the marking device sufficiently close to the point from which marking material is dispensed. For example in some implementations the marking material may be dispensed near the tip of the marking device such that determination of the location of the tip of the marking device may provide a sufficiently accurate approximation of the location of the dispensed marking material and therefore a determination of the resulting marking pattern e.g. dots lines arrows lettering etc. . In addition determining the motion of the tip of the marking device may allow for assessment of technician manipulation of the marking device which may be used for quality control training purposes and standard setting among other things.

Thus according to another aspect of the present invention methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of the tip of a marking device. However it should be appreciated that the tip of the marking device is a non limiting example of a specific point of a marking device for which it may be desirable to know the location as for example other portions of the marking device may be closer to the point from which marking material may be dispensed depending on the configuration of the marking device. The methods and apparatus described herein may be applied equally well to the determination of any point of interest on the marking device.

One approach for determining the location of the tip of the marking device e.g. tip shown in or any other point of interest on the marking device is to place a location tracking system at that point. Thus according to one embodiment a marking device such as any of the marking devices described previously herein or any other marking device may include a location tracking system as discussed in other embodiments e.g. a GPS receiver wherein the location tracking system is disposed at or sufficiently near the tip of the marking device allowing for determination of the location of the tip of the marking device. Thus the location tracking system may provide the geo location of the tip of the marking device which as mentioned may be useful for at least two reasons. First because of the close proximity of the location tracking system to the point from which marking material is dispensed the geo location information provided may be used as an indicator of the location of any dispensed marking material. Secondly the geo location information provided by the location tracking system may be used to record the motion of the tip of the marking device which as mentioned may be used for various purposes including detection of out of tolerance operation of the marking device determination of operating patterns of technicians etc.

While the above described embodiment provides a location tracking system positioned at the point of interest on the marking device such positioning of a location tracking system may not always be possible or advantageous. For example as explained previously herein in some embodiments the operation of the location tracking system may be facilitated by positioning the location tracking system toward the top of the marking device for example if the location tracking system is a GPS receiver. However as mentioned it may be desirable in some embodiments to determine the location of the tip of the marking device or any other point of interest of the marking device which in some situations will not correspond to the top of the marking device. Thus according to one embodiment methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of a point of interest of a marking device when a location tracking system is located at a different point on the marking device. For simplicity of explanation the following examples will be discussed assuming that a location tracking system is located near the top of the marking device and that the point of interest of the marking device is the tip of the marking device. It should be appreciated that the described apparatus and techniques may apply equally well to other positions of the location tracking system and points of interest on the marking device.

To facilitate the following discussion it is useful to first consider the physical configuration at issue for determining the location of the tip of the marking device when the location tracking system is located at or near the top of the marking device. For this purpose the marking device may be represented in simplified form as an elongated rod or stick. illustrates a perspective view of such a simplified representation of a marking device shown as marking device .

In the x y plane represents the ground and the z direction represents the vertical direction perpendicular to the ground. The point P may be the location of a location tracking system e.g. a GPS receiver and in some embodiments may correspond generally to the top of the marking device for example near where the technician may hold the marking device if it is a handheld device. The point P represents the point of interest of the marking device and in this non limiting example corresponds generally to the tip of the marking device. The point P may be assumed to be at ground level i.e. in the x y plane z 0 for purposes of simplicity except as described below in those embodiments in which the distance of P from the x y plane may be measured. The shortest distance between P and P is given by L which in some embodiments may correspond to the length of the marking device although not all embodiments are limited in this respect. For example if the marking device has a non linear shape the distance L may not correspond to the length of the marking device. The marking device may be projected onto the x y plane z 0 along the dashed line which therefore lies in the x y plane. The distance between the points P and P in the x y plane i.e. along the dashed line is represented by d. The distance between the point P and ground is given by H i.e. z H . At any given time the marking device may make an angle with respect to the x y plane i.e. with respect to ground in this non limiting example. The projection of the marking device on the x y plane i.e. along the line may be at an angle in the x y plane with respect to the x axis. In some embodiments the x axis may be defined to align with true North although not all embodiments are limited in this respect.

According to one embodiment a marking device such as marking device may comprise a location tracking system at the point P. The location tracking system may provide the geo location of the point P with respect to the x y plane represented as GPS. The geo location of P in the x y plane may be represented by GPS . As will be explained GPS may be determined based on a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and determination of suitable combinations of L d H and . The value of L may be known before the marking operation begins for example since it may be set after manufacture of the marking device. The values of d H and may be directly sensed during operation of the marking device or may be calculated using suitable ones of the operational sensors as will be described below.

According to one embodiment the geo location of the tip of a marking device such as marking device may be determined using the value of GPSgiven by the location tracking system at P and accelerometer data from an accelerometer positioned at or sufficiently near the tip of the marking device i.e. at point P in . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The accelerometer in this non limiting embodiment is a 3 axis accelerometer. By suitable analysis of the acceleration values for each axis using known algorithms the angle that the marking device makes with the ground may be determined see e.g. the previous discussion of how to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer as described by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Based on the known distance L and the determined angle the distance d between GPSand GPS in the x y plane may be calculated using the fact that the cosine of is equal to d L .

Once the distance d is known the value of GPS may be derived from GPSif the angle is known since may provide the direction from GPSto GPS again in some embodiments the x axis may be aligned with or taken as true North such that may represent an angle with respect to true North . The value of cp may be determined in one of several manners. One manner for determining is from the readout of a compass of the marking device such as previously described compass . If the location tracking system providing GPSis a GPS receiver then the value of may alternatively be taken from the heading information provided as part of the NMEA data stream provided by the GPS receiver. A third alternative for determining cp is to calculate a direction of motion based on multiple GPS points taken from the location tracking system. According to this third alternative multiple GPS points taken at different times may be used to calculate a direction of motion by for example determining the direction indicated by a straight line connecting the multiple GPS points. Other methods for determining are also possible as these are non limiting examples. Once is known the value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and . Once GPS is determined it may be used instead of GPS or in addition to GPS as more accurate geo location data which may be included for example in one or more event entries and or electronic records as discussed above.

According to an alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing an inclinometer on the marking device such as inclinometer previously described. The inclinometer may provide the value of . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. Thus the value of d may be determined using L and as explained above. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and as noted above.

According to another embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing a proximity sensor such as previously described proximity sensor . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The proximity sensor may be positioned at P and configured to measure the value of H. Assuming that the point P is at or very near the ground i.e. having a vertical height of approximately zero the value of H and the known distance L of the marking device may be used to determine d for example using the Pythagorean theorem. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

As explained the above described example in which a single proximity sensor is used to determine the value of H may provide suitable results when it is assumed that the point P has zero vertical height. In one embodiment that assumption may be avoided by also including a proximity sensor at the point P and configured to measure the distance between P and the ground. Then the difference in height between P and P rather than the value of H may be used in connection with the known distance L to determine the distance d e.g. using the Pythagorean Theorem . The value of cp may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

According to a further alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing two 3 axis accelerometers on the marking device. One accelerometer may be located at the point P on the marking device while the second may be located at the point P. Using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety the location of P relative to P may be determined.

As mentioned in some instances it may be desirable to track the motion of a specific portion of a marking device such as the tip of the marking device for any one of the reasons previously described. In those embodiments in which the marking device includes a location tracking system providing a value of GPSfor a different point on the marking device than the point of interest the tracking of the point of interest may be performed by determining GPS the location of the point of interest for each value of GPSas the marking device is moved using any of the above described techniques.

However in some instances the value of GPSprovided by the location tracking system may not have sufficient accuracy to allow for a desired level of accuracy in tracking the motion at the desired point on the marking device e.g. the point P . For example when performing a marking operation a technician may make marking patterns that are relatively small compared to the resolution of the location tracking system. For example the technician may make lines arrows write words or make other patterns that have details smaller than the resolution of the location tracking system e.g. smaller than approximately 30 inches in some embodiments . In such instances using the above described techniques for determining GPS as the point P moves may not sufficiently capture the movement with a desired resolution. Thus the techniques described below may be used.

According to one embodiment the motion of the point P may be tracked by using any of the above described techniques to get an initial value of GPS and then using data from an accelerometer at the point P to determine the distance traveled in the x and y directions. This technique is commonly referred to in the relevant arts as dead reckoning. In this embodiment the accelerometer may provide acceleration data for the x and y axes. That data may be integrated twice to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions thus giving the position of P at any point in time relative to any initial GPS value. Alternatively the accelerometer may output velocity data for each axis which may be integrated to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions. A specific example is now described with respect to .

The making of the marking pattern by a marking device may be determined as follows. First the technician may begin the marking pattern at the point R at which time the technician actuates the actuation system to begin dispensing marking material. The location of point R may correspond to the initial location of the tip of the marking device and therefore may be determined from a value of GPSof the top of the marking device and any of the above described techniques for determining the location of the tip relative to the location of the top of the marking device.

The technician may then begin to move the marking device along the path indicated by line ending at the point R. The motion of the tip of the marking device along line may be determined from the output of an accelerometer at the tip of the marking device providing an output signal for both the x and y directions. According to one embodiment the output of the accelerometer is velocity data for both the x and y axes and is output periodically for example twice per second although higher and lower data output rates are possible. The velocity values for each of the x and y axes may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer e.g. one half of a second in this non limiting example to get the distance traveled in the x and y directions from the initial point R. Alternatively the total velocity of the marking device may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer and the direction of motion may be determined by comparing the velocity values for the x and y axes to each other e.g. by taking the ratio of the velocity along the x axis to the velocity along the y axis. Either way the distance travelled in the x and y directions may be determined.

In the non limiting example of the first line painted by the technician i.e. line may serve as a base line or reference line from which the angle of subsequent motions may be referenced. Thus in the angle of the second motion of the technician from points R to R along the path indicated by line may be determined by reference to the direction of line since the accelerometer output will indicate a change from the motion along the path of line . The distance and direction of the line may be determined as described above for line . Again the line is shown as a dashed line as the actuation system of the marking device is not activated while the marking device traverses the illustrated path.

The marking device is subsequently moved along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R along line from point R to R along line from point R to R and finally along line from point R back to point R . The length and relative direction of each of the indicated lines may be determined as described above for line

Thus it should be appreciated that according to this non limiting embodiment a value of GPSprovided by a location tracking system is used only to determine the initial location of R after which the locations of points R R are determined using dead reckoning.

Also it should be appreciated that while the relative orientation of each of the indicated lines is determined from the dead reckoning techniques described the absolute or actual orientation is not determined from the accelerometer data since the actual orientation of line is not determined from the accelerometer data. Thus according to one embodiment an additional step of determining an actual orientation of the line may be performed. According to one non limiting embodiment the actual orientation of line may be given by a heading provided by a compass of the marking device while the line is made. Other techniques may alternatively be used to determine the actual direction of the first motion of the marking pattern.

According to the above described embodiment the location of the tip of a marking device may be determined by determining an initial location using a location tracking system and subsequently using the dead reckoning techniques described. Because the error associated with dead reckoning may increase as the distance traversed increases it may be desirable in some embodiments to reset the dead reckoning by determining a new initial location value using a location tracking system. For example referring to the marking pattern in one embodiment the location of R may be determined from a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and any of the techniques described for determining a value of GPS for the given GPS. Subsequently dead reckoning may be used to determine the paths of lines and . According to one embodiment the location of point R is not determined from dead reckoning but rather may be determined by getting a value of GPSat the point R and calculating a corresponding value of GPS . Then dead reckoning may be used to determine the locations of lines . In this manner location errors that accumulate using dead reckoning may be minimized or eliminated.

Accordingly it should be understood that a new initial location point serving as a starting point for the use of dead reckoning may be set at any suitable intervals during a marking operation. Suitable criteria for determining when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning include setting a new initial point for the beginning of each new mark that a technician makes e.g. each new line arrow letter etc. for each new marking pattern e.g. a dotting pattern a lines pattern etc. for each new marking job or every time the dead reckoning data indicates a threshold total distance has been traveled e.g. 5 meters 10 meters 50 meters or any other threshold value . This list is not exhaustive as other criteria may also be used to determine when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning.

According to one aspect of the present invention a marking device may include an enhanced user interface with tactile functionality. As will be described the tactile functionality may be provided in one or more of various locations on the marking device and may be used for various purposes.

The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the handle of the marking device or otherwise mechanically coupled to the handle . The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the joystick or is otherwise mechanically coupled to the joystick . The tactile indicator is disposed within or on the actuator or otherwise mechanically coupled to the actuator . It should be appreciated that marking devices including tactile indicators according to the embodiments described herein are not limited to having any particular number of tactile indicators i.e. one or more and are not limited in the locations at which the tactile indicators are placed.

The tactile indicators may be of any suitable type. One example of a suitable type of tactile indicator is that used in cellular telephones to provide the vibrate functionality. According to one embodiment one or more of the tactile indicators is formed by a flywheel that has a weight configured to unbalance the flywheel so that when the flywheel spins it wobbles. According to one embodiment all three of the tactile indicators are the same type although not all embodiments are limited in this respect.

The tactile indicators may provide any suitable type of tactile indication to a technician in terms of duration frequency intensity pattern and any combinations thereof. Also the tactile indicators need not provide the same type of tactile indication. For example tactile indicator may provide a relatively strong continuous vibration of long duration whereas tactile indicator may provide a series of low intensity short vibrations. Furthermore one or more of the tactile indicators may be configurable to provide multiple different types of tactile indications. For example in some instances the tactile indicator may provide a long continuous vibration whereas in other instances the tactile indicator may provide a short vibration. Thus the type s of tactile indication presented by the tactile indicators is not limiting.

According to one embodiment the tactile indications provided to a user may have different meanings. According to one embodiment the meaning may differ depending on the tactile indicator providing the tactile indication. For example vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate the marking device power supply is low while vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate the technician has tried to select an invalid entry for a menu displayed on display and vibration of the tactile indicator may indicate that the actuator is not functioning. According to one embodiment different meanings may be conveyed by a single tactile indicator. For example a short vibration of tactile indicator may indicate the marking device power supply is low while a longer duration vibration of tactile indicator may indicate for example that the marking device is not at the correct job location for example as may be determined by a location tracking system of the marking device. Thus it should be appreciated that the tactile indicators may be used to convey various messages to the technician.

According to one aspect of the present invention one or more of the tactile indicators may operate in response to information collected by an environmental sensor and or operational sensor of the marking device. For example as described above e.g. in connection with some embodiments of the present invention provide an alert or notification to the marking device technician if an out of tolerance condition is detected based on a condition sensed by an environmental or operational sensor. As explained the alerts may take any suitable form including visual and or audible. In addition or alternatively the alerts may be presented via one or more of the tactile indicators. For example the tactile indicator may vibrate if an out of tolerance condition is detected that would be adverse to dispensing of a marking material and therefore adverse to operation of the actuator .

According to one embodiment the nature of operation of each of the tactile indicators in in terms of what triggers vibration of the tactile indicator the type of vibration intensity duration frequency pattern etc. and the meaning may be controlled by the control electronics . For example the nature of operation of each of the tactile indicators may be programmed into a processor of the control electronics e.g. similar to processor previously described .

In one example the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator may be associated with the general operation of marking device and or aspects of the marking operations. In other words conditions associated with the general operation of marking device and or aspects of the marking operations are communicated to the user via tactile sensations at handle . In this example tactile sensations provided at handle may be used to indicate any events that may occur on and or any conditions of the marking device. Examples of tactile sensations that are provided at handle by tactile indicator may include but are not limited to the following 

In one embodiment the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator at the joystick may be associated with user interface functions. In other words when the user is using the joystick or buttons to navigate through menus on display tactile feedback to the user at the joystick may be used to communicate for example a validation of certain selections or user interface functions. Examples of tactile sensations that may be provided at joystick via tactile indicator may include but are not limited to the following 

In one embodiment the tactile sensations programmed for tactile indicator at actuator may be associated with the process of dispensing marking material. In other words conditions associated with dispensing marking material from a marking dispenser may be communicated to the user via tactile sensations at actuator . Examples of tactile sensations that may be provided at actuator via tactile indicator may include but are not limited to the following 

Tactile sensations may also be generated based on information received from one or more sources external to the marking device such as but not limited to external systems external networks external computing devices external business applications and external instrumentation among others. For example the marking device e.g. marking device may be in communication with one or more external devices such as remote computer via a network. The network may be for example a local area network LAN and or a wide area network WAN . The control electronics may be programmed to generate tactile sensations via one or more of tactile indicators based on information received from the remote computer .

Thus further examples of scenarios which may trigger generation of a tactile sensation via any one or more of the tactile indicators may include but are not limited to the following 

It should be appreciated that information about the generation of a tactile signal may be included in an electronic record a message or any other source of information including the other marking information described herein. For example information about whether a tactile signal was generated which tactile indicator generated the signal the type of signal e.g. duration frequency intensity etc. the cause of the signal the time of the signal e.g. from a timestamp and or the geo location at which the signal was issued may be recorded among other things.

Table 22 illustrates an example of an event entry that may be made in response to actuation of an actuation system of a marking device in which the marking device includes a tactile indicator. The illustrated event entry is similar to that of Table 15 shown and described previously with the addition of an indication of whether a tactile signal was generated e.g. a yes or no indication being represented by Y and N for TCTL . As in Table 15 for purposes of this event format the actuator is deemed to have three possible states i.e. PRESSED HELD and RELEASED. Marking information from one or more input devices other components of the marking device is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

Table 23 illustrates an example of a data record that may be generated by a marking device including a tactile indicator as well as various environmental and operational sensors. As shown the data record may include a yes no indication of whether a tactile signal was generated as well as information about the type of signal. It should be appreciated that other forms for the data are possible and that other information regarding the tactile indicator may be included such as any of the types of information described above.

In those embodiments in which a marking device includes both a tactile indicator and at least one accelerometer data from the accelerometer s may be used to verify whether a tactile indication was generated as the accelerometer data may reflect any physical movement of the marking device including the physical vibrations caused by a tactile indicator. Thus referring again to Table 23 for example the acceleration data may provide verification that the indicated tactile signal was in fact generated.

It should be appreciated that many of the aspects of the present invention described above also apply to a combination locate and marking device. As explained a locate receiver is a device typically used to locate an underground facility after which the location may be marked using a marking device of the types described herein. According to one embodiment a single device may perform the function of a locate receiver and a marking device and thus may be a combination locate and marking device as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 569 192 filed on Sep. 29 2009 and titled Methods Apparatus and Systems For Generating Electronic Records Of Locate And Marking Operations And Combined Locate And Marking Apparatus For Same which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The various aspects described herein relating to marking devices may also apply to such combination locate and marking devices as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 569 192.

The data of interest that may be acquired and analyzed may include but is not limited to t timestamp data t timestamp data geo location information of physical locate marks geo location information of environmental landmarks direction information any information included in the standard data stream of the locate tracking system e.g. GPS system color type of marking material amount of marking material in marking dispenser serial number of marking dispenser e.g. barcode RFID ID information e.g. individual vehicle wage and or hour compliance battery status of the marking device angle of spray of marking material e.g. using an inclinometer wired wireless connection status Bluetooth signal strength storage capacity of the local memory temperature humidity light level movement of the marking device mode of operation of the marking device docking state of the marking device e.g. docked undocked charging not charging alerts against expectations in performance e.g. compare amount and or type of marking material sprayed against facility maps and any combination thereof.

The information such as shown in various tables herein that may be acquired by use of the data acquisition system and methods described herein may be used for any purpose. In an embodiment the information of the data acquisition system may be analyzed against expected marking operations in order to gain benefits in for example operating efficiency personnel management inventory management quality control training operations safety customer satisfaction and the like.

Additionally the information that is acquired by use of the data acquisition system and the methods of the present disclosure may be correlated to other aspects of locate and marking operations. For example the marking device data streams e.g. respective event entries or one or more electronic records transmitted by the marking device may be correlated to other data streams of multiple marking devices or any other devices in order to aggregate assess evaluate draw insights from take action on this information and any combination thereof. Correlating disparate data streams may be useful in order to better interpret and or gain new interpretations that are useful. For example by analyzing the aggregated data field service providers may gain visibility into the distributed workforce may take corrective and or any other constructive action to improve process management may improve and or develop best practices and any combination thereof. In an embodiment certain trends may be identified by correlating historical records of the amount of time that is spent performing locate and marking operations to other information such as but not limited to the time of day time of year address of the locate site experience of the locate technician weather conditions heavy or light traffic times and the like.
