The specification relates generally to data management and specifically to a method system and apparatus for managing and augmenting contact data based on chronological contextual semantic and other attributes.

Modern travel and communications technology have led to an increasingly interconnected global population. As a result any given individual may have contact with a significant number of others in various locations and for various reasons. Tracking and determining the relative relevance of an ever increasing number of such contacts as well as the increasing volume of data available in connection with each contact presents various technical challenges.

It will be understood that when link is wireless link can also include any base stations and backhaul links necessary to connect client device to network . It will be understood that communications interface can therefore be selected for compatibility with link as well as with network .

Client device also includes an input device interconnected with processor . In general input device is configured to receive input such as key presses and provide input data representative of that input to processor . Input device can thus include any suitable combination of a mouse a keyboard a microphone a touch screen and the like. In embodiments where input device includes a touch screen the touch screen can be integrated with a display described below in further detail.

It will now be apparent that display can include a flat panel display e.g. Liquid Crystal Display LCD plasma and the like a Cathode Ray Tube CRT and the like. Circuitry can thus include any suitable combination of display buffers transistors electron beam controllers LCD cells plasma cells phosphors and the like.

The various components of client device are interconnected for example via a communication bus not shown . Client device can be powered by mains electricity or a battery not shown or a combination thereof.

System also includes a plurality of servers and so on referred to collectively as servers and generically as a server . Each server can be based on any known server environment. As such each server includes one or more processors volatile e.g. Random Access Memory RAM and or non volatile e.g. read only memory ROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM flash memory magnetic computer storage device or optical disc memories and one or more communications interfaces for interconnecting with network via links . Links can be for example wired links. Servers can be managed by way of input and output devices not shown such as keyboards and displays. Such input and output devices can be co located with servers or can be located at terminals not shown remote from servers and connected to servers via network .

As will be discussed in greater detail below each server can be a remote source of contact data for computing device . For example server can be a server hosting a social networking application such as Twitter Facebook or Linkedin . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the noted social networking sites are merely indicative of a growing number of social network sites many of which are segmented by interest and location a non exhaustive list of which are maintained by Wikipedia at the URL http en.wikipedia.org wiki List of social networking websites. By way of further example server can be a server hosting webmail services such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail or Hotmail as well as server based mail services such as Microsoft Outlook which allow users to maintain address books. Server can include messaging or communication services including instant messaging services such as Windows Live Messenger Yahoo Messenger or Google Talk as well as communication services such as Skype or Google Voice. A wide variety of other remote sources of contact data will occur to those skilled in the art. In general computing device and client device can interact with servers and obtain data from servers via network and the relevant ones of links and . Client device can interact with servers for example through a web browser interface provided by a browser application maintained by client device . Computing device can interact with servers via Application Programming Interface API calls transmitted by computing device .

As will be discussed in further detail below client device can maintain in memory a plurality of applications each comprising computer readable instructions executable by processor . Such applications can include a web browser application and a contact agent client application also referred to herein as contact agent client and client application .

Computing device can also maintain in memory a plurality of applications each comprising computer readable instructions executable by processor . Among those applications can be a contact agent host application also referred to herein as contact agent host and host application . In general computing device can be configured via execution of contact agent host by processor to aggregate contact data from various sources including one or more of servers as well as client device to analyze the aggregated data and store the resulting analyzed data and to perform actions based on the analyzed data. The term contact data is used herein in a broad sense to indicate data relating to contacts i.e. individuals or other legal entities such as corporations . Contact data can thus include any data which describes such contacts is published by or in connection with contacts relates to messages and events in which contacts are involved results from the activities of contacts e.g. the execution of applications by contacts and the like. The analyzed data can include attributes defining contact records i.e. name and address information for contacts and other attributes associated with the contact records. Such attributes will be discussed in greater detail below and can include for example chronological contextual and semantic attributes.

Referring now to a schematic block diagram of certain components of contact agent host is depicted. It will now be apparent that each element of contact agent host depicted in and discussed below can be embodied within the computer readable instructions that comprise contact agent host . In other words functionality described below as being carried out by a certain module of contact agent host is performed by processor as configured via the execution of contact agent host . Contact agent host can thus include a data layer responsible for interactions with data sources such as servers . Data layer also manages the storage of contact data and analyzed data. Examples of analyzed data are shown in the form of contacts events and attributes . It will be appreciated that while contacts and attributes both contain attributes as discussed earlier contacts can contain those attributes which define contact records such as names and address information for various entities. Analyzed data can also include messages not shown retrieved from contact data. Such messages can include text video voice messages and the like or any suitable combination thereof. It will now be apparent that although contacts events and attributes are shown as being maintained separately any suitable storage and indexing scheme can be used to maintain analyzed contact data.

Contact agent host can also include a logic layer . Logic layer can include an account management module a contact mapping module a matching module a pattern discovery module a keyword analysis module a proximity detection module and a search module . The functions of the various exemplary modules of logic layer will be discussed below in greater detail.

The account management module manages data in memory associated with each source of contact data. The data maintained by account management module includes but is not limited to one or more account identifiers log in names or other values required to access and retrieve contact data from a given source of contact data though it is contemplated that some sources of contact data may be publicly accessible and thus do not require authentication . Such account management data can also include any other prescribed information pertaining to how or when to access a source of contact data for example whether to access a source of contact data at a specified time periodically or when the source is explicitly accessed in some other context . The account management module can access contact data sources based on the stored data described above. Account management module can maintain the above described account management data for each client device associated with computing device . Account management data along with all other monitoring and notification related configurable settings can be managed from computing device e.g. by way of terminal or client device e.g. via a web browser interface . Account management module can also acquire and manage data pertaining to any prescribed preferences associated with contact agent client as well as preferences used by other modules in logic layer .

Contact mapping module determines geographic coordinates associated with a given contact record and transmits such coordinates to client device for use at client device for example by a web based or local mapping application e.g. Google Maps or Bing Maps based on a given prescribed location e.g. greater San Francisco area postal code province state country or the present location of the client device . Location information can be derived and supplied to client device via a number of means including but not limited to being explicitly provided or set by a given contact or being autonomously determined by a variety of means such as reverse geocoding IP addresses or methods used by cellular networks to triangulate devices. Contact mapping module can select contacts for which to obtain and transmit location data to client device based on contact attributes such as professional or personal affiliations e.g. Optical Networking or Scotch Tasting as well as contextual attributes interested in meeting for dinner .

Matching module parses filters and indexes retrieved contact data retrieved from for example servers . Parsing includes lexical and syntactic analysis of retrieved contact data in order to derive objects or tokens also referred to herein as attributes such as name location telephone number state e.g. available busy in transit attending conference etc. intent e.g. travelling to Los Angeles in two weeks and the like. Matching module includes a filtering function which is configured to discard contact data that is deemed to be irrelevant to merge duplicate contact data or any suitable combination of such functions. The filtering function can be set to discard contact data that does not relate to a particular selection of attributes. In other embodiments the filtering function can be set to discard contact data that does relate to a particular selection of attributes. Such selections can be altered via input data received from terminal or client device . Such selections can also be altered automatically at computing device based on chronological spatial or contextual information.

Matching module also includes an indexing function configured to identify portions of retrieved contact data deemed to be of particular interest based on certain attributes. Portions of contact data identified as being relevant to certain attributes can be processed and stored as analyzed data and can include for example data describing events or other attributes. The attributes which are used to determine whether the portions of contact data are of interest can be explicitly set via terminal or client device and can include for example attributes such as professional affiliation location and the like. Such attributes can also be determined automatically by matching module for example by the relative frequency with which they are derived from retrieved contact data e.g. an increased instance of contact data pertaining to the attribute venture capital can lead to retaining portions of retrieved contact data relevant to that attribute . A combination of explicitly set attributes and automatic determination can also be used. It is contemplated that a variety of algorithms e.g. expert systems neural net based systems inference engines and data structures can be used to implement the above mentioned functions of matching module . It is also contemplated that multiple parsing filtering identification and indexing methods can be used in parallel or as a function of the source of the contact data.

Pattern discovery module correlates analyzed contact data to infer potential items of interest based on relative frequency over a given chronological period i.e. the frequency with which a particular attribute appears in analyzed contact data threshold events or based on explicitly prescribed attributes. It is contemplated that a variety of available algorithms can be used to implement pattern recognition functionality. It is also contemplated that multiple pattern recognition methods can be used in parallel or as a function of the source of the contact data.

Keyword analysis module selects analyzed contact data as being of interest based on specific keywords e.g. Information Technology by invoking the functionality of matching module and pattern discovery module . The keywords can be explicitly prescribed via the account management module or automatically determined based on the relative frequency with which they appear in contact data gathered from servers and client device over a given chronological period or other threshold events. Keyword analysis module can optionally synthesize a summary of relevant portions of analyzed contact data which can be pushed or otherwise provided to client device for display on display or to any other designated location e.g. a messaging system or e mail address or retrieved upon request as will be discussed below in connection with the performance of block of method .

The proximity detection module determines the relative geographic location of contacts of interest. Contacts of interest can be explicitly prescribed via the account management module by selection of attributes describing those contacts e.g. names such as John Smith and professional affiliations such as Cisco or Professional Engineers of Ontario and other attributes qualifying those contacts e.g. an attribute indicating that the status of the contact is available . Contacts of interest can also be determined as described below in connection with the method of . Proximity detection module can optionally invoke contact mapping module to retrieve geographical information. The geography of interest can be set by the account management module and can include geo political boundaries e.g. state country or simple geometric search criteria e.g. within 10 kilometers .

The search module selects analyzed contact data as being of interest based on various keywords e.g. marketing by invoking matching module and pattern discovery module . Search module can synthesize a summary of selected analyzed contact data deemed to be relevant. The summary can be pushed or otherwise provided to client device or another designated location as described above in relation to keyword analysis module . While keyword analysis module selects analyzed data based on keywords either explicitly prescribed or received in contact data from particular sources for example servers and client device search module can select analyzed contact data of interest based on keywords from a wider selection of unregistered sources. Search module can be configured substantially as a web crawler for example. The operation of search module is configurable and operational parameters for search module can be maintained by and updated via account management module . Configurable operational parameters for search module can include for example periods of activity e.g. constant operation operation during certain hours only and the like target selection e.g. exclude certain potential sources such as web domains include only sources in certain categories acceptable network conditions e.g. operate only when certain quality of service parameters can be satisfied and the like.

Although the above mentioned modules are described individually it is contemplated that the functionality of any given selection of modules or of all modules can be combined within logic layer .

Contact agent host also includes an API layer . API layer enables interaction between the data and logic layers and and a presentation layer of contact agent host . Although not shown in API layer also enables interaction between data layer and the data sources discussed above. Presentation layer can include various modules for interacting with client device . For example presentation layer can include a website module for example hosted by computing device for enabling interactions with browser application of client device . API layer also enables applications maintained at client device to make API calls directly to computing device . In particular contact agent client is depicted schematically in . Contact agent client can include any suitable combination of a browser plugin a mobile application where client device is for example a mobile phone an email plugin integrated with an email client application and a desktop application where client device is a personal computer or laptop computer . The various modules of contact agent client can interact with computing device via API layer .

Referring now to a method of managing and augmenting contact data will be described in conjunction with its performance in system . It will be appreciated however that method need not be performed exactly as discussed herein and can be performed on systems other than system .

Beginning at block processor can be configured via execution of contact agent host and in particular account management module of contact agent host to register one or more data sources. Data sources can include the services or applications hosted by servers as well as sources local to client device such as an address book maintained in memory . In some embodiments computing device can maintain copies of client data e.g. address books for backup purposes as well as for ready access during performance of method . Data source registration can include receiving input data from client device or terminal defining various parameters for each data source. For example where a data source implements authentication block can include the receipt of login identification and a password or any other required authentication information. Other data can also be maintained for each registered data source such as a network address for the data source an identification of the necessary API call required to request data from that source or any suitable combination of the above. Each registered data source can be maintained as a record in a data sources database not shown stored in memory . It will be appreciated that some or all of the data collected during the performance of block can be encrypted.

As indicated by the dashed arrow returning to block performance of block can be repeated as necessary until all the desired data sources have been registered. It will be appreciated that block can also be performed at any other time during the performance of method . Performance of block can be initiated at any time by receipt of input data indicating selection of a add data source command in a GUI provided by terminal . In some embodiments performance of block can be initiated by receipt of an API call at computing device from client device . Such an API call can be generated by client device responsive to selection of a command in a GUI provided on display .

Proceeding to block processor can be configured to request contact data from at least one of the registered data sources. In some embodiments processor can be configured to request data from every data source. Performance of block includes the transmission of a request via communications interface and network to each server which has been registered as a data source. For data sources maintained by computing device itself performance of block can also include transmission of a request to for example another application that is other than contact agent host resident on computing device including but not limited to social networking applications instant messaging applications or e mail applications in addition to single execution source applications such as on demand content management systems. For data sources maintained by client device performance of block can include transmission of a request to client device via network .

Method continues at block at which contact data is received responsive to the requests transmitted at block . Block can therefore include the receipt of data from servers client device and any local data sources as applicable. Contact data received at block can be maintained in memory in a data store shown in . Contact data can also be received at block from a different data store within memory similar to data store but associated with a different client device . In other words computing device can perform method for a plurality of client devices and in some embodiments can use contact data gathered for one client device in an analysis performed for another client device.

It is also contemplated that in some embodiments contact data can be received by computing device at block without having transmitted a request for that contact data i.e. unsolicited contact data . Transmission of such unsolicited contact data can originate at client device and can be initiated for example by receipt of input data from input device at processor . More specifically as mentioned above client device can maintain in memory for execution by processor contact agent client . Processor can be configured via execution of contact agent client to control display to generate a representation of a GUI also referred to herein as an interface including selectable commands. An example of such an interface is shown in .

Contact data can be provided to processor via input device by selection of scratchpad followed by data entry. Such data can take a variety of forms. For example data can be copied and pasted from a document into scratchpad . Input data received at processor in connection with scratchpad can be transmitted to computing device for receipt at block . Such transmission can be initiated by selection of a transmit command not shown at client device . In other non limiting embodiments such transmission can be carried out automatically at configurable intervals.

Once contact data has been received at block method proceeds to block at which processor can be configured to begin analysis of the aggregated contact data maintained in data store . The analysis can be performed by processor via execution of the various modules of contact agent host including at least matching module . In other words matching module distills attributes and other analyzed data from the raw contact data received at block . Performance of block includes indexing the received contact data in data store . The indexed contact data is then traversed and attributes are identified from the indexed contact data. A wide variety of attributes can be identified in various categories. Attributes can describe a contact e.g. the name and address of an individual birth date gender and the like . Other attributes can describe geographic data such as the location of a contact s employer and the like.

Attributes can also generally illustrate the context with which a contact is associated. For example processor can distill the name of a contact and the received contact data can indicate that the contact publishes articles in information technology IT . Processor can thus select the attribute IT for association with the name attribute of that contact. It will now be apparent that a wide variety of attributes can be ascertained from the contact data in data store . Such attributes can also be associated with one another. For example a name attribute and a location attribute can be associated when they were derived from the same portion of contact data received at block . It is not necessary for contextual or geographical attributes to be associated solely with name attributes however. For example some attributes which describe context such as IT above can be associated with other attributes which frequently appear in similar contexts such as hardware for example .

Performance of block also includes the selection of portions of contact data such as data describing an event for storage along with the identified attributes.

Processor can also as part of the performance of block assign a weighting factor to one or more of the attributes distilled from data store for each contact. Weighting factors can be assigned to indicate the relative importance of each attribute. For example the above mentioned contact who publishes IT articles could also maintain a gardening website which is identified in the received contact data. Assume that the IT articles were significantly more prevalent that is the articles or mentions thereof appeared more frequently in data store than the gardening related writings the IT attribute could be assigned a higher weighting than a gardening attribute. Weighting factors can also be specified or modified explicitly based on contextual or other attributes. For example weights associated with specific geographic attributes identifying locations such as Cancun can be more strongly weighted towards recreational attributes such as scuba . Those skilled in the art will recognize that weighting factors can be assigned and modified via a variety of methods and algorithms in the art including methods associated with neural networking expert systems and inference engines as well as methods and algorithms practiced in information theory and computer science based on algebraic operations based on relative frequency distance e.g. word separation and explicitly defined importance.

Performance of block can also include storing and indexing the results of the analysis i.e. attributes in memory . As will now be apparent to those skilled in the art any suitable indexing scheme can be used to facilitate searching and access of the attributes and other analyzed data and to indicate associations therebetween. In general analyzed data including attributes distilled from data store as a result of the performance of block can be maintained in memory in a processed data store . Following completion of block data store can be cleared though this is not a necessity in some embodiments some or all of the contents of data store can be retained for archiving purposes or to allow for further processing either at a later time or simultaneously with the remainder of the performance of method as a background process.

Following completion of the performance of block method advances to block . It is contemplated that as shown by the dashed arrow returning from block to block the data gathering and analysis embodied by the performance of blocks can be repeated at any time independently of the remainder of method . In some embodiments performance of blocks can be initiated automatically by contact agent host . Such automatic initiation can be based on a predefined time period. In other non limiting embodiments automatic initiation could instead be based on network conditions. That is processor could be configured to initiate retrieval and analysis of data only when certain cost bandwidth or other network parameters are satisfied. In still other non limiting embodiments initiation of the performance of blocks can be manual via input received at terminal .

Returning to at block processor can be configured to monitor activities on client device and terminal . In particular processor can be configured via execution of contact agent host to monitor input data received at terminal and to monitor various activities at client device as discussed in greater detail below. Performance of block can also include requesting and gathering data considered to be input in the context of block from unregistered sources by search module . It is also contemplated that data received from registered sources such as servers can be considered input at block . Further data collected in connection with other client devices can also be considered as input at block . In general the performance of method can be continuous and thus contact data received for analysis can also be treated as input and processed in light of previously stored analyzed data.

It is contemplated that in some embodiments processor of client device is configured via execution of contact agent client to carry out local monitoring and to transmit the results of such local monitoring to computing device . Thus in performing block processor of computing device monitors for i.e. waits for receipt of local monitoring results from client device .

Referring to local monitoring at client device can be configured via selection of the Monitoring command by way of input device . Local monitoring and transmission of results can be conducted at any suitable time interval and the level of detail of such local monitoring can also be configured. In some embodiments it may be desirable to minimize the impact of contact agent client on the performance of client device and thus the time interval and detail settings can be changed to reduce the frequency of monitoring and the volume of monitored data that is collected for transmission to computing device . In other embodiments due to the requirements for increased data quality the increased capabilities of client device or both performance impact may be of lesser concern and thus the frequency and detail level of monitoring can be increased. Those skilled in the art will recognise that the local monitoring can be configured to execute as a background process on client device and configured to change state to a foreground process upon an explicit command or upon the detection of a given event.

As part of the local monitoring contact agent client can be configured to monitor any of a variety of applications executing on client device such as web browser a word processing application a messaging application such as an email client and the like. In some embodiments local monitoring includes the recording of input data received from input device and of representations generated by display for transmission to computing device . That is in such embodiments client device simply collects raw data in the form of input data and screen captures of display and transmits the collected data to computing device for analysis.

In other embodiments client device can perform varying degrees of data pre processing prior to transmitting data to computing device . In these embodiments processor can be configured to distill a smaller number of keywords from input data received from input device it is contemplated that when no pre processing is conducted all items of data are considered keywords for transmission to computing device . For example processor can be configured to monitor a word processing application and discard prepositions punctuation marks pronouns and the like received as input data. The remaining words received as input data can be considered keywords and transmitted to computing device . Processor can also be configured rather than transmitting screen captures of display to distill keywords for transmission while discarding other portions of the screen captures. It is contemplated that keywords in the context of screen captures also includes image data. Thus processor can be configured to transmit a photograph and associated caption displayed on display but not a background image or wallpaper which can be considered to be of lesser or negligible importance.

Input data can be received specifying which applications are to be monitored at what frequency and at what level of detail including the level of pre processing to be carried out in an interface not shown generated upon selection of the Applications command in interface . Such settings can then be maintained in memory . Interactions monitoring and otherwise as will be discussed below in greater detail with the various applications can be managed by processor executing contact agent and in particular the plugins such as and of presentation layer . Contact agent can autonomously derive and infer attributes and relationships pertaining to contact information via the matching module pattern matching module and other modules of the logic layer .

In addition to the local monitoring mentioned above local monitoring also includes monitoring input data received at processor from input device in connection with contact agent client itself. In particular as mentioned earlier the scratchpad element of interface can be used to drag and drop or otherwise enter search terms or other data. It will now be apparent therefore that input received at block can itself be considered contact data for analysis indexing and storage in processed data store . Those skilled in the art will recognize that search terms or data can include text including names locations professions uniform resource locators etc. images documents sound video files or other data objects which can be parsed and analyzed by the logic layer . Input data received in connection with scratchpad can be transmitted directly to computing device or can be pre processed as discussed above prior to transmission.

Having received input in the form of monitoring results from client device input data from terminal and the like processor can be configured at block to identify attributes from that input. The identification of attributes can be performed in substantially the same way as at block and the identified attributes can be maintained in memory either temporarily that is until the current performance of method is complete or for a longer period of time.

Proceeding to block processor can be configured to select contacts for instance by selecting name attributes from processed data store based on matches between the attributes associated with those contacts and the attributes detected or autonomously derived or inferred at block . For example if the gardening attribute is identified or otherwise derived at block then at block a certain configurable number of best matched name attributes can be selected. Best matched contacts can be those with the highest weighted gardening attribute association. Best matched contacts can also be in some embodiments those with the highest weighted gardening attribute as well as other attributes matching at least some attributes of a user profile maintained in memory . User profile is associated with client device and can contain data geographical keywords and the like relating to a user associated with client device . User profile can also include data relating to registered data sources actions carried out at client device in response to notifications which will be discussed shortly and the like.

It is contemplated that the performance of blocks and can be performed by at least keyword analysis module and search module in conjunction with matching module .

Once relevant contacts have been selected at block method proceeds to block at which processor can be configured to generate a notification at client device based on the context in which client device is being used and on the selected contacts. Generation of a notification includes the transmission of notification data from computing device via interface and network to client device for handling by processor . In some non limiting embodiments notifications can be generated as representations on display . In certain non limiting ones of such embodiments the representations can be displayed in the clipboard element of interface . In some embodiments recommendations can also be displayed within other applications for example within browser application via plugins included in contact agent client examples of which are shown in .

To better illustrate the performance of method and in particular of block an exemplary performance will be discussed below.

Alice meets Bob at an event and discovers that Bob s employer specializes in securing funding for non profit organizations. Upon return from the event Alice sends from her client device an email to Bob via a web based email application such as Gmail . Processor performing method transmits periodic requests to the server which maintains Alice s Gmail account and thereby obtains data blocks and relating to the email. Upon performance of block attributes are stored in processed data store for Bob including a name and an email address for instance . Additionally Alice manually enters the keywords non profit research and funding in a contact record for Bob maintained in memory . Computing device therefore also receives the above mentioned terms as contact data at the same or a subsequent performance of block . Computing device identifies funding as an attribute and associates it with Bob s name attribute along with a weighting factor. It is contemplated that Alice can also enter attributes directly into processed data store thus bypassing block by selection of the Contacts command in GUI .

At a later time Alice receives an email from another contact which mentions the keyword fundraiser . Processor executing contact agent client monitors the email application through which Alice is reading the email identifies the fundraiser keyword therein and transmits the keyword to computing device which receives the keyword as part of the performance of block . Processor via execution of at least keyword analysis module at block identifies the keyword fundraiser as corresponding to the attribute funding . Proceeding to block processor then determines that Bob s name attribute is associated with the attribute funding and selects Bob s name attribute as potential analyzed contact data of interest. Proceeding to block processor transmits notification data to client device which results in the control of display by processor to produce an interface as shown in .

It is contemplated that notifications generated at block need not necessarily be generated as described above. Notifications can also be generated in audible format for example. In other embodiments notifications can be provided from computing device to the user of client device via email social networking application messages also commonly referred to as in app Short Message Service SMS or Multimedia Message Service MMS messages and the like. The nature and frequency of notifications generated can be configured from within contact agent client by selection of the Notifications Updates command shown in . Such settings once accepted are transmitted to computing device for storage and consultation at block . Additionally notifications can be dependent on notification profiles used for example in smartphones. In such embodiments processor can be configured via execution of contact agent client to detect an active profile e.g. Busy Silent and the like on computing device and modify notifications accordingly.

In some embodiments one or both of mapping module and proximity detection module can also be invoked during the generation of notification data. The notification data transmitted at block can therefore include data allowing client device to display the selected contact or contacts on a map shown on display .

Notifications generated at block can also be displayed in clipboard at client device even when the notification settings of contact agent client prevent them from being displayed in other areas. That is processor can be configured to generate clipboard on display as an unfiltered stream of notifications only a portion of which are also provided elsewhere on client device . As such processor can additionally generate notifications for display by client device in clipboard without the execution of blocks and as discussed above. To that end processor can be configured to select one or more contacts automatically based simply on user profile without any other monitoring or receipt of input data. Thus execution of contact agent host can cause processor to determine relationships between user profile and other contacts autonomously based on the attributes in user profile and those in processed data store and to rank those relationships based on attribute matches and weighting. The unsolicited notifications resulting from this type of selection can be displayed in clipboard for later review though in some embodiments such notifications can also be provided as notification bars as discussed in connection with .

Referring now to a system is depicted according to another non limiting embodiment. Where components of system are similar to those of system they are similarly numbered with the exception of a leading 6 being used rather than a leading 1 . Thus system includes a client device with internal components not shown as discussed in relation to . System also includes servers and so on connected with client device via links and network to which client device is connected via link . Of note in system is that client device is the only computing device shown. In system client device can be a personal computer mobile electronic device and the like which is configured to provide the functionality of both the client and host applications discussed above. Client device thus includes in memory a contact agent application in addition to web browser application . Contact agent application configures processor for carrying out all the functionality of both the host and client applications described above. That is processor via execution of contact agent application is configured to obtain contact data from sources such as servers and to aggregate and index that data. Processor is further configured to monitor activities local to client device such as input received at input device and actions invoked by web browser application or other applications not shown and to select contacts and generate notifications based on the selections.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments the functionality of contact agent client and contact agent host can be implemented using pre programmed hardware or firmware elements e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs etc. or other related components.

In some embodiments the resources e.g. memory and processor and functionality of computing device may be partially or entirely distributed via one or more computing devices or servers in a construct known as a cloud or cloud computing as generally described by Wikipedia at http en.wikipedia.org wiki Cloud computing. For example with reference to method processor and memory can be distributed among several computing devices and servers with processing of method being coordinated by methods and algorithms well known by those skilled in the art.

It is also contemplated that in some embodiments that servers and associated applications may be provided via cloud computing methods and practices. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there are yet more alternative implementations and modifications possible for implementing the embodiments and that the above implementations and examples are only illustrations of one or more embodiments. The scope therefore is only to be limited by the claims appended hereto.
