The techniques of this disclosure may provide several advantages. For example these techniques may simplify the task of verifying claims by service providers of providing the best service or most coverage. These techniques may also provide a mechanism by which to recommend a service provider based on one or more criteria including for example areas frequented by a user requesting the service provider recommendation.

The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In general this disclosure describes techniques for collecting and distributing network performance information for mobile devices. The techniques may include collecting network performance information from a plurality of mobile devices which may be configured to use services provided by various service providers. The mobile devices may each periodically determine a signal quality value at a particular geographic position and then upload the signal quality and position data to a centralized server along with an indication of a service provider for the respective mobile device. In various examples the signal quality value may reflect any or all of latency data transfer rates packet loss rates data corruption rates signal to noise ratios or other measures of signal quality.

The server may aggregate the signal quality data for various regions. The server may then determine which service providers have the highest signal qualities in the respective regions. Similar or additional determinations may be made for particular networks mobile device models or other criteria. This data may be used for many purposes. For example the service providers may use this data to determine whether particular regions require improvements e.g. addition or repair of cellular towers in the regions. Consumers may also use the data to determine which service provider to subscribe to in a particular region or when a service provider has upgraded a region e.g. by installing a new cellular tower in the region. In this manner the techniques may be used to provide a comprehensive real time system for gathering summarizing and exposing information about the quality of a network given a geographical position.

As another example the data may be used to make a recommendation of a service provider and or mobile device based on one or more locations frequented by a user and devices sold by a service provider. For example a user may provide an indication of one or more locations at which the user spends a significant amount of time e.g. home work on the road to work a friend or relative s house or other locations. The user may further rank the importance of having a strong service signal or high data transfer rates in such regions. In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure a recommendation engine may retrieve data for each of the regions of interest for a user and calculate which of a plurality of service providers would provide the best service for the user based on the user s criteria for the regions. Additionally the recommendation engine may take into account other constraints such as for example specific services requested by a user features of phones sold by the service provider e.g. a camera of a particular resolution or a physical keyboard available connection types pricing restrictions or other constraints. The recommendation engine may exclude service providers that do not satisfy these constraints or reduce a score for a service provider that does not satisfy the constraints.

Mobile devices may correspond to any devices that are configured to receive and or transmit data via a wireless network. For example mobile devices may correspond to any or all of cellular telephones laptops equipped with wireless access cards or navigation system units. Mobile devices may communicate via a wireless network provided by any of a plurality of service providers. The wireless network may conform to any mobile telecommunications standard such as for example International Mobile Telecommunications 2000 ITM 2000 or 3G or ITM Advanced also referred to as 4G Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or any other mobile telecommunications standard such as those defined by the International Telecommunication Union.

In general mobile devices are configured to periodically upload signal quality and position data to data repository . For example users of mobile devices may have downloaded an application that runs on each of mobile devices to periodically upload the signal quality and position data. As another example mobile devices may transparently to the users execute an operating system module that periodically uploads the signal quality and position data. In examples including sanitation server mobile devices may upload the data via sanitation server while in other examples mobile devices may upload the data directly to data repository . Web based applications executing on mobile devices may send signal quality data along with a geographic position corresponding to the signal quality data to sanitation server which does not log the data but forwards the data on to data repository which may log the data as described in greater detail below. In general users may be provided with the ability to opt in and or opt out of a service that periodically uploads the signal quality and position data. For example a user interface screen in a settings menu of mobile devices may enable a user to opt in or opt out of data collection by a remote server such as the uploading of position and signal quality data to data repository .

Mobile devices may communicate with sanitation server or data repository according to a network communication protocol such as for example hypertext transfer protocol HTTP HTTP secured by transport layer security or secure sockets layer HTTPS simple mail transfer protocol SMTP simple object access protocol SOAP or other communication protocols. Mobile devices may also be configured to send data via text messages according to the short message service SMS or multimedia messaging service MMS . Mobile devices may additionally communicate the data to data repository via other devices not shown in such as for example cellular towers routers switches gateways security devices such as firewalls or other devices for cellular wireless and or network communication. In some examples mobile devices are configured to automatically upload signal quality and geographic position data to data repository e.g. at predetermined times while in other examples data repository and or sanitation server requests the data from mobile devices .

The data collected by mobile devices and sent to data repository may further include other information that may be useful in differentiating signal quality for mobile devices . For example the data may include an identifier of a service provider also referred to in this disclosure as a carrier that provides service to the respective one of mobile devices . As another example the data may include an identification of a manufacturer of and or the device model for the respective one of mobile devices that uploaded the data. As still another example the data may include an identification of a connection type such as 3G 4G EDGE or other connection type for the connection corresponding to the one of mobile devices . Mobile devices may upload data that includes any or all of a time of day a service provider a connection type a device type or other data in addition to the geographic position value and the signal quality value to data repository .

Data repository may provide to client devices an application programming interface API such as for example 

where RequestData can contain any combination of conditions for parameters such as request response size carrier name network type etc. Data repository may provide summarized values for unpopulated parameters. The summary may correspond to a mean median or other average value. The default response may include the average transfer rate for up downstream data for the most recent records within a radius of X meters from the given location where X may be a customizable parameter . A user can also specify such things as including all requests with Y meters of the given location or over some specific period of time.

The data stored by data repository may include request specific data such as the size of a request and response service provider identification network connection type signal strength date and time device brand model operating system version or other data. Data repository may create a large database of transfer rates e.g. latency values or other signal quality values for different geographical positions and request specific data so that client devices may query the data.

Sanitation server when present in system is configured to remove personally identifiable information from data received from mobile devices . For example when data received from mobile devices includes any or all of an Internet protocol IP address a client identifier a username or other identifying information sanitation server may remove this information from the data and then send the data to data repository . Sanitation server may be configured such that received data is stored only for a length of time sufficient to remove this information can be removed and the data can be forwarded to data repository . In some examples sanitation server forwards data to data repository in batches to further prevent the possibility of identifying users of mobile devices by data repository or devices coupled to data repository such as client devices . That is sanitation server may send data to data repository received from mobile devices at defined intervals rather than contemporaneous with receipt of data from mobile devices . System may include multiple sanitation servers in some examples such that mobile devices may upload data via a nearest one of the sanitation servers. In some examples sanitation server may be configured to periodically drop data received from mobile devices to reduce the chances of another device or user being able to reconstruct the positions of any particular individual user of mobile devices from the data. In some examples sanitation server may be configured to periodically generate random dummy data or tweak received data slightly again to reduce the chances of another device or user being able to reconstruct the positions of any particular individual user of mobile devices from the data.

Data repository receives and aggregates signal quality data for various locations. In general this disclosure refers to a location as a region encompassing a geographic area having a particular size. The locations may each have the same size or may have different sizes. In general when one of mobile devices such as mobile device A uploads data to data repository the uploaded data includes a geographic position of mobile device A at a particular time as well as a signal quality value at the geographic position and at the time. Upon receiving data from one of mobile devices data repository may extract the geographic position and determine a location including the geographic position and then calculate an aggregate of signal quality values including the recently received signal quality value from the mobile device for the location. Data repository may also store the data as raw data entries in a database.

Signal quality may include quality values for various types of signals used by mobile devices such as for example a dedicated voice signal and a data signal. The techniques of this disclosure are discussed primarily with respect to a data signal received by mobile devices . However it should be understood that similar techniques may be applied to voice signals received by mobile devices .

Mobile devices may be configured to determine the signal quality value and the geographic position value in a variety of ways. The signal quality value for example may correspond to latency of data transfer e.g. the round trip delay between a request for data and when the data is received. The signal quality value may also correspond to an average data transfer rate. The request for data may correspond to a user s request for data e.g. a user initiated hypertext transfer protocol HTTP request using a browser of the one of mobile devices . The request may also correspond to a request automatically sent by mobile devices such as a ping request. Mobile devices may be configured to measure latency e.g. the time between sending the request and receiving the requested data and set the signal quality value according to the measured latency.

In other examples the signal quality value may correspond to metrics other than or in addition to latency. For example the signal quality value may correspond to a received signal strength indication RSSI which is a measurement of power in a received radio signal. As another example the signal quality value may correspond to a signal to noise SNR ratio value. As another example the signal quality value may correspond to a data transfer rate. As another example the signal quality value may correspond to media access control MAC layer measurements of signal quality such as for example measurements of errors occurring in MAC layer data received by the signal.

Mobile devices may be configured to determine a geographic position in a variety of ways. Mobile devices need not each determine a respective geographic position in the same way. For example certain ones of mobile devices may be equipped with a global positioning system GPS receiver while others of mobile devices may be configured to determine a geographical position by triangulating the position based on signal strengths of nearby cellular towers. Mobile devices including a GPS receiver may determine the geographic position by retrieving the geographic position from the GPS receiver. On the other hand mobile devices that do not include a GPS receiver may calculate the geographic position by triangulating a position from nearby cellular towers. For example one of mobile devices that does not include a GPS receiver may calculate relative signal strengths of nearby cellular towers and correlate the signal strength of a tower with distance from the tower. Then based on the correlated distances from nearby towers and the positions of the nearby towers the one of mobile devices may estimate a current geographic position for itself.

Data repository may be configured to store geographic position values in a common format e.g. a format similar to a GPS format. Accordingly when data repository receives a data set including a geographic position value in a different format such as a format corresponding to the use of triangulation to determine the position value data repository may convert the geographic position value to the common format. In some examples the GPS format may correspond to a latitude longitude integer in tenths of microdegrees also referred to as E7 format. That is the GPS format may describe a latitude position in fractions of microdegrees and a longitude position in fractions of microdegrees.

Client devices may interact with data repository to retrieve data uploaded from mobile devices . Client devices may use this data in a variety of ways. For example a service provider may use one of client devices to retrieve the data and determine locations that need network maintenance or upgrades such as a need for repair replacement or addition of cellular towers. Service providers advertisers and others may also validate claims of providing the best service best coverage or other such claims using the signal quality data.

As another example one of mobile devices or a different mobile device may retrieve the data to determine if a nearby location has a better signal quality than a current position. In this manner mobile devices may also act as client devices . As an example a user may experience poor signal quality in a current location while using one of mobile devices e.g. mobile device A. Mobile device A may retrieve signal quality values for locations near the current location determine which of the locations has a better signal quality if any and then display instructions to the user to move to the location. For example mobile device A may display a message that states Signal quality at your current location is low. Please move 15 meters northeast for a better signal. 

As another example one of client devices may correspond to a data provider for example a server that determines a current location of one of mobile devices e.g. mobile device A. The data provider may request the current geographic position from mobile device A when mobile device A requests data from the data provider. Alternatively mobile device A may include an indication of the current geographic position along with a request for data. The data provider may use the current geographic position of mobile device A then query data repository for an aggregate signal quality at the location including the geographic position of mobile device A. Then the data provider may use the aggregate signal quality value to determine an amount of data to send to mobile device A. For example when the data provider is a video server the data provider may send a high quality version of video data having a relatively high bitrate for example to mobile device A when the aggregate signal quality is relatively high in the location but send a lower quality version of the video data to mobile device A when the aggregate signal quality is relatively low in the location.

As another example and as discussed in greater detail below a recommendation server as discussed with respect to for example may retrieve the data from data repository . The recommendation server may determine which service provider provides the best service at one or more locations and then provide a recommendation of a service provider based on one or more locations frequented by a user. That is the user may select the one or more locations and request a recommendation of the service provider with the highest signal quality at the one or more locations. The recommendation server may determine which of the service providers has the highest signal quality at the one or more locations and provide a recommendation of that service provider to the user. In some examples the recommendation server also determines a particular mobile device or type of device to recommend to a user based on requests from the user devices that fit criteria specified in the request devices provided e.g. sold by a service provider recommended to the user or other criteria.

In this manner system may provide a mechanism for mining organizing and exposing information about mobile network performance. Client devices may request historical information such as average throughput rate for mobile data in a particular location based on various criteria such as for example date time of day network connection type service provider and other similar data. A computing device within data repository or coupled to data repository may mine data repository for data transfer rates based on GPS coordinates.

System may provide one or more advantages. For example system may simplify the task of verifying claims by service providers of providing the best service or most coverage for a provided service. System may also provide a mechanism by which to recommend a service provider based on one or more criteria including for example areas frequented by a user requesting the service provider recommendation.

In general when mobile devices send data such as geographic positions and signal quality values to data repository write only database server receives the data from mobile devices . Synchronization engine synchronizes data between write only database server and read only database server . In some examples synchronization engine writes new data received by write only database server to read only database server shortly following receipt by write only database server . In other examples synchronization engine periodically determines whether write only database server has received new data and synchronizes the new data to read only database server . In still other examples synchronization engine may determine whether any of client devices are reading data from read only database server and synchronize data between write only database server when read only database server is not providing data to client devices . In still other examples synchronization engine may synchronize data between write only database server and read only database server when mobile devices are not writing data to read only database server and client devices are not reading data from read only database server .

In this manner mobile devices may be able to uninterruptedly provide data to data repository and client devices may be able to uninterruptedly retrieve data from data repository . That is data repository may avoid conflicts in situations when for example one or more of mobile devices attempt to write data to data repository at the same time that one or more of client devices attempt to read data from data repository .

The description of data repository provided with respect to is one example for data repository . In other examples data repository may include a single database that is locked or unlocked to prevent contemporaneous reads and writes.

Control unit may include any combination of hardware software and or firmware for performing the functions attributed to control unit . For example control unit may include a computer readable storage medium encoded with instructions for data aggregation module location management module and query engine as well as a processor that executes the instructions. In another example control unit may include one or more microprocessors digital signal processors DSPs application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry as well as any combinations of such components. Similarly any or all of data aggregation module location management module and query engine may be functionally integrated.

Network interfaces receive and output data over a network such as the Internet. In one example one of network interfaces may correspond to an interface for receiving data from mobile devices . In one example one of network interfaces may correspond to an interface for receiving data from synchronization engine . In any case input interfaces of network interfaces receive data including geographical position values and corresponding signal strength and or quality values at the respective geographical position values. Output interfaces of network interfaces may in various examples include one or more interfaces for outputting data to synchronization engine and or client devices . In some examples input and output network interfaces may be functionally integrated while in other examples input and output interfaces may be separate interfaces of network interfaces . For example network interfaces may include one or more network interface cards NICs configured to communicate over for example Ethernet transmission control protocol TCP Internet protocol IP asynchronous transfer mode ATM or other network communication protocols. In some examples database server may include a plurality of either or both input and output interfaces.

Database may include various fields such as geographic position signal quality time of day service provider connection type device type or other fields. Control unit may store position data to database in the geographic position field in a format similar to a global positioning system GPS format e.g. including a latitude value in degrees minutes and seconds and a longitude value in degrees minutes and seconds. Control unit may also store an altitude value to database with the geographic position value. In some examples control unit may convert a geographic position value received from one of mobile devices to a GPS format e.g. when the mobile device uploads the value in a different format such as a triangulated position format. Control unit may store signal quality values in the signal quality field of database . In some examples database may be structured as a Google File System and or a Google BigTable database system.

Data aggregation module receives geographical position values and corresponding signal strength and or quality values from mobile devices via input interface . Upon receiving a geographical position value and a corresponding signal strength value data aggregation module determines a location including the geographical position value and calculates an aggregate signal strength and or quality value for the location based on a previous aggregate signal strength and or quality value and the received signal strength value corresponding to the received geographical position value. In some examples data aggregation module weights all signal strength values equally while in other examples data aggregation module weights recently received signal strength values more heavily than previously received signal strength and or quality values. Data aggregation module may also utilize any moving average function to calculate an aggregate signal strength value for the location based on a newly received signal strength value and an existing aggregate signal strength value for the location. For example data aggregation module may calculate a cumulative moving average a weighted moving average an exponential moving average or a modified moving average of the signal strength values for a location to calculate the aggregate signal strength value.

In one example to weight signal strength values equally data aggregation module maintains an entry counter for the location as well as an aggregate signal strength value for the location. Accordingly upon receiving a new signal strength value for the location data aggregation module may multiply the current aggregate signal strength value by the entry counter add the newly received signal strength value and then divide by the entry counter value plus one. The following pseudocode provides an example implementation for equally weighting each signal strength value of a location.

The example pseudocode returns a float that is a floating point value representative of the new aggregate strength value for the location value received as an argument aggregated with the new signal strength value received as the argument newSigStrength. The pseudocode also receives an object of type Location named location and a floating point value newSigStrength as an argument. The newSigStrength value is a signal strength value of newly received data from a mobile device at a geographical position within the location corresponding to the received location value. Each entry is weighted equally because the existing aggregate value currentAggValue set by calling getAggStrength location is multiplied by the current number of entries entryCount set by calling getEntryCount location . This product is then added to newSigStrength which represents the signal strength value of a newly received signal strength value corresponding to the location. This sum is then divided by entryCount 1 which weights the new signal strength value equally with all other previously received entries for the location resulting in a new aggregate signal strength value newAggStrength . The location s entry count value is then incremented e.g. set to a value equal to the previous value plus one incrementEntryCount location and the location s aggregate strength value is reset by calling setAggStrength location newAggStrength . In other examples rather than using floating point values a scaled integer or double value may be used in the algorithm for aggregateSignalValues.

In some examples data aggregation module also receives data via network interfaces from mobile devices and stores the received data in database . That is in addition to calculating aggregate signal strength values for locations corresponding to geographic positions for which new signal strength values are received data aggregation module may also add raw data to database . Database server may receive any or all of an indication of a carrier e.g. a service provider a connection type and or a device type from mobile devices in addition to a geographical position value and a corresponding signal quality value. When database server receives a geographical position value in a format other than the format for geographical position values stored by database control unit may convert the value to a format corresponding to the format of geographical values stored by database .

Administrator may configure database server via administrator interface . Administrator interface may include one or more of a display a keyboard a mouse a touchscreen a light pen speakers or other input and or output devices for interacting with database server . In other examples administrator may configure database server using a remote computing device that is communicatively coupled to database server e.g. according to the simple network management protocol SNMP . Administrator may also log into database server remotely using for example a secure shell protocol SSH client a Telnet client Remote Desktop or other applications and modify configuration of database server . In such examples administrator interface may be functionally integrated with network interfaces for participating in such network sessions.

Location management module provides mechanisms by which a user such as administrator may manage locations for which data are received by database server . As discussed in this disclosure a location may correspond to a geographical area having a particular size e.g. several square meters. In some examples a location is a square or rectangular shaped geographical area while in other examples a location may be circular hexagonal or any other geometric shape. In general a location may include data for one or more geographical positions.

As an example a location may be defined as a circular region with a center at a particular geographical position and a radius of a defined size e.g. six meters. As another example a location may be defined as a square region with a first corner at a defined geographical position a second corner at a geographical position a distance D to the east of the first corner a third corner at a geographical position at distance D to the south of the first corner and a fourth corner at a geographical position at distance D to the east and distance D to the south of the first corner. Other similar techniques may also be used to define a location. Geographical positions falling within the area of a location are said to be located within the respective location. Thus with respect to the circular region example a geographical position would be located within the location if the geographical position were a distance from the center of the circle that is less than the radius of the circle.

Location management module may enable administrator to configure the size of locations view or modify data for locations stored by database create new locations set the size of each location to the same value or set the size of locations independently set the geometric shape of the locations or perform other similar actions. Administrator may also use location management module to determine whether a particular geographical position for which data has been received falls within two or more locations or whether two or more locations overlap the same geographical position or area. In some examples data for a geographical position that falls within two or more locations may be aggregated into each aggregate signal strength value for the respective locations. In other examples location management module may e.g. automatically or at the direction of administrator aggregate the signal strength values for the geographical position into only one of the locations.

Query engine may receive and process queries from for example client devices via network interfaces . Query engine may process each query to determine entries of database that satisfy the query. Query engine may return the entries that satisfy the query to a requester that issued the query. Database may be structured as a relational database in which case the queries may correspond to relational database queries for example structured query language SQL queries. Accordingly query engine may implement SQL or another relational database querying language to process the queries. In other examples database may be structured as a multidimensional database and or be configured for online analytic processing OLAP in which case query engine may be configured to execute multidimensional expression MDX queries and or online analytical processing OLAP queries.

Recommendation server in the example of includes repository interface location manager criteria calculator and device interface . Repository interface and or device interface may correspond to network interfaces such as network interface cards NICs for communicating with data repository and client device respectively. Repository interface may be communicatively coupled to data repository via one or more intermediate devices e.g. network devices such as routers switches gateways security devices servers clients or other network devices that support network communication. Similarly device interface may be communicatively coupled to client device via one or more intermediate devices.

User may be a user searching for a service provider for a mobile device such as for example a cellular telephone a smart phone a wireless Internet card a navigation device or other mobile device. User may already be in possession of a current mobile device. For example client device may be a mobile device. Alternatively client device may be a stationary device or a device that is not used with a service provider network of the type for which user is seeking a recommendation.

User may input a set of one or more geographic positions where user particularly desires service availability and relatively high quality signal strengths. These positions may be referred to in this disclosure as positions of interest of user . These positions may correspond to geographic positions where user spends a relatively high amount of time during an average week. For example user may select positions corresponding to the user s work home a friend or relative s house paths e.g. roads between geographic positions or other places frequented by user .

To receive the positions of interest client device may present a graphical user interface including a map and or a set of text fields. User may input a position of interest by typing an address for the position of interest in an address text field or by selecting a point on the map. In some examples client device may correspond to a mobile device equipped with an application that automatically determines places where user frequents when user enables the application to do so.

For example client device may periodically determine a geographical position of client device as well as a time of day. If the current geographical position is within a certain distance of one or more previous geographical positions for a period of time or at a particular time of day client device may automatically assign one of the geographical positions as a position of interest. For example client device may determine a central geographic position that is a geographic position located at or near the center of the geographic positions at which client device was present for a period of time is a position of interest.

Moreover client device may automatically label the position of interest based on the time of day during which client device is present at the geographical positions. For example if client device is within a certain distance of a geographical position from 8 00 am to 5 00 pm client device may automatically label a corresponding position of interest work. As another example if client device is within a certain distance of a geographical position from 6 00 pm to 7 00 am on weekdays and or all day or a majority of the day on weekends client device may automatically label the corresponding position of interest home. In some examples client device may correspond to a device executing Google Latitude to retrieve the current location of client device .

Moreover an application executing on client device may periodically retrieve the location of client device to determine areas frequented by user of client device e.g. to automatically configure geographical positions of interest for user . The application may also be configured to automatically set weight values for locations based on for example time spent in respective locations including the geographic positions. For example when client device spends 40 hours per week in a first location and 20 hours per week in a second location the application may set a first weight value for the first location at a value that is twice the value of a second weight value for the second location. The application may further be configured to automatically determine the weight value based on whether another signal is available at the location. For example if the application determines that a wireless access point is present in a location the application may automatically reduce the weight value for the location.

Client device may also allow user to assign weights that is weight values to each of the positions of interest or to modify automatically configured weights. For example client device may present a user interface that displays a map including the positions of interest and a representation of a weight value on or near each of the positions of interest. The representation may include a graphical or textual representation such as for example a graphical sliding bar or a text field for entering a numeric weight value. User may adjust the graphical sliding bar or enter a textual value in the text field to assign a weight value to a position of interest corresponding to the representation of the weight value. Client device uploads weight values and corresponding geographical positions that is positions of interest to recommendation server via device interface . User may provide other criteria along with a request for a service provider recommendation such as for example desired services requirements for particular mobile devices sold by the service provider availability of particular mobile devices or other features or criteria.

Recommendation server may receive a request for a service provider recommendation from client device . The request may include one or more positions of interest and associated weight values. In some examples the request may only include one or more positions of interest without associated weight values. After receiving the request via device interface criteria calculator evaluates each criteria of the request to determine a service provider to recommend. Criteria calculator may determine for each of the positions of interest a location including the respective position of interest. Location manager may provide an indication to criteria calculator of a location that includes a region of interest as well as a corresponding aggregate signal quality value for the location.

Location manager may be configured similarly to location management module . In some examples recommendation server may include or use location manager only when data repository does not include a location management module similar to location management module . In such examples recommendation server may extract raw data from data repository and calculate aggregate signal quality values for each of a plurality of locations corresponding to the positions of interest received from client device .

Criteria calculator may calculate individual service provider scores for each location including at least one of the positions of interest received in the request. For example criteria calculator may determine an aggregate signal quality value for each service provider at a particular location. Criteria calculator may further refine an individual service provider score at a location based on the weight value received from client device for the corresponding position of interest. The weight values may correspond to percentage values integer values rational numbers or other values that user generally manipulates to provide a relative indication of importance of having a high quality signal at a corresponding position of interest. For example user may set a weight value for work relatively high if for example the workplace does not provide wireless broadband access to user . As another example user may set a weight value for home relatively low if for example user has a wireless access point that is connected to the Internet. That is rather than connecting to a wireless signal while at home the mobile device may instead connect to the Internet via the wireless access point.

After calculating scores for each service provider at each location including a position of interest criteria calculator may aggregate the scores for each service provider. Criteria calculator may then determine which service provider has the highest aggregate score for user . Criteria calculator may then provide a recommendation to user via client device based on the highest aggregate score. Criteria calculator may also provide a rank ordered list of recommendations of service providers e.g. in an order corresponding to the calculated scores for the service providers.

Mobile device A may then determine a current signal quality value corresponding to the geographic position . For example mobile device A may measure a signal strength calculate latency for requested and received data measure a current signal to noise ratio calculate a data transfer rate calculate packet loss calculate a data corruption rate determine a current bit rate determine a current RSSI value or otherwise determine a signal quality value at the current geographic position. Other signal quality values may include inter packet time values that correspond to the gap of time between receipt of packets.

Mobile device A may then upload the current geographic position and corresponding signal quality value to for example data repository . Although illustrates only one instance of a mobile device sending a geographic position and corresponding signal quality value to a data repository it should be understood that the mobile device may perform steps multiple times periodically. Moreover mobile device A may include additional data such as for example an indication of a device type for mobile device A an indication of a service provider for mobile device A and or an indication of a connection type for mobile device A.

After data repository receives a signal quality value for a geographic position data repository may update an aggregate signal quality value for a location that includes the received geographic position . Data repository may also add an entry to a database that includes raw data received from mobile device A. In this manner a client device may query the raw data or retrieve an aggregate signal quality value for a location directly.

In the example of a recommendation server such as recommendation server then requests signal quality data for one or more geographic positions . Recommendation server may request raw data from the data repository that includes not only signal quality values but also any other corresponding data such as for example an indication of a service provider an indication of a connection type and or an indication of a device type that uploaded the data. In some examples recommendation server may request only raw data that includes an indication of a service provider from the data repository.

Data repository may respond to the request from the recommendation server by providing signal quality data for each of the requested positions to the recommendation server . For example a query engine may determine which entries in a database of data repository have geographical positions corresponding to one of the requested positions e.g. are within a location that includes at least one of the requested positions or are within a certain range of at least one of the requested positions. Data repository may provide matching entries from the database to the recommendation server. In some examples data repository may provide aggregate signal quality values for locations including the requested geographical positions to the recommendation server without providing raw data to the recommendation server. In some examples data repository may further determine individual service provider signal quality values for each of the locations and send these individual service provider signal quality values to the recommendation server.

After receiving the signal quality data from the data repository recommendation server may determine which service provider is best for the requested geographical positions . For example recommendation server may apply weight values received from a user to particular locations to determine which of the service providers is best for the set of locations. Recommendation server may also evaluate other criteria to determine which of the service providers is best for the set of geographical positions such as whether the service providers offer a particular model of mobile device a particular service and or a particular connection type.

Initially database server receives a geographical position and a corresponding signal quality value via one of network interfaces . Data aggregation module or another module executed by control unit may then store the signal quality value as being associated with the geographical position e.g. by storing a new entry in database that includes the geographical position and the signal quality value. Data aggregation module may then determine a location that includes the received geographic position value . That is data aggregation module may determine an area of one of a plurality of locations in which the geographic position occurs.

Data aggregation module may then update an aggregate signal quality value for the determined location based on the received signal quality value . For example data aggregation module may calculate a moving average based on the received signal quality value as well as signal quality values corresponding to other geographical positions also within the location for which data was previously received. After calculating the aggregate signal quality value for the location data aggregation module may store the aggregate signal quality value e.g. in a separate table of database .

Initially database server may receive a request for signal quality data at a particular geographical position . For example database server may receive the request via one of network interfaces . The request may specify a geographical location e.g. in a GPS format. In some examples the request may specify a postal address format. In such examples control unit may execute a function to convert the geographical location in the postal address format to a GPS format. For example control unit may determine a GPS format position value for the postal address format value based on a mapping program such as Google Earth or Google Maps that includes the ability to retrieve addresses and GPS format geographical position values.

The request may be structured in the form of a database query such as an SQL query. For example the request may be structured according to the format SELECT FROM WHERE where the SELECT clause indicates columns from which to retrieve data the FROM clause indicates a table from which to retrieve data and the WHERE clause specifies criteria for extracting data such as that the geographical position of the request is between geographical positions defining boundaries for a location.

In some examples database server may receive a request not in the form of an SQL query but then construct an SQL query based on the request to retrieve data from database for the request. For example the request may specify a geographical position X Y where X represents a latitude element and Y represents a longitude element. Query engine may identify a location having boundaries that encompass the geographical position of the request. For example query engine may determine a location having a northern boundary NB that is to the north of X a southern boundary SB that is to the south of X an eastern boundary EB that is to the east of Y and a western boundary WB that is to the west of Y.

Query engine may then construct a query such as for example SELECT FROM SigQualityTable WHERE NB XPOS AND SBXPOS AND SB

Query engine may execute the request to retrieve a geographical position value from the request. Query engine may further determine a location that includes the geographical position of the request e.g. by interacting with location management module . That is query engine may determine a location having a geographical area in which the geographical position of the request is present. For example query engine may determine boundaries of the location where the boundaries may be defined as geographical positions and determine whether the geographical position of the request is between the boundaries defined for the location.

Query engine may then retrieve entries of database having geographical positions within the determined location that includes the geographical position of the request . That is for each entry of database query engine may determine whether a geographical position of the entry is within the location determined to include the geographical position of the request. In the example of query engine starts with a first entry of database and determines whether a geographical position value for the entry is within the location for the request .

When the entry has a position value within the location for the request YES branch of query engine includes data from the entry in a result set e.g. a set of data to be returned to the requester. The result set generally includes data from entries of database having geographical positions within the location determined to include the geographical position of the request. On the other hand when the entry does not have a position value within the determined location NO branch of query engine determines whether the current entry is the last entry of database .

When the current entry is not the last entry of database NO branch of query engine moves to a next entry of database determines whether this entry has a geographical position within the location and if so includes data from the entry in the result set . On the other hand when the current entry is the last entry of database YES branch of database server may output the result set via one of network interfaces to return the result set to a requesting device .

Initially recommendation server receives a service provider recommendation request e.g. from client device . The request may include one or more geographical positions e.g. representing areas frequented by a user providing the recommendation or areas where the user desires to have a relatively high signal quality value. The request may further include weight values corresponding to the geographical position values . As noted above client device may correspond to a mobile device such as one of mobile devices . Client device may therefore be configured to automatically include geographic position values in the request based on a period of time client device spends in the geographic positions corresponding to the geographic position values. The weightings may further reflect the amount of time spent in the respective geographic positions.

Starting with the first geographical position of the request criteria calculator may retrieve signal quality data for a location including the geographical position . That is criteria calculator may determine a location that includes the geographical position and then request signal quality data for the location from data repository . In some examples rather than determining the location criteria calculator may request signal quality data near the geographical position of the request and data repository may determine a location including the geographical position to return signal quality data for the location to recommendation server . Criteria calculator may request only signal quality data that also includes an indication of a service provider corresponding to the data from data repository .

Criteria calculator separates the signal quality data for a location into groups based on respective service providers . That is for each service provider criteria calculator may determine which portion of the retrieved data for the current location corresponds to the service provider. Criteria calculator may then calculate a score for each service provider at the current location . For example criteria calculator may aggregate the service quality scores for a service provider at the location and multiply this aggregated service quality score by the weight value corresponding to the location. Criteria calculator may then update an aggregate score for each service provider based on the service provider scores calculated for the current location .

Criteria calculator then determines whether the current location is the last location that is the last requested geographical position to be analyzed . When more geographical positions remain to be analyzed for the request NO branch of criteria calculator repeats steps for the next geographical position in the request . On the other hand after all geographical positions have been analyzed YES branch of criteria calculator determines which of the service providers has the highest aggregate score . Recommendation server may then recommend the service provider having the highest aggregate score . Recommendation server may also provide an indication of rankings of the service providers in order of aggregate score as well as an indication of the aggregate scores for each service provider. In some examples recommendation server may provide the recommendation of the service provider to the mobile device that provided the geographic position values in the request to recommendation server . In this manner recommendation server may provide the recommendation directly to the mobile device for which a service provider recommendation is being sought.

The following pseudocode provides an example implementation for determining a service provider abbreviated SP in the pseudocode to recommend based on a set of geographic positions deemed important by a user and a set of corresponding weights of importance. The pseudocode below provides an example implementation of the method of . Instructions corresponding to the pseudocode may be encoded in a computer readable storage medium and executed by a processing unit of a computing device.

The pseudocode above provides a function recommendSP that receives a set of locations locations and a set of corresponding weights weights as arguments and returns an integer corresponding to one of a plurality of service providers. It is assumed for the purpose of this example that each service provider is enumerated in a particular order. The pseudocode above calculates an array of floating point values for the service providers SPScore such that an entry in the array corresponds to the score for a particular service provider. The pseudocode iterates through each location and each service provider to update a score for the service provider at the location. In this example the updating of the score includes adding the original value of the service provider s score to the aggregate strength of the service provider at the location multiplied by the weight corresponding to the location.

After calculating scores for each of the service providers the pseudocode determines which of the scores is highest and which of the service providers has the highest score. In this example the pseudocode iterates through the scores for each of the service providers and compares the service provider s score to a maximum score. When the current service provider s score is higher than the maximum score the pseudocode updates the maximum score and an identifier of the service provider that has the maximum score. Finally the pseudocode returns the identifier of the service provider with the maximum score to provide a service provider recommendation.

In some examples particular values described in the pseudocode may be implemented as software objects that is data structures having member functions and member data. For example a location may be implemented as an object having member data defining geographical boundaries of the location a size e.g. geographical area of the location and an aggregate signal quality value for the location. The location object may include member functions for retrieving and or setting the values for the member data as well as to calculate or update the value of the signal quality value for the location based on a new signal quality value corresponding to a geographical position that lies within the boundaries for the location. The location object may further include a member function for determining whether a geographical position is within the location. An array linked list or other data structure may also be used to store a set of location objects.

In addition to the criteria described above recommendation server may evaluate an average data transfer rate in each of the locations for each of the service providers coverage percentage over a region including a plurality of locations and a number of holes in a coverage area where a hole may be defined as a transition between an area with coverage to one without in the user s travel patterns. Recommendation server may also evaluate other criteria including for example a price range for a device and or service plan carriers to be avoided minimum capabilities of a device e.g. requirements that the device must have a camera or a physical keyboard or other such constraints.

Recommendation server may exclude service providers from the results that do not conform to these constraints or may reduce a score or ranking in a result set for the service providers that do not conform to the constraints. In some examples a user may subscribe to updates from recommendation server such that if the recommendation provided by recommendation server were to change recommendation server may alert the user with a new recommendation. In some examples a client device such as client device may be configured to perform a method similar to that described with respect to to pull data directly from data repository and provide a service provider recommendation.

Locations each include a number of geographical positions A Z geographical positions . Each of geographical positions occurs within a respective one of locations . In general a geographical position occurs within a location when the geographical position is surrounded by defined borders of the location. Thus for example geographical positions A and B are within location A while geographical positions C D E F are within location B.

Each of the geographical positions selected in the example of lies within a particular location where boundaries of the locations are represented by dashed lines in the example of . In the example of locations are identified by a row value A B C or D and a column value through . For example home lies within location B work lies within location D and relative s house lies within location D. Path crosses a number of locations including locations B B C D C D and D.

User interface also enables the user to assign weights to each geographical position or set of associated geographical positions in the case of road . User interface may present one of scroll bars A D scroll bars in association with each geographical position. In the example of scroll bar A is associated with home scroll bar B is associated with path scroll bar C is associated with work and scroll bar D is associated with relative s house .

Each of scroll bars includes an up arrow a down arrow and a slider. For example scroll bar A includes up arrow A down arrow A and slider A. When a user selects up arrow A e.g. using a pointer controlled by a mouse slider A moves up scroll bar A and when the user selects down arrow A slider A moves down scroll bar A. The user may also select slider A with the pointer and move slider A along scroll bar A.

In general the position of the slider of a scroll bar is indicative of a weight set by the user for the corresponding geographical position. For example each scroll bar may have a range of values between 1 and 100. Slider A may represent a value of 5 for home . Slider B may represent a value of 100 for path . Slider C may represent a value of 15 for work . Slider D may represent a value for relative s house .

In some examples the recommendation server may modify scores based on various criteria. For example recommendation server may attempt to identify coverage holes along path . A hole may correspond to a location along a frequently traveled route such as path that does not have connectivity or has intermittent data transfer failures. The recommendation engine may automatically adjust the weight for such a location to bias the recommendation in favor of a service provider that does not have holes along a path or has the fewest holes along the path. For example if a first service provider has a hole at location C in but has very good signal quality values for the other locations including path while a second service provider has no holes along path but relatively lower signal quality along path recommendation server may nevertheless recommend the second service provider due to the lack of holes along path .

After a user has selected geographical positions and set corresponding weight values user interface may pass the geographical positions and corresponding weight values to an application. The application may package the geographical positions and corresponding weight values into a request for a service provider recommendation and send the request to a recommendation server. For locations corresponding to the geographical positions the recommendation server may determine available service providers and calculate signal quality scores for the service providers at the locations as well as an aggregate service provider score for each service provider. The recommendation server may then provide a recommendation of a service provider to the user based on the geographical positions and the weights selected by the user.

Although recommendation server is described above as pulling data on demand that is requesting data when data is desired in another example data repository may push data to recommendation server when new data becomes available. This may approximate real time data collection and analysis. As another alternative example any form of geographic information may be used to approximate the geographic position occurred e.g. cell tower information user activities that provide indications of the geographic position e.g. queries submitted by the user applications executed by the user or other such information. The functionality of data repository may in some examples be implemented by separate communicatively coupled computing devices e.g. by having dedicated devices for storing data mining the data serving the data and other dedicated devices.

In some examples such as where a mobile device provides an application programming interface API for making and or receiving calls with information about for example transfer rates dropped calls or other call information a system may gather information regarding voice signal quality data in addition to the examples discussed in this disclosure regarding data signal quality. For example the Google Voice application may be used to collect and distribute voice signal quality data to a central data repository.
