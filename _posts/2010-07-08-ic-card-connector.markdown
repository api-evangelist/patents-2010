The present invention relates to an IC integrated circuit card connector comprising a combined card accommodation portion.

Generally the functionalities of electronic devices are extended variously by attaching IC cards such as SD secure digital cards and MEMORY STICK DUO trademark cards to the electronic devices through IC card connectors. In order to allow multiple IC cards of different shapes to be inserted and used in one electronic device IC card connectors having a card slot common to the IC cards and a combined card accommodation portion which the IC cards are selectively detachable and attachable on a one by one basis has been proposed for example as shown in Patent Literature 1.

In such an IC card connector including the combined card accommodation portion card accommodation portion are formed to extend in a direction in which the IC cards are attached or detached and are hierarchically formed each other while partially overlapping each other. For example as shown in FIGS. 33 to 35 of Patent Literature 1 the card accommodation portions are separated by a partition which is pressed down by a card guide when an SD card is mounted. A part of each card accommodation portion is individually provided with a group of contact terminals corresponding to contact pads of each IC card. Soldered fixed terminals of the contact terminals in each contact terminal group are press fitted into and supported by a common rear wall forming the card accommodation portion. Moreover the contact terminals have their respective contact portions to come into contact with the contact pads of each IC card when the IC card is mounted to the combined card accommodation portion and the contact portions all extend in the same direction toward the common card slot.

Furthermore for example as shown in a relationship between a MEMORY STICK PRO DUO trademark card and a MEMORY STICK PRO HG DUO trademark card in case that a plurality of IC cards different from each other in data transfer rates some of IC cards have the same outer dimensions but are equipped with electrode pads in different arrangements among them. Even the IC cards in the above case may be sometimes required to be mounted to a common card accommodation portion in a common card connector.

Suppose a case of configuring the above described combined card accommodation portion such that a MEMORY STICK PRO Duo trademark card and a MEMORY STICK PRO HG Duo trademark card for example can be selectively mounted to one of the common accommodation portions. In this case the card accommodation portion formed below the partition as described above needs to be provided therein with contact terminals essential for both the MEMORY STICK PRO Duo trademark and MEMORY STICK PRO HG Duo trademark cards in common as well as contact terminals essential only for the MEMORY STICK PRO HG Duo trademark card.

In this case also when the above described SD card is mounted the partition pressed down by the card guide comes into contact with the contact portions of the contact terminals essential only for the MEMORY STICK PRO HG Duo trademark card.

Hereby the partition is raised by the contact terminals in contact with the partition whereby the contact terminals for SD card might fail to obtain proper contact force at their contact portions or the contact terminals for MEMORY STICK card or the partition might be deformed.

Moreover if notches holes and the like allowing the contact portions of the contact terminals to be selectively inserted therein when the partition is pressed down are formed in the partition for the purpose of preventing the contact portions of the contact terminals from coming into contact with the pressed down partition the strength of the partition could be impaired. As a result when a MEMORY STICK PRO Duo trademark card or a MEMORY STICK PRO HG Duo trademark card is mounted the deformation of the partition due to the strength poverty might be not able to obtain the contact force being properly produced at the contact portions of the contact terminals for MEMORY STICK card.

In view of the above described problem the present invention aims to provide an IC card connector having a combined card accommodation portion. The IC card connector can accommodate IC cards having the same outer dimensions but having different arrangements of electrode pads in a common card accommodation portion and provide electric connection between an electronic device and an IC card mounted in the IC card connector with proper contact force at the contact portions of the contact terminals.

To achieve the above described object the IC card connector according to the present invention comprises an IC card accommodation portion having an upper section configured to detachably attachably accommodate a first IC card therein and a lower section formed below the upper section via a partition member forming a bottom of the upper section and configured to detachably attachably accommodate a second IC card therein the second IC card being either of two types of IC cards having data transfer rates different from each other and having a plurality of electrode pads arranged in a layout different from that of electrode pads of the first IC card and arranged at same distance common to the two types of IC cards a first contact terminal group provided in the upper section and configured to be electrically connected to the electrode pads of the first IC card and a second contact terminal group provided in the lower section and configured to be electrically connected to the electrode pads of the second IC card wherein when the first IC card or the second IC card is mounted in the upper section or the lower section of the IC card accommodation portion end portions of the first and second IC cards which are exposed from an end of the IC card accommodation portion have a generally same length each other.

According to the IC card connector of the present invention the IC card accommodation portion has an upper section configured to detachably attachably accommodate a first IC card therein and a lower section formed below the upper section across a partition member forming a bottom of the upper section and configured to detachably attachably accommodate a second IC card therein the second IC card being either of two types of IC cards having data transfer rates different from each other and having multiple electrode pads arranged in a layout different from that of electrode pads of the first IC card and arranged at the same distance common to the two types of IC cards. When the first IC card or the second IC card is mounted in the upper section or the lower section of the IC card accommodation portion end portions of the first and second IC cards which are exposed from an end of the IC card accommodation portion have the generally same length. Accordingly the IC cards having the same outer dimensions but different arrangements of electrode pads can be accommodated in the common card accommodation portion. Moreover the partition member forms the bottom of the upper section and therefore does not move when the first and second cards are attached or detached. Accordingly the IC card mounted in the IC card connector can be electrically connected to the electronic device by proper contact force at the contact portions of the contact terminals.

The IC card connector shown in is provided within a predetermined electronic equipment for example a mobile phone a PDA or a camera or the like.

The IC card connector shown in is configured to electrically connect an electrode of one of for example memory cards as IC cards to be detachably attachably accommodated in a card accommodation portion of the IC card connector to a connection terminal portion of a board PB which is for input and output of signals or the like and is provided within the predetermined electronic device the memory cards being for example an SD CARD secure digital card trademark SDC see as a first IC card and a MEMORY STICK PRO HG DUO trademark card see as a second IC card. Note that instead of the MEMORY STICK PRO HG DUO trademark card hereinafter also referred to as an HG Duo card it is possible to mount detachably attachably for example a memory card referred to as a MEMORY STICK PRO DUO trademark card hereinafter referred to as a Duo card see which has the same outer dimensions as those of the MEMORY STICK PRO HG DUO trademark card.

It should be noted that the IC card is not limited to the aforementioned SD card and may be selected from MMC multimedia card CARDs trademark flash memories memory cards incorporating microdrive and the like.

The SD card SDC has a thickness of about 2.1 mm and is about 32 mm and about 24 mm in length and width respectively for example. The longitudinal and width dimensions of the HG Duo card are smaller than the longitudinal and width dimensions of the SD card SDC.

The plate shaped HG Duo card includes a front face A and a back face B opposite to each other for example as shown in . Note that shows only the back face B of the HG Duo card . Moreover the HG Duo card has a chamfer portion at a corner of the tip.

In the back face B of the HG Duo card a comparatively shallow recess portion is formed adjacent to the chamfer portion . There is a protrusion of a predetermined length formed along a side surface of the HG Duo card around the recess portion

Moreover a run out portion is provided at a predetermined distance away from the protrusion in the side surface of the HG Duo card . The run out portion is thinner than the other part.

In the front end of the back face B of the HG Duo card multiple recesses are formed substantially in parallel to the long side of the HG Duo card at predetermined intervals away from the recess portion toward the center of the HG Duo card . Each of recess is configured to set the same width and the same length in the longitudinal direction of the HG Duo card . The recesses adjacent to each other are comparted by partition walls and between the recess located at an end of the row of the recesses and the recess portion are comparted by a partition wall.

In a contact pad as an electrode is provided on the bottom surface of the first recess closest to the recess portion . On the bottom surface of the second recess adjacent to the first recess a contact pad of the same length as the contact pad is provided. On the bottom surface of the third recess divided contact pads and are arranged in a line with a predetermined gap therebetween. On the bottom surface of the fifth recess divided contact pads and are arranged in a line with a predetermined gap therebetween. On the bottom surface of the sixth recess a contact pad of the same length as the contact pad is provided. On the bottom surface of the seventh recess divided contact pads and are arranged in a line with a predetermined gap therebetween. On the bottom surfaces of the eighth to tenth recesses contact pads and of the same length as the contact pad are provided respectively. Respective end portions Ef of the contact pads to fronting the front end of the HG Duo card are arranged in a common straight line parallel to the short side of the HG Duo card . In addition end portions Er of the contact pads and to fronting the rear end of the HG Duo card are also arranged in a common straight line parallel to the short side of the HG Duo card .

In A and B reference numerals to are expediently given for convenience to describe the correspondent relationship between the contact pads of the IC card and a plurality of contact terminals see .

The plate shaped Duo card has a front face A and a back face B opposite to each other for example as enlarged in . Note that shows only the back face B of the Duo card . Moreover the Duo card has a chamfer portion at a corner of the tip.

In the back face B of the Duo card a comparatively shallow recess portion is formed adjacent to the chamfer portion . There is a protrusion of a predetermined length formed along a side surface of the Duo card around the recess portion

Moreover a run out portion is provided at a predetermined distance away from the protrusion in the side surface of the Duo card . The run out portion is thinner than the other parts.

In the front end of the back face B of the Duo card multiple recesses are formed substantially in parallel to the long side of the Duo card at predetermined intervals away from the recess portion toward the center of the Duo card . The recesses are configured to set the same width and the same length in the longitudinal direction of the Duo card . The recesses adjacent to each other are comparted by partition walls and between the recess located at an end of the row of the recesses and the recess portion are comparted by a partition wall.

In a contact pad as an electrode is provided on the bottom surface of the first recess closest to the recess portion . On the bottom surfaces of the second to tenth recesses contact pads and of the same length as the contact pad are provided respectively. End portions Ef of the contact pads to fronting the front end of the Duo card and end portions Er thereof fronting the rear end of the Duo card are arranged in respective common straight lines parallel to the short side of the Duo card . Note that a distance L from a front face of the Duo card to the rear end portions Er of the contact pads to is shorter than a distance L from a front face of the High Duo card to the rear end portions of the contact pads and to . In other words the length of the contact pads to of the Duo card is set shorter than the length of the contact pads and of the HG Duo card as shown in .

As shown in the IC card connector comprises a base member in which multiple contact terminals electrically connected to the accommodated SD card SDC HG Duo card or Duo card are arranged and a cover member for forming a combined card accommodation portion for the IC cards in cooperation with the base member .

The cover member having a gate like cross sectional shape is formed from a sheet metal. In both side surface portions of the cover member engagement holes not shown configured to be engaged with nib portions to of the base member shown in are formed corresponding to the nib portions to . Accordingly the cover member is fixed to the base member by engaging the engagement holes with the nib portions to of the base member .

In addition as shown in a leaf spring is provided near one of the both side surface portions of the cover member in the upper surface portion of the cover member connecting the side surface portions. The leaf spring movably supports a cam lever L of a later described eject mechanism . A proximal end portion of the leaf spring having resilience is integrally formed with the cover member . The leaf spring is formed for example by performing press working to stamp out a part of the cover member toward the inside. Accordingly there is an opening formed around the portion of the cover member corresponding to the leaf spring

As shown in a card accommodation portion of the base member is open at the top and an end opposite to a contact terminal fixed portion. As shown in the card accommodation portion is a combined card accommodation portion which accommodates the SD card SDC in the upper section U and the HG Duo card or Duo card in the lower section D the upper and lower sections U and D partially overlapping each other.

Therefore as shown in the base member is covered with the aforementioned cover member to form a common card slot in an end portion of the card accommodation portion. The common card slot allows one of the SD card SDC HG Duo card and the Duo card to be selectively passed therethrough.

The open end portion as the common card slot has a stepped cross section corresponding to the shapes of the SD card SDC HG Duo card and the Duo card to be inserted although illustration thereof is omitted.

The open end portion is formed of a first guide portion which has a substantially rectangular cross section and through which the HG Duo card and the Duo card are passed a second guide portion which has such a cross section that large and small substantial rectangles are stacked each other and through which the SD card SDC is passed and paired inclined portions each of which connects an upper end of the first guide portion and a lower end of the second guide portion.

This allows front ends of the SD card SDC and the HG Duo card and the Duo card in a forward direction to be guided by the second guide portion and the first guide portion and passed toward the upper and lower sections respectively.

The base member is integrally molded with a mold resin material for example. As shown in the base member comprises sidewalls RW and LW which individually form both side portions of the card accommodation portion in which the SD card SDC the HG Duo card and the Duo card are detachably accommodated a contact terminal fixing wall FW in which contact terminals i 1 to 14 for the HG Duo card and the Duo card and contact terminals i 1 to 9 for the SD card SDC are disposed.

As shown in the nib portions and are formed at predetermined intervals in the outer surface of the sidewall LW corresponding to the aforementioned engagement holes of the cover member . The similar nib portions and are also formed at predetermined intervals in the outer surface of the sidewall RW corresponding to the aforementioned engagement holes of the cover member .

For example as shown in a plurality of contact terminals are arranged at predetermined intervals in a portion of the card accommodation portion near the contact terminal fixing wall FW the upper section U so as to extend substantially in parallel to the sidewalls RW and LW.

In contrast the contact terminals are arranged at predetermined intervals in a portion of the card accommodation portion near the contact terminal fixing wall FW in the lower section D which is located under the upper section U so as to extend substantially in parallel to the sidewalls RW and LW. Between the upper section U and the lower section D are separated by a partition integrally formed with and fixed to the contact terminal fixing wall FW as shown in . The flat partition is formed substantially in parallel to the bottom surface of the base member and the end thereof on the card slot side extends into a region where a later described improper insertion restraint member rotates. The partition has slits i 1 to 8 see into which ends of the contact portions of the contact terminals are pressed down and inserted when the SD card SDC is inserted are inserted as shown in .

The ends of the contact portions of the contact terminals are arranged so as not to come into contact with some of the contact terminals provided under the slits

Because the thickness of the partition can be therefore made thin and the aforementioned structure is effective in downsizing of the connector.

At the peripheries of predetermined ones of the slits protrusion pieces for preventing improper insertion are formed so as to protrude toward the cover member by a predetermined height. The protrusion pieces are configured to limit the insertion of the SD card SDC by coming into contact with the end of the SD card SDC inserted in a improper direction. Accordingly the protrusion pieces prevent so called reversed insertion or opposite insertion of the SD card SDC.

Each of the contact terminals comprises a resilient contact portion which is configured to come into contact with one of the contact pads of the SD card SDC to be electrically connected thereto a soldered portion which is soldered to the electrode of the wiring board PB to be electrically connected thereto and a fixed portion which connects the contact portion and the soldered portion and is fixed to the base member . The fixed portion of each contact terminal is made of a sheet metal of metallic material for example phosphor bronze for spring. Although not shown in the drawings the fixed portion of the contact terminal is fixed to the base member by being press fitted into a groove formed in the contact terminal fixing wall FW through a through hole formed in the contact terminal fixing wall FW in a direction opposite to the inserting direction of the SD card SDC.

Each of the contact terminals i 1 to 14 comprises a resilient contact portion which is configured to come into contact with one of the contact pads of the HG Duo card and the Duo card to be electrically connected thereto a soldered portion which is soldered and fixed to the electrode of the aforementioned wiring board to be electrically connected thereto and a fixed portion which interconnects the contact portion and the soldered portion and is fixed to the base member . The contact terminals are formed by insert molding together with the base member . The soldered portions of the contact terminals protrude from the end of the contact terminal fixing wall FW as shown in and are arranged in a line. The soldered portions of the aforementioned contact terminals are each disposed between two adjacent contact terminals and two adjacent contact terminals as shown .

A first ground line terminal in the contact terminals is provided in a bottom portion of the card accommodation portion formed at the closest position to the side wall RW. The first ground line terminal has a contact portion which is configured to come into contact with the contact pad of the HG Duo card or the contact pad of the Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

A data transfer line terminal is adjacent to the first ground line terminal at a predetermined distance away from the side wall RW. The overall length of the data transfer line terminal is set shorter than the overall length of the first ground line terminal .

In addition the data transfer line contact terminal has a contact portion which is configured to come into contact with the contact pad of the HG Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

The overall length of a card detection line terminal adjacent to the data transfer line terminal is set generally equal to the overall length of a first ground line terminal . However the card detection line terminal is located so that the position of the contact portion of the card detection line terminal is closer to the contact terminal fixing wall FW than that of the contact portion of the first ground line terminal . The card detection line terminal has a contact portion which is configured to come into contact with the contact pad of the HG Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

Three data transfer line terminals and are arranged side by side in adjacent to the card detection line terminal . The three data transfer line terminals have the same structure as each other and have contact portions configured to come into contact with the contact pads and of the HG Duo card to be electrically connected thereto respectively. The overall lengths of the data transfer line terminals and are set to be the same as each other. Accordingly the positions of the contact portions of the data transfer line terminals and are set closest to the card slot among the contact portions of all the contact terminals.

Meanwhile when the Duo card is inserted and held the data transfer line terminals and are not used as the contact portions electrically connected thereto. The data transfer line terminals and are therefore not brought into contact with the contact pads to and of the Duo card . The data transfer line terminals and are not limited to such an example but may be configured to come into contact with the contact pads to and of the Duo card for example.

A second ground line contact terminal has the same structure as the structure of the aforementioned first ground line terminal and has a contact portion which is configured to come into contact with the contact pad of the HG Duo card or the contact pad of the Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

In the contact terminal fixing wall FW seven contact terminals are provided such that these contact terminals are arranged at predetermined intervals generally in parallel to the sidewalls RW and LW. The seven contact terminals have the same structure as each other. For example the power line terminal most closely adjacent to the first ground line terminal has a contact portion which is configured to come into contact with the contact pad of the HG Duo card or the contact pad of the Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

Other contact terminals to adjacent to each other in this order include contact portions which are configured to come into contact with the respective contact pads and of the HG Duo card or the respective contact pads and of the Duo card to be electrically connected thereto.

The overall length of a terminal is set so that the contact portion of the first ground line terminal is placed between the terminal and the sidewall RW so as to overlap the terminal on the common plane.

The contact terminals and are arranged on the common lines as the aforementioned data transfer line contact terminals and so as to be opposed to the same with predetermined gaps therebetween respectively. As shown in there are improper insertion preventing walls formed near the contact portions of the contact terminals and so as to protrude from the bottoms. Each of the improper insertion preventing walls is formed to have a width slightly narrower than those of the contact pads of the aforementioned HG Duo card and the Duo card . Moreover the improper insertion preventing walls are lower than the heights from the back portion B of the HG Duo card and the back portion B of the Duo card and higher than the height positions of the contact portions of the contact terminals and respectively. Accordingly if the HG Duo card and the Duo card are inserted into the card accommodation portion in a improper direction the improper insertion preventing walls can come into contact with the leading edges of the HG Duo card and the Duo card to prevent the HG Duo card and the Duo card from being inserted further. This can prevent the contact terminals from being destroyed by the HG Duo card and the Duo card .

Comparing the terminals and with the data transfer line terminals and the data transfer line terminals and are formed so that the overall length and width thereof are larger than the overall length and the width of the contact terminals respectively. This allows the contact portions of the contact terminals provided on the common line to be subjected to equal predetermined contact pressure applied by the contact pads of the HG Duo card .

The overall length of the terminal is set so that the contact portion of the second ground line terminal is placed between the terminal and the sidewall LW so as to overlap the terminal on the common plane.

Accordingly in the lower section D of the card accommodation portion one IC card which is either the HG Duo card or the Duo card is detachably attachably loaded.

As shown in an eject mechanism is provided on the inside of the sidewall RW. The eject mechanism is configured to hold one IC card which is the SD card SDC the HG Duo card or the Duo card and to selectively eject the one IC card among them from the card accommodation portion.

The eject mechanism comprises an ejector member J which is movably supported by the base member and is configured to selectively hold the SD card SDC or the like a coil spring S which is provided between a wall adjacent to the contact terminal fixing wall FW of the base member and the ejector member J and is configured to urge the ejector member J in an ejecting direction of the SD card SDC and an ejector member controller. The ejector member controller is configured to make a control that selectively holds or releases the ejector member J from the base member according to an operation of attaching or detaching the SD card SDC.

Also as shown in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2004 311416 for example the ejector member controller comprises a cam element HC heart cam which is formed in a part of the ejector member J on the sidewall RW side and has a generally heart shape see a lever guide groove JG which is formed by multiple step heights formed around the heart cam and the gate shaped cam lever L see and the above described leaf spring of the cover member see . One end of the cam lever L is connected to a hole of the sidewall RW and the other end of the cam lever is made to slide along the lever guide groove JG.

The leaf spring is configured to urge a bent tip of the cam lever L so that the bent tip of the cam lever L touches and slides on the guide surface of the lever guide groove. An end portion of the cam lever L therefore follows the action of the ejector member J to be guided sequentially through each guide groove constituting the lever guide groove JG. Once the end portion of the cam lever L held by the cam surface formed on the heart cam HC the ejector member J accompanied with the SD card SDC or the like is thus held in the card accommodation portion. And then when the end of the cam lever L is away from the cam surface by further push in operation of the SD card SDC or the like the ejector member J accompanied with the SD card SDC or the like is made to move in the card ejecting direction by the urging force of the coil spring S.

As shown enlarged in the ejector member J has a first card receiving portion Ja adjacent to the heart cam HC in its upper end portion. The first card receiving portion Ja is configured to receive an inclined chamfer portion in the front end portion of the SD card SDC positioned in the upper section U in . Under the card receiving portion Ja of the ejector member a second card receiving portion JS is formed. The second card receiving portion JS is configured to receive a corner of the front end portion of the HG Duo card or the Duo card opposite to the chamfer portion or when the HG Duo card or the Duo card is positioned in the lower section D in .

Furthermore on the inside of the sidewalls RW and LW forming a part of the card slot in the card accommodation portion a card improper insertion preventing mechanism is provided. The card improper insertion preventing mechanism has a structure similar to the structure shown in Japanese Patent Laid open No. 2007 165011 for example and comprises a improper insertion restraint member a pair of lock members R and L for locking or unlocking the improper insertion restraint member and torsion springs for urging the improper insertion restraint member in one direction as shown in . The improper insertion restraint member is configured to prevent the improper entry of the HG Duo card and the Duo card into the contact terminals by coming into contact with the end of the inserted HG Duo card and the Duo card in the forward direction.

The improper insertion restraint member formed such as a crank has shaft portions at both ends and a connecting portion interconnecting the shaft portions in the center portion.

The cylindrical shaft portions are rotational movably supported by bearing portions formed within the card accommodation portion in the base member . The radial movements of the shaft portions are limited by arc portions of later described movable pieces Rm and Lm of the lock members R and L. The torsion springs are wound around the circumferences of the shaft portions. An end of each of the torsion springs is fixed to an end of the improper insertion restraint member and the other end thereof is fixed to the sidewall of the base member . The improper insertion restraint member is therefore urged in a direction indicated by an arrow F in that is around the shaft portion in the clockwise direction as the ejecting direction of the SD card SDC.

The aforementioned connecting portion has a touching surface which the inserted SD card SDC or the HG Duo card and the Duo card touch at an end in a longitudinal direction thereof. In a portion of the touching surface in the left end a recess with a predetermined depth and a predetermined inclination not shown is formed in the longitudinal direction extending a predetermined length.

At the both ends of the connecting portion interconnecting the shaft portions notches are individually formed such that the notches are fixed with peripheral edges of openings not shown of the later described movable pieces Rm and Lm of the lock members R and L. The notches are formed at the end surface of the aforementioned connecting portion opposed to a touching surface. In other words hook like engagement portions ER and EL configured to be engaged with the peripheral edges of the aforementioned openings of the movable pieces Rm and Lm are formed at the both ends of the connecting portion.

The paired lock members R and L have the same structure as each other. Accordingly a description is given to the lock member R and the description of the lock member L is omitted.

The lock member R comprises a fixed piece press fitted into a straight groove formed in the sidewall RW of the base member and the movable piece Rm integrally formed at an end of the fixed piece.

In a portion of the movable piece Rm continuous to an end of the fixed piece a curvature is formed so as to bulge into the region where a side portion of the SD card SDC passes. Hereby the distance between the curvature of the lock member R and a curvature of the lock member L opposite to the lock member R is therefore slightly smaller than the width of the SD card SDC and larger than the widths of the HG Duo card and the Duo card .

At an end of the movable piece Rm the rectangular opening not shown is formed into which the engagement portion ER of the aforementioned improper insertion restraint member is inserted. There is a predetermined gap between the peripheral edge of the opening portion and the outer circumference of the engagement portion ER so that the end of the movable piece Rm can move. Moreover a stopper piece for restraint the initial position of the movable piece Rm is provided adjacent to the curvature of the movable piece Rm.

Hereby when the side portions of the SD card SDC pass between the curvatures of the lock members R and L opposite to each other the curvatures are pressed by the both side portions of the SD card SDC to separate the opening of the movable piece Rm from the engagement portion ER of the improper insertion restraint member . The lock members R and L thus unlock the improper insertion restraint member .

On the other hand when the pressed curvatures of the lock members R and L opposite to each other is changed from the pressed state to a non pressed state for example when the SD card SDC is ejected from the card accommodation portion the movable piece Rm returns to the aforementioned initial position due to the restoring force of the curvature. The aforementioned opening is therefore inserted into the engagement portion ER of the improper insertion restraint member urged and rotational moved by the urging force of the torsion spring . The lock members R and L thus lock the improper insertion restraint member again as in the initial state.

In such a structure when the SD card SDC is mounted in the card accommodation portion the front end of the SD card SDC going through the card slot presses the curvatures of the lock members R and L opposite to each other in a separation direction. Accordingly the openings of the movable pieces Rm and Lm are separated from the engagement portions ER and EL of the improper insertion restraint member . The improper insertion restraint member is thus unlocked.

Next if the front end of the SD card SDC is further inserted in the forward direction the improper insertion restraint member is rotationally moved against the urging force of the torsion springs with the front end of the SD card SDC touching to the touching surface of the improper insertion restraint member . Accordingly the front end of the SD card SDC goes over the improper insertion restraint member and is held at a predetermined position by the ejector member J. A rear end of the SD card SDC is therefore protruded from the card slot by a predetermined length L as shown in .

On the other hand when the SD card SDC is taken out from the card accommodation portion the SD card SDC is slightly further pressed into the card accommodation portion. The SD card SDC is then moved in the eject direction together with the eject member J due to the urging force of the coil spring S of the eject mechanism.

At that time the improper insertion restraint member is rotationally moved toward the card slot due to the urging force of the torsion coil springs and the opening of the movable piece Rm of the lock member R and the opening of the movable piece Lm of the lock member L which are opposite to each other are returned by the restoring force thereof to the positions facing the engagement portions ER and EL and are inserted respectively. The improper insertion restraint member is again returned to the initial locked state.

When either of the HG Duo card and the Duo card is mounted into a normal position of the card accommodation portion as shown in the front end of the inserted HG Duo card goes through the guide portions of the card slot and then between the curvatures of the lock members R and L opposite to each other and then goes under the connecting portion of the improper insertion restraint member to be introduced to the lower section D as a lower normal position of the card accommodation portion. At that time the front end of the HG Duo card is held at a predetermined position by the above described second card receiving portion JS. Accordingly as shown in a rear end of the HG Duo card is protruded from the card slot by a predetermined length L generally equal to the protruding length L of the aforementioned SD card SDC see .

In such a case at the time when the HG Duo card is inserted into the card accommodation portion through the card slot the contact pads and of the HG Duo card start to come into slidingly contact with the data transfer line terminals and respectively. Subsequently the contact portion of the first ground line terminal and the contact portion of the second ground line terminal then come into contact with the contact pads and of the HG Duo card respectively.

On the other hand when the HG Duo card is taken out from the card accommodation portion the HG Duo card is then made to be moved in the eject direction together with the second card receiving portion JS due to the urging force of the coil spring S of the eject mechanism owing to the HG Duo card being slightly further pushed into the card accommodation portion.

If the HG Duo card is accidentally inserted with an end of the card where the contact pads are not formed facing the forward direction first the leading edge comes into contact with the touching surface of the improper insertion restraint member and the movable piece Lm is therefore separated from the stopper piece and the engagement portion EL of the improper insertion restraint member thus unlocking the improper insertion restraint member upon pressing the curvature of the lock member L by the left side of the leading edge.

Next when the touching surface of the unlocked improper insertion restraint member is further pressed against the urging force of the torsion springs by the end portion of the HG Duo card in the forward direction the urging force of the torsion springs becomes equal to the restoring force of the movable piece Lm and the improper insertion restraint member is held with the end face of the engagement portion EL touched to the movable piece Lm. At that time the engagement portion ER of the improper insertion restraint member is rotated so that a part of the notch fit to the peripheral edge of the opening. Accordingly since the engagement portion ER is not unlocked the improper insertion restraint member prevents the improper insertion of the HG Duo card .
