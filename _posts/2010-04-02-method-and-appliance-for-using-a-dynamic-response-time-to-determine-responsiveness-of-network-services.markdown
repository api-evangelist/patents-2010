The present application claims priority and is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 462 344 A Method and Appliance for Using a Dynamic Response Time to Determine Responsiveness of Network Services filed Aug. 3 2006 and now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 720 954 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to a method and appliance for using a dynamic response time to determine responsiveness of one or more network services.

Conventional systems provide functionality for determining responsiveness of servers to network requests. Typically static response times are defined by an administrator. If a server fails to respond to a request within the allocated response time the server may be identified as an unavailable server. Such a system would not typically accommodate variations in response time due to increased load or type of request.

Nor would such a system typically have the flexibility to support different response times needed when responding to requests for different servers or network services on different servers. For example in a system providing a plurality of network services on a plurality of servers the system may support only one static response time while the network services require varying amounts of time to respond to different types of requests. Some servers or network services on servers may be available but require additional time than that allotted by the pre determined static response time. These servers or network services may be identified as unavailable although they are available.

A system supporting a variable response time and providing accurate identification of the availability of one of a plurality of network services or servers having varying average response times would be desirable

In one aspect the present solution is directed to a method for determining responsiveness of a service via a particular protocol. A device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of services determines response times from each of a plurality of services to respond to requests via a first type of protocol of a plurality of protocols. The device calculates an average response time for the first type of protocol from each of the response times of the plurality of services. The device establishes a predetermined threshold for which a response time of a service for the first type of protocol may deviate from the average response time. The device identifies a service as available responsive to determining that a deviation of the response time of the service from the average response falls within the predetermined threshold.

In some embodiments the device may determine response times using a protocol specific probe. A protocol specific probe may determine response times from an HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP service to an HTTP command. The device may also determine that a response includes expected content from the HTTP command.

In various embodiments the device may determine the average response time over a predetermined learning period. The device may update the average response time at predetermined intervals. Further the device may generate a first response time average for a first plurality of response times and a second response time average for a second plurality of response times and determine the average response time by averaging the first response time average and the second response time average.

In additional embodiments the device may identify a second service as unavailable responsive to determining that a deviation of the response time of the second service from the average response exceeds the predetermined threshold. The device may exclude the response time of the second service from the average response time while the second service is unavailable. Further the device may specify the predetermined threshold as a percentage of deviation.

In another aspect the present solution is directed to a system for determining responsiveness of a service via a particular protocol. The system includes one or more monitors of a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of services determining response times from each of a plurality of services to respond to requests via a first type of protocol of a plurality of protocols and calculating an average response time for the first type of protocol from each of the response times of the plurality of services. The device establishes a predetermined threshold for which a response time of a service for the first type of protocol may deviate from the average response time and identifies a service as available responsive to determining that a deviation of the response time of the service from the average response falls within the predetermined threshold.

The one or more monitors may determine the response times using a protocol specific probe. Protocol specific probes may determine response times from an HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP service to an HTTP command. Further protocol specific probes may determine that a response includes expected content from the HTTP command.

The device may determine the average response time over a predetermined learning period. Additionally the device may update the average response time at predetermined intervals. In some embodiments the device generates a first response time average for a first plurality of response times and a second response time average for a second plurality of response times and determines the average response time by averaging the first response time average and the second response time average. The device may identify a second service as unavailable responsive to determining that a deviation of the response time of the second service from the average response exceeds the predetermined threshold. The device may exclude the response time of the second service from the average response time while the second service is unavailable. In some embodiments the predetermined threshold is specified as a percentage of deviation.

The details of various embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

The features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference characters identify corresponding elements throughout. In the drawings like reference numbers generally indicate identical functionally similar and or structurally similar elements.

In some embodiments including a server farm comprising servers one or more of the servers share common resources. In one of these embodiments a common resource is a physical device such as a back end database accessed by a plurality of the servers to provide functionality to one or more clients. In another of these embodiments a user such as an administrator of the shared resource determines a static response timeout for the one or more servers and of the shared resource. In another of these embodiments the shared resource responds to requests but requires a response time greater than the statically determined response time set by the user to respond to requests of the servers. In still another of these embodiments a server requiring a response from the shared resource to respond to a client request would also require a response time greater than the statically determined response time. In some of these embodiments a monitor of the shared resource would identify the shared resource and the server as unavailable due to the increased response time required.

In alternate embodiments such as those depicted and described below in connection with a dynamic response time is configured by monitoring response times and determining average response times. In one of these embodiments a service response time is determined as a function of average response time and of deviation from average response times. In another of these embodiments an average response time and a predetermined threshold are identified. In still another of these embodiments a service is identified as unavailable when it exceeds the average response time by the predetermined threshold. In yet another of these embodiments the use of the predetermined threshold and the average response times improves the accuracy of an identification of a service as unavailable and increases the functionality of a monitor identifying unavailable services.
