title: Matching data based on numeric difference
abstract: Systems and methods for matching data based on numeric difference are described herein. Input data elements are parsed to identify a first number and a second number. A difference between the first number and the second number is calculated based on a predefined formula. Based on the difference, a matching score between the input data elements is evaluated. The matching score is proportional to a base matching score corresponding to a threshold difference, and a maximum score corresponding to a match between the first number and the second number. A similarity between the input data elements is reported based on the evaluated matching score.
