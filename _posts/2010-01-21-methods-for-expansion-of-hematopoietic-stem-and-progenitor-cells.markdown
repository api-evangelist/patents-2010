This application is a 35 U.S.C. 371 National Phase Entry Application of International Application No. PCT US2010 21638 filed Jan. 21 2010 which designates the United States and which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of the U.S. provisional application No. 61 145 989 filed Jan. 21 2009 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. R01 HL65909 12 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPC self renew and differentiate to form all blood cells throughout animal life. The hematopoietic system is composed of many different cell types at various stages of maturity. HSCs give rise to all the blood cell types including myeloid monocytes and macrophages neutrophils basophils eosinophils erythrocytes megakaryocytes platelets dendritic cells and lymphoid lineages T cells B cells NK cells .

As stem cells they are defined by their ability to form multiple cell types multipotency and their ability to self renew. It is known that a small number of HSCs can expand to generate a very large number of progeny HSCs. This phenomenon is used in bone marrow transplant when a small number of HSCs reconstitute the hematopoietic system. The ability to self renew and differentiate to form all blood cells provides a constant supply of blood cells throughout animal life. The supply is needed for replacing old worn out or dead blood cells in the body.

The intricate balance between the two characteristic self renewal and differentiation stem cell states is required for maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis and for responding to tissue injury. Stem cell population size is tightly regulated and thought to be dictated by rates of proliferation relative frequency of differentiative versus self renewal outcomes and apoptosis. Disruption of any of these processes could lead to stem cell exhaustion or increased risk of leukemogenesis 1 5 . However the molecular events specifying stem cell population size are still poorly understood. Identifying the genes and pathways that regulate self renewal and differentiation in HSCs can provide ways to regulate stem cell fate and the development of conditions that would enable amplification of transplantable HSCs.

Embodiments of the present invention are based on the discovery that small hairpin RNAs or short hairpin RNAs shRNA that target six proteins when transduced into an isolated cell population of primary HSPCs increased the colony forming capacity and the long term culture forming capacity of the HSPCs. The transduced isolated cell population of primary HSPCs scored two to five fold higher in a standard methylcellulose colony forming cell assay CFC and over 100 fold higher in a standard long term culture initiating cell assay LTC IC . The target six proteins are exostoses 1 EXT1 phospholipase C zeta 1 PLCZ1 serine threonine kinase 38 STK38 protein tyrosine phosphatase non receptor type 9 PTPN9 egl nine homolog 3 EGLN3 mutL homolog 1 MLH1 and ATP binding cassette sub family C CFTR MRP member 12 ABCC12 . Accordingly inhibiting the protein activity and or the protein expression of EXT1 STK38 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and or ABCC12 can lead to increased expansion of HSCs.

In one embodiment the RNAi agent when contacted and or transduced into an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC produces HSPCs that exhibit at least a 2 fold increase in colony formation capacity when compared to an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is not contacted with the agent or RNAi agent.

In all embodiments of the methods disclosed herein the isolated cell population comprising an HSPC contacted with the agent or RNAi agent exhibits at least a 2 fold increase in colony formation capacity when compared to an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is not contacted with the agent or RNAi agent. The isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is not contacted with the agent or RNAi agent functions as a control. In some embodiments the colony formation capacity is increased by at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 5 fold at least 5 fold at least 6 fold at least 7 fold at least 8 fold at least 9 fold or at least 10 fold when compared to a control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC. The colony formation capacity can be determined in culture by a standard methylcellulose colony forming cell assay CFC that is well known is the art and is described herein. The control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is used for the comparison is an HSPC that is contacted with only the buffer or vehicle in which the agent or RNAi agent is solubilized suspended dissolved in for example if the agent or RNAi agent is dissolved in phosphate buffer saline PBS then the vehicle is PBS. In this example the control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC is contacted with PBS and the HSPC to be expanded by the method described herein is contacted with a PBS solution containing the agent or RNAi agent. For example if the RNAi agent is dissolved in 0.1 M Tris HCL EDTA pH 8.0 buffer 1 TE then the buffer is 1 TE. In this example the control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC is contacted with 1 TE and the HSC to be expanded by the method described herein is contacted with a 1 TE solution containing the RNAi agent. For comparison purposes the contact time for both groups of HSPCs contacted with and not contacted with an agent or RNAi agent are the kept the same.

In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein the isolated cell population comprising an HSPC contacted with the agent or RNAi agent exhibits at least a 2 fold increase in the percent of CFU erythroid CFU E and burst forming units erythroid BFU E formed when compared to a control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC. In some embodiments the increase in percent of CFU erythroid CFU E and burst forming units erythroid BFU E formed is at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 5 fold at least 5 fold at least 6 fold at least 7 fold at least 8 fold at least 9 fold or at least 10 fold when compared to a control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC. The increase in percent of CFU erythroid CFU E and burst forming units erythroid BFU E formed in culture can be determined by visual assessment of the morphology of the colonies formed. The morphologies of the various colonies derived from HSPCs are well known in the art e.g. CFU granulocyte macrophage CFU GM CFU erythroid CFU E and burst forming units erythroid BFU E . The morphologies are also described herein. One skilled in the art would be able to identify the types of colony count the total number of colonies and count the numbers of CFU E and BFU E colonies. The percent of CFU E BFU E is calculated by the formula 

In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein the method is such that the isolated cell population comprising an HSPC contacted with the at least one RNAi agent exhibits at least a 5 fold increase in long term culture colony formation capacity when compared to an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is not contacted with the RNAi agent. The isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that is not contacted with the agent or RNAi agent functions as a control. In some embodiments the increase in long term culture colony formation capacity is at least 6 fold at least 7 fold at least 8 fold at least 9 fold at least 10 fold at least 11 fold at least 12 fold at least 13 fold or more fold when compared to a control isolated cell population comprising an HSPC. The in long term culture colony formation capacity can determined in culture by a standard LTC IC assay by limited dilution assay LDA that is well known is the art and is described herein.

In the methods disclosed herein expanding HSPC or expansion of HSPC means increasing or multiplying the number of cells. For example with a starting number of 1 10HSPCs contacting these HSPCs with an agent or an RNAi agent disclosed herein produces a number of HSPCs that is greater than 1 10HSPCs after a period of several weeks in culture for example at least twice the number of original number of cells. This is achieved because the HSPCs that have been contacted with an agent inhibitor or an RNAi agent disclosed herein have increased colony formation cell CFC capacity. A single HSPC with increased CFC capacity undergoes multiple cell divisions and thereby multiplies the cell number.

In some embodiments of the methods described herein the isolated cell population comprising an HSPC is contacted with the RNAi agent by simply mixing the RNAi agent with the HSPC in solution usually the RNAi agent is added into the culture medium of the HSPC. The culture medium with the RNAi agent is then added to the HSPCs. For example siRNA dsRNA micro RNA shRNA short interfering oligonucleotide short interfering nucleic acid precursors or derivatives thereof a vector an expression vector a lentivirus or adenovirus is added to the culture medium of a culture dish containing the HSPCs. In other embodiments the RNAi agent is mixed with other carriers such as polymers PEG fusion PTD DRBD protein and added to the HSPCs. For example where the RNAi agent is an expression vector it can be mixed with transfection reagents such as LIPOFECTAMINE . Such transfection reagents help the RNAi agent enter the cells.

In one embodiment the expression vector can be a virus such as an adenovirus an adeno associated virus or lentivirus for example MDH.xdna murine retroviral vector. Viral vectors provide an additional advantage of ease of transducing the HSPCs by viral infection. In another embodiment the expression vector is a non viral vector. Such vectors can be transfected into HSPCs using known transfection methods known in the art such as cationic lipid transfection as disclosed herein.

In one embodiment isolation and culturing of progenitor cells is performed using the methods well known in to those skilled in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 199 942 5 474 687 5 589 368 5 612 211 5 905 041 6 355 237 and 7 345 025 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. The identity of the isolated HSPCs can be confirmed by transglutaminase expression in culture as described in WO2000 006766 which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. After in vitro transfection the transfected HSPCs can be expanded in culture according to methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 744 361 5 905 041 and 6 326 198 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Nos. 5 817 773 5 858 782 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 730 334 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment of any of the methods disclosed herein the method comprises stimulating the ex vivo expansion of the isolated cell population comprising HSPCs before contacting with the agent or RNAi agent.

Nat. Med. 2006 12 240 5 Zhang C C et al. Blood. 2008 111 3415 23 Huynh H et al. Stem Cells. 2008 26 1628 35 North T E et al. Nature. 2007 447 1007 11 . Methods of expanding stem cells in vitro are known in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 728 581 5 908 784 and U.S. Patent Application 2004 0018620 2005 072147 and 2009 0148420.

These represent the minimum number of cell surface antigen matching required for transplantation.

In one embodiment the isolated cell population comprising an HSPC is cryopreserved before being contacted with the agent or RNAi agent. The HSPC is initially harvested from a donor and cryopreserved. Preferably HLA type and blood group information of the donor are recorded and cataloged with the frozen HSPCs. It is contemplated that a bank of HSPCs can be produced wherein all samples of HSPCs are cataloged by HLA type and blood group. When HSPCs of a certain HLA type and blood group is needed the frozen HSPCs can be thawed and expanded ex vivo by the methods disclosed herein. The expanded HSPCs are then collected and used e.g. for implanting into a subject.

In another embodiment the isolated cell population comprising an HPSC is contacted with the agent or RNAi agent disclosed herein grown in culture for a period of time and then the cultured and expanded ex vivo HPSCs are cryopreserved for future use e.g. implantation into the same donor the same intended recipient or another recipient.

In one embodiment described herein is a method of treating anemia in a host in need thereof the method comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In one embodiment the method disclosed herein includes monitoring the RBC count of a subject before and after the administration of the agent for treatment of anemia. The RBC count performed before treatment provide the data for a physician to make a diagnosis of anemia and the RBC count also serves as a reference number with which post treatment RBC counts can be compared. Routine RBC count of samples of peripheral blood should be performed at 1 2 3 months or on an ongoing basis e.g. every two months following treatment or according to a physician s decision in order to monitor the efficacy of the treatment.

In one embodiment the method disclosed herein comprises treating anemia in conjunction with other known treatments such as with erythropoietin EPO and peptide mimetics of EPO. EPO is a hormone produced by the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. The kidney cells that make EPO are specialized and are sensitive to low oxygen levels in the blood. These cells release EPO when the oxygen level is low in the kidney. EPO then stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red cells and thereby increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. EPO is the prime regulator of red blood cell production. Its major functions are to promote the differentiation and development of red blood cells and to initiate the production of hemoglobin the molecule within red cells that transports oxygen.

Serine threonine kinase 38 STK38 GeneID 11329 GENBANK Accession No. NM007271.2 mRNA and NP009202.1 protein catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphoryl group from ATP to serine threonine residues on protein substrates. Synonyms of STK38 include NDR NDR1 NDR1 protein kinase and nuclear Dbf2 related kinase 1. The NDR subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs protein tyrosine kinases RIO kinases aminoglycoside phosphotransferase choline kinase and phosphoinositide 3 kinase. NDR kinase contains an N terminal regulatory NTR domain and an insert within the catalytic domain that contains an auto inhibitory sequence. Like many other AGC kinases NDR kinase requires phosphorylation at two sites the activation loop A loop and the hydrophobic motif HM for activity. Higher eukaryotes contain two NDR isoforms NDR1 and NDR2. Both isoforms play a role in proper centrosome duplication. NDR1 is highly expressed in thymus muscle lung and spleen. It is not an essential protein because mice deficient of NDR1 remain viable and fertile. However these mice develop T cell lymphomas and appear to be hypersenstive to carcinogenic treatment. NDR1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor. The STK38 NDR1 gene is conserved in chimpanzee dog cow mouse rat chicken zebrafish and rice.

Antibodies that are reactive against the human STK38 can be used to inhibit the enzyme activity and or analyze the level of gene silencing by an RNAi agent directed to the STK38 gene. Such antibodies are commercially available e.g. from INVITROGEN SIGMA ALDRICH R D SYSTEMS and ABCAM .

As used herein the term expanding refers to increasing the number of like cells through cell division mitosis . The terms proliferating and expanding are used interchangeably. The terms proliferation and proliferative have the same meaning as expansion and expanded respectively. In one aspect the term expanding as applied to HSPCs is exclusive of cell division that results in daughter cells that have a more limited differentiation capacity than the starting cell. It is also possible that after cell division the two daughter cells are different from each other in terms of cell differentiation state or potentials. For example an HSPC described herein can undergo cell division and produce two daughter cells one of which assumed a myeloid lineage differentiation pathway and will proceed to divide to give rise to more myeloid lineage cells. The second daughter cell assumes the role of the starting cell and can proceed to divide to give rise to more daughter cells that are different from each other in terms of cell differentiation state or potentials.

As used herein the term hematopoietic stem progenitor cell hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell or HSPC refers to hematopoietic stem cells and or hematopoietic progenitor cells that can differentiate into the hematopoietic lineage and give rise to all blood cell types such as white blood cells and red blood cells all the blood cell types including myeloid monocytes and macrophages neutrophils basophils eosinophils erythrocytes megakaryocytes platelets dendritic cells and lymphoid lineages T cells B cells NK cells . Stem cells are defined by their ability to form multiple cell types multipotency and their ability to self renew. The definition of a hematopoietic stem cell as the term is used herein includes the ability to confer long term repopulation of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of an ablated subject. Hematopoietic progenitor cells are multipotent cells that are derived from hematopoietic stem cells but are more differentiated than the hematopoietic stem cell they came from and do not have the ability to self renew. Hematopoietic progenitor cells can be differentiated to the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage. A population of HSPCs can comprise the two types of cells 1 hematopoietic stem cells and 2 hematopoietic progenitor cells.

The term multipotency refers to a cell s ability to differentiate into some but not all of the cells derived from all three germ layers. Thus a multipotent cell is a partially differentiated cell. Multipotent cells are well known in the art and examples of multipotent cells include adult somatic stem cells such as for example hematopoietic stem progenitor cells and neural stem cells hair follicle stem cells liver stem cells etc. Multipotent means a stem cell may form many types of cells in a given lineage but not cells of other lineages. For example a multipotent blood stem cell can form the many different types of blood cells red white platelets etc. . . . but it cannot form neurons cardiovascular progenitor cell MICP differentiation into specific mature cardiac pacemaker smooth muscle and endothelial cell types pancreas derived multipotent progenitor PMP colonies produce cell types of pancreatic lineage cells that produces insulin glucagon amylase or somatostatin and neural lineage cells that are morphologically neuron like astrocytes like or oligodendrocyte like .

The term multipotency refers to a cell with the degree of developmental versatility that is less than totipotent and pluripotent.

The term totipotency refers to a cell with the degree of differentiation describing a capacity to make all of the cells in the adult body as well as the extra embryonic tissues including the placenta. The fertilized egg zygote is totipotent as are the early cleaved cells blastomeres 

The term pluripotency or a pluripotent state as used herein refers to a cell with the ability to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers endoderm gut tissue mesoderm including blood muscle and vessels and ectoderm such as skin and nerve and typically has the potential to divide in vitro for a long period of time e.g. greater than one year or more than 30 passages.

The term progenitor cell is used herein to refer to cells that have a cellular phenotype that is more primitive e.g. is at an earlier step along a developmental pathway or progression than is a fully differentiated cell relative to a cell which it can give rise to by differentiation. Often progenitor cells also have significant or very high proliferative potential but not self renewal capability. Progenitor cells can give rise to multiple distinct differentiated cell types or to a single differentiated cell type depending on the developmental pathway and on the environment in which the cells develop and differentiate e.g. myeloid lineage progenitor cells can give rise to monocytes macrophages neutrophils basophils eosinophils erythrocytes megakaryocytes platelets and dendritic cells. Lymphoid lineage progenitor cells give rise to T cells B cells and NK cells.

The term stem cell refers to a subset of progenitor cells that have the capacity or potential under particular circumstances to differentiate to a more specialized or differentiated phenotype and which retains the capacity under certain circumstances to proliferate without substantially differentiating. The term stem cell as used herein refers to an undifferentiated cell which is capable of proliferation and giving rise to more progenitor cells having the ability to generate a large number of mother cells that can in turn give rise to differentiated or differentiable daughter cells. The daughter cells themselves can be induced to proliferate and produce progeny that subsequently differentiate into one or more mature cell types while also retaining one or more cells with parental developmental potential. In one embodiment the term stem cell refers generally to a naturally occurring mother cell whose descendants progeny specialize often in different directions by differentiation e.g. by acquiring completely individual characters as occurs in progressive diversification of embryonic cells and tissues. Cellular differentiation is a complex process typically occurring through many cell divisions. A differentiated cell may derive from a multipotent cell which itself is derived from a multipotent cell and so on. While each of these multipotent cells may be considered stem cells the range of cell types each can give rise to may vary considerably. Some differentiated cells also have the capacity to give rise to cells of greater developmental potential. Such capacity may be natural or may be induced artificially upon treatment with various factors. In many biological instances stem cells are also multipotent because they can produce progeny of more than one distinct cell type but this is not required for stem ness. Self renewal is the other classical part of the stem cell definition and it is essential as used in this document. An indication of self renewal is asymmetric division with one daughter retaining the stem state and the other daughter expressing some distinct other specific function and phenotype. The stem cells disclosed herein continue to undergo mitosis and proliferate after seven weeks in culture.

In the context of cell ontogeny the term differentiate or differentiating is a relative term meaning a differentiated cell is a cell that has progressed further down the developmental pathway than its precursor cell. The term differentiated cell is meant any primary cell that is not in its native form pluripotent as that term is defined herein. The term a differentiated cell also encompasses cells that are partially differentiated such as multipotent cells e.g. hematopoietic stem progenitor cells .

In some embodiments the term differentiated cell also refers to a cell of a more specialized cell type derived from a cell of a less specialized cell type e.g. from an undifferentiated cell or a stem progenitor cell where the cell has undergone a cellular differentiation process.

The term contacting or contact as used herein in connection with contacting an isolated cell population comprising of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells with an agent and or RNAi agent as disclosed herein includes subjecting the cell to a culture medium which comprises the agent. Where the hematopoietic stem progenitor cell is in vivo contacting the HSPC with an agent and or RNAi agent includes administering the agent and or RNAi agent in a composition to a subject via an appropriate administration route such that the agent and or RNAi agent contacts the HSPC in vivo.

As used herein self renew in reference to a cell refers to the cell s ability to maintain its own population at an approximately constant level. The cell makes a duplicate copy of one self while also making a progenitor cell that will go on to produce other type of cells. Normally when a single hematopoietic stem progenitor cell undergoes one cell division two daughter cells are produced. One daughter becomes a progenitor cell that give rise to all the blood cell types while the other daughter cell becomes the hematopoietic stem progenitor cell.

The term isolated as used herein signifies that the cells are placed into conditions other than their natural environment. The term isolated does not preclude the later use of these cells thereafter in combinations or mixtures with other cells.

As used herein an isolated cell population comprising a hematopoietic stem progenitor cell or an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC as used herein refers to a population of HSPCs that is removed from their natural environment e.g. isolated by the methods disclosed herein. The population of HSPCs can be primary cells that have been removed from their original source e.g. a tissue such as the bone marrow in an animal and have not been cultured. The population of HSPCs can be homogenous i.e. having cells of the same type e.g. only hematopoietic stem cells or only hematopoietic progenitor cells or can be heterogeneous i.e. a mixed population of cells cells of several types e.g. hematopoeitic stem cells with myeloid lineage progenitor cells and lymphoid progenitor cells. Both myeloid lineage progenitor and lymphoid progenitor cells develop and produce cells with different roles in the hematopoeitic system. An isolated cell population comprising an HSPC is not necessary pure but rather is enriched for HSPCs e.g. relative to their environment in whole blood or bone marrow. By enriched is meant at least 2 fold higher concentration that a native sample i.e. whole blood sample or bone marrow sample.

While strictly speaking a nucleic acid sequence refers to the sequence of the nucleotide bases on the nucleic acid molecule the terms nucleic acid sequence or nucleic acid molecule are used interchangeably herein. Thus unless directed otherwise by context the term nucleic acid sequence or nucleic acid molecule refers to any molecule preferably a polymeric molecule incorporating units of ribonucleic acid deoxyribonucleic acid or an analog thereof. The nucleic acid can be either single stranded or double stranded. A single stranded nucleic acid can be one strand nucleic acid of a denatured double stranded DNA. Alternatively it can be a single stranded nucleic acid not derived from any double stranded DNA. In one aspect the nucleic acid sequence is a DNA. In another aspect the nucleic acid sequence is RNA. Suitable nucleic acid molecules are DNA including genomic DNA ribosomal DNA and cDNA. Other suitable nucleic acid molecules are RNA including mRNA rRNA and tRNA. The nucleic acid molecule can be naturally occurring as in genomic DNA or it may be synthetic i.e. prepared based upon human action or may be a combination of the two. The nucleic acid molecule can also have certain modifications such as 2 deoxy 2 deoxy 2 fluoro 2 O methyl 2 O methoxyethyl 2 O MOE 2 O aminopropyl 2 O AP 2 O dimethylaminoethyl 2 O DMAOE 2 O dimethylaminopropyl 2 O DMAP 2 O dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl 2 O DMAEOE or 2 O N methylacetamido 2 O NMA cholesterol addition phosphorothioate backbone as described in US Patent Application 20070213292 certain ribonucleosides that are linked between the 2 oxygen and the 4 carbon atoms with a methylene unit as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 268 490 wherein both the patent and patent application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The terms identical or percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids sequences refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides that are the same i.e. about 60 identity preferably 65 70 75 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or higher identity over a specified region e.g. nucleotide sequence comprising the SEQ ID NOS. 2 18 described herein when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using a BLAST or BLAST 2.0 sequence comparison algorithms with default parameters described below or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Such sequences are also said to be substantially identical. This term also refers to or can be applied to the complement of a test sequence. The term also can be used for sequences that have deletions and or additions as well as those that have substitutions. The BLAST or BLAST 2.0 sequence comparison alignment algorithms can account for gaps and the like. Preferably identity exists over a region that is at least about 15 nucleotides in length.

For sequence comparison typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are entered into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Preferably default program parameters can be used or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence based on the program parameters.

A comparison window as used herein includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 5 to 600 usually about 50 to about 200 more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence can be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson Lipman Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by manual alignment and visual inspection see e.g. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 supplement .

The term vector used herein refers to a nucleic acid sequence containing an origin of replication and which is designed for delivery to a host cell or transfer between different host cells. As used herein a vector can be viral or non viral. A vector can be a plasmid cosmid phagmid virus bacteriophage bacterial artificial chromosome or yeast artificial chromosome. A vector can be a DNA or RNA vector. A vector can be either a self replicating extrachromosomal vector or a vector which integrates into a host genome.

As used herein the term expression vector refers to a vector that has the ability to express heterologous nucleic acid fragments in a cell. An expression vector can comprise additional elements for example the expression vector can have two replication systems thus allowing it to be maintained in two organisms for example in human cells for expression and in a prokaryotic host for cloning and amplification.

As used herein the term viral vector refers to a nucleic acid vector construct that includes at least one element of viral origin and has the capacity to be packaged into a viral vector particle. The viral vector can contain the sequences disclosed herein or RNAi sequences in place of non essential viral genes. The vector and or particle can be utilized for the purpose of transferring nucleic acids into cells either in vitro or in vivo. Numerous forms of viral vectors are known in the art.

The term replication incompetent as used herein means the viral vector cannot further replicate and package its genomes. For example when the cells of a subject are infected with replication incompetent recombinant adeno associated virus rAAV virions the heterologous also known as transgene gene is expressed in the patient s cells but the rAAV is replication defective e.g. lacks accessory genes that encode proteins essential for packaging the virus and viral particles cannot be formed in the patient s cells.

The term gene means the nucleic acid sequence DNA which is transcribed to RNA in vitro or in vivo when operably linked to appropriate regulatory sequences. The gene may or may not include regions preceding and following the coding region e.g. 5 untranslated 5 UTR or leader sequences and 3 UTR or trailer sequences as well as intervening sequences introns between individual coding segments exons . The coding region of a gene can be a nucleotide sequence coding for an amino acid sequence or a functional RNA such as tRNA rRNA catalytic RNA siRNA miRNA and antisense RNA. A gene can also be an mRNA or cDNA corresponding to the coding regions e.g. exons and miRNA optionally comprising 5 or 3 untranslated sequences linked thereto. A gene can also be an amplified nucleic acid molecule produced in vitro comprising all or a part of the coding region and or 5 or 3 untranslated sequences linked thereto.

The term nucleic acid or oligonucleotide or polynucleotide used herein can mean at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. As will be appreciated by those in the art the depiction of a single strand also defines the sequence of the complementary strand. Thus a nucleic acid also encompasses the complementary strand of a depicted single strand. Of course where context or express language requires that a nucleic acid is single stranded the nucleic acid does not encompass the complementary strand. As will also be appreciated by those in the art many variants of a nucleic acid can be used for the same purpose as a given nucleic acid. Thus a nucleic acid can also encompass substantially identical nucleic acids and complements thereof.

Nucleic acids can be single stranded or double stranded or can contain portions of both double stranded and single stranded sequence. The nucleic acid can be DNA both genomic and cDNA RNA or a hybrid where the nucleic acid can contain combinations of deoxyribo and ribo nucleotides and combinations of bases including uracil adenine thymine cytosine guanine inosine xanthine hypoxanthine isocytosine and isoguanine. Nucleic acids can be obtained for example by chemical synthesis methods or by recombinant methods.

A nucleic acid will generally contain phosphodiester bonds although nucleic acid analogs can be included that can have at least one different linkage e.g. phosphoramidate phosphorothioate phosphorodithioate or O methylphosphoroamidite linkages and peptide nucleic acid backbones and linkages. Other analog nucleic acids include those with positive backbones non ionic backbones and non ribose backbones including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 235 033 and 5 034 506 which are incorporated by reference. Nucleic acids containing one or more non naturally occurring or modified nucleotides are also included within one definition of nucleic acids. The modified nucleotide analog can be located for example at the 5 end and or the 3 end of the nucleic acid molecule. Representative examples of nucleotide analogs can be selected from sugar or backbone modified ribonucleotides. It should be noted however that also nucleobase modified ribonucleotides i.e. ribonucleotides containing a non naturally occurring nucleobase instead of a naturally occurring nucleobase such as uridines or cytidines modified at the 5 position e.g. 5 2 amino propyl uridine 5 bromo uridine adenosines and guanosines modified at the 8 position e.g. 8 bromo guanosine deaza nucleotides e.g. 7 deaza adenosine O and N alkylated nucleotides e.g. N6 methyl adenosine are suitable. The 2 OH group can be replaced by a group selected from H. OR R. halo SH SR NH2 NHR NR2 or CN wherein R is C C6 alkyl alkenyl or alkynyl and halo is F Cl Br or I. Modifications of the ribose phosphate backbone can be done for a variety of reasons e.g. to increase the stability and half life of such molecules in physiological environments or as probes on a biochip. Mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made alternatively mixtures of different nucleic acid analogs and mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made.

The term subject as used herein includes without limitation a human mouse rat guinea pig dog cat horse cow pig monkey chimpanzee baboon or rhesus. In one embodiment the subject is a mammal. In another embodiment the subject is a human.

As used herein the term operably linked indicates to that the regulatory elements in genomic genes or in the nucleic acid constructs are positioned with respect to the genomic gene or other nucleic acid such that the gene or nucleic acid is transcribed to a primary transcript. The regulatory elements include e.g. promoters for the respective RNA polymerase docking and initiation of transcription.

The term agent refers to any entity which is normally not present or not present at the levels being contacted to a cell tissue or subject. Agent can be selected from a group comprising chemicals small molecules nucleic acid sequences nucleic acid analogues proteins peptides aptamers antibodies or functional fragments thereof. A nucleic acid sequence can be RNA or DNA and can be single or double stranded and can be selected from a group comprising nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest oligonucleotides and nucleic acid analogues for example peptide nucleic acid PNA pseudo complementary PNA pc PNA locked nucleic acid LNA etc. Such nucleic acid sequences include but are not limited to nucleic acid sequence encoding proteins for example that act as transcriptional repressors antisense molecules ribozymes small inhibitory nucleic acid sequences for example but not limited to RNAi shRNAi siRNA micro RNAi mRNAi antisense oligonucleotides etc. A protein and or peptide or fragment thereof can be any protein of interest for example but not limited to mutated proteins therapeutic proteins and truncated proteins wherein the protein is normally absent or expressed at lower levels in the cell. Proteins can also be selected from a group comprising mutated proteins genetically engineered proteins peptides synthetic peptides recombinant proteins chimeric proteins antibodies midibodies tribodies humanized proteins humanized antibodies chimeric antibodies modified proteins and fragments thereof. An agent can be applied to the medium where it contacts the cell and induces its effects. Alternatively an agent can be intracellular as a result of introduction of a nucleic acid sequence encoding the agent into the cell and its transcription resulting in the production of the nucleic acid and or protein environmental stimuli within the cell. In certain embodiments the agent is a small molecule having a chemical moiety. For example chemical moieties included unsubstituted or substituted alkyl aromatic or heterocyclyl moieties including macrolides leptomycins and related natural products or analogues thereof. Agents can be known to have a desired activity and or property or can be selected from a library of diverse compounds.

As used herein the term RNAi agent means any agent capable of mediating RNA interference RNAi . For example the agent may comprise a double stranded polynucleotide molecule comprising sense and antisense regions wherein the antisense region comprises complementarity to a target nucleic acid. Alternatively the molecule may also for example comprise a single stranded hairpin polynucleotide having sense and antisense regions wherein the antisense region comprises complementarity to such a target nucleic acid molecule. The molecule may also comprise a circular single stranded polynucleotide having one or more loop structures and a stem comprising self complementary sense and antisense regions wherein the antisense region comprises complementarity to a target nucleic acid molecule and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siRNA capable of mediating RNAi. An RNAi agent may also be a vector e.g. nucleic acid vector such as a DNA vector an expression vector such as a lentivirus coding for a molecule capable of mediating sequence specific RNAi for example coding for short interfering RNA siRNA double stranded RNA dsRNA micro RNA short hairpin RNA shRNA short interfering oligonucleotide short interfering nucleic acid and precursors and derivatives thereof.

In molecular biology complementarity is a property of double stranded nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA as well as DNA RNA duplexes. Each strand is complementary to the other in that the base pairs between them are non covalently connected via two or three hydrogen bonds.

The term inhibits as used herein refers to a decrease in the expression gene silencing or activity or function of a protein variants or homologues thereof and does not necessarily mean complete inhibition of expression and or activity. Rather expression or activity of the protein is inhibited to an extent and or for a time sufficient to produce the desired effect. Agents that inhibit a protein disclosed herein i.e. STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 are agents that inhibit the protein and or function by at least 10 . In some embodiments an inhibitor of the protein is an agent that inhibits the protein or expression of the protein by at least 10 .

As used herein gene silencing or gene silenced in reference to an activity of an RNAi molecule for example a siRNA or shRNA refers to a decrease in the mRNA level in a cell for a target gene i.e. STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 by at least about 5 about 10 about 20 about 30 about 40 about 50 about 60 about 70 about 80 about 90 about 95 about 99 up to and including about 100 of the mRNA level found in the cell without the presence of the RNAi agents e.g. shRNA or RNA interference molecules. In one preferred embodiment the mRNA levels are decreased by at least about 70 and preferably about 80 about 90 about 95 about 99 or even about 100 .

As used herein the term RNAi refers to any type of interfering RNA including but not limited to siRNAi shRNAi endogenous microRNA and artificial microRNA. For instance it includes sequences previously identified as siRNA regardless of the mechanism of down stream processing of the RNA i.e. although siRNAs are believed to have a specific method of in vivo processing resulting in the cleavage of mRNA such sequences can be incorporated into the vectors in the context of the flanking sequences described herein .

As used herein an siRNA refers to a nucleic acid that forms a double stranded RNA which double stranded RNA has the ability to reduce or inhibit expression of a gene or target gene when the siRNA is present or expressed in the same cell as the target gene for example STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12. The double stranded RNA siRNA can be formed by the complementary strands. In one embodiment a siRNA refers to a nucleic acid that can form a double stranded siRNA. The sequence of the siRNA can correspond to the full length target gene or a subsequence thereof. Typically the siRNA is at least about 15 50 nucleotides in length e.g. each complementary sequence of the double stranded siRNA is about 15 50 nucleotides in length and the double stranded siRNA is about 15 50 base pairs in length preferably about 19 30 base pairs preferably about 20 25 base pairs in length e.g. 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 nucleotides in length . It is preferred that an siRNA be less than 30 nucleotide as longer dsRNA tend to induce an apoptotic stress response in higher eukaryotic cells.

As used herein shRNA or small hairpin RNA also called stem loop is a type of siRNA. In one embodiment these shRNAs are composed of a short e.g. about 15 to about 25 nucleotide antisense strand followed by a nucleotide loop of about 5 to about 9 nucleotides and the analogous and complementary sense strand. Alternatively the sense strand can precede the nucleotide loop structure and the antisense strand can follow.

The terms microRNA or miRNA are used interchangeably herein refer to endogenous ds RNAs some of which are known to regulate the expression of protein coding genes at the posttranscriptional level. Endogenous microRNAs are small RNAs naturally present in the genome which are capable of modulating the productive utilization of mRNA. The term artificial microRNA includes any type of RNA sequence other than endogenous microRNA which is capable of modulating the productive utilization of mRNA. MicroRNA sequences have been described in publications such as Lim et al. Genes Development 17 p. 991 1008 2003 Lim et al Science 299 1540 2003 Lee and Ambros Science 294 862 2001 Lau et al. Science 294 858 861 2001 Lagos Quintana et al Current Biology 12 735 739 2002 Lagos Quintana et al Science 294 853 857 2001 and Lagos Quintana et al RNA 9 175 179 2003 which are incorporated by reference. Multiple microRNAs can also be incorporated into a precursor molecule. Furthermore miRNA like stem loops can be expressed in cells as a vehicle to deliver artificial miRNAs and short interfering RNAs siRNAs for the purpose of modulating the expression of endogenous genes through the miRNA and or RNAi pathways.

As used herein double stranded RNA or dsRNA refers to RNA molecules that are comprised of two strands. Double stranded molecules include those comprised of a single RNA molecule that doubles back on itself to form a two stranded structure. For example the stem loop structure of the progenitor molecules from which the single stranded miRNA is derived called the pre miRNA Bartel et al. 2004. Cell 116 281 297 comprises a dsRNA molecule.

The term effective amount as used herein refers to the amount of therapeutic agent of pharmaceutical composition sufficient to increase the number of HSPCs and or blood cells in the bone marrow and or in circulation by at least about 10 compared to before administration the composition.

The agent can be administered by any appropriate route which results in an desired effect in the subject e.g. increase the number of circulating red blood cells.

As used herein the term pharmaceutical composition refers to an active agent in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of chemicals and compounds commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excludes tissue culture medium.

In one embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. Specifically it refers to those compounds materials compositions and or dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio.

The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Ed. Gennaro ed. Mack Publishing Co. 1990 . The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

As used herein the term comprising or comprises is used in reference to methods and respective component s thereof that are essential to the subject matter or composition yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements whether essential or not. The use of comprising indicates inclusion rather than limitation.

As used herein the term consisting essentially of or consists essentially of refers to those elements required for a given embodiment. The term permits the presence of elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel or functional characteristic s of that embodiment.

The term consisting of refers to methods and respective components thereof as described herein which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the embodiment.

Protein expression from the genes for STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 can be reduced by inhibition of the expression of polypeptide e.g. transcription translation post translational processing or by gene silencing methods commonly known by persons of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary gene silencing methods include RNA interference and inhibition with antisense oligonucleotides antisense mechanism .

RNA interference RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved process whereby the expression or introduction of a nucleotide sequence that is identical or highly similar to a target gene or mRNA results in the sequence specific degradation or specific post transcriptional gene silencing PTGS of messenger RNA mRNA transcribed from that targeted gene see for example Coburn G. and Cullen B. 2002 J. Virology 76 9225 . In nature RNAi is initiated by the dsRNA specific endonuclease Dicer which promotes processive cleavage of long dsRNA into double stranded fragments termed siRNAs. siRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex termed RNA induced silencing complex or RISC that recognizes and cleaves target mRNAs. RNAi can also be initiated by introducing nucleic acid molecules e.g. synthetic siRNAs or RNA interfering agents to inhibit or silence the expression of target genes. As used herein inhibition of target gene expression includes any decrease in expression or protein activity or level of the mRNA or protein encoded by the target gene as compared to a situation wherein no RNA interference has been induced. The decrease will be of at least and preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 or more as compared to the expression of a target gene or the activity or level of the protein encoded by a target gene which has not been targeted by an RNA interfering agent.

As used herein the term RNAi agent refers to any agent capable of mediating RNA interference RNAi . In some embodiments RNAi agent is a single stranded or double stranded oligonucleotide. RNAi mediating molecules include but are not limited to siRNA dsRNA stRNA shRNA microRNA and modified versions thereof where the RNAi agent silences the gene expression of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 gene. An oligonucleotide based RNAi agent can be chemically synthesized can be produced by in vitro transcription or can be produced within a host cell.

In some embodiments the RNAi agent is an anti sense oligonucleic acid or a nucleic acid analogue for example DNA RNA peptide nucleic acid PNA pseudo complementary PNA pc PNA aptamers or locked nucleic acid LNA and the like.

In some embodiments single stranded RNA ssRNA a form of RNA endogenously found in eukaryotic cells can be used to form an RNAi molecule. Cellular ssRNA molecules include messenger RNAs and the progenitor pre messenger RNAs small nuclear RNAs small nucleolar RNAs transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs.

In some embodiments the double stranded RNAi agent comprises a sense strand and an antisense strand wherein the antisense strand has a region of complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of a target sequence and the duplex region is 14 30 nucleotides in length. Similarly the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 14 and 30 more generally between 18 and 25 yet more generally between 19 and 24 and most generally between 19 and 21 nucleotides in length. The phrase antisense strand as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide that is substantially or 100 complementary to a target sequence of interest. The phrase antisense strand includes the antisense region of both oligonucleotides that are formed from two separate strands as well as unimolecular oligonucleotides that are capable of forming hairpin or dumbbell type structures. The phrase sense strand refers to an oligonucleotide that has the same nucleotide sequence in whole or in part as a target sequence such as a messenger RNA or a sequence of DNA.

 Substantial complementarity refers to polynucleotide strands exhibiting 85 or greater complementarity excluding regions of the polynucleotide strands such as overhangs that are selected so as to be noncomplementary. Specific binding requires a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non specific binding of the oligomeric compound to non target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired i.e. under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment or in the case of in vitro assays under conditions in which the assays are performed. A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of contiguous residues in a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bonds e.g. Watson Crick base pairing with a second nucleic acid sequence e.g. 5 6 7 8 9 10 out of 10 being 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 complementary .

In some embodiments the double stranded region of a double stranded oligonucleotide is equal to or at least 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 nucleotide pairs in length. In some embodiments the antisense strand of a double stranded RNAi agent is equal to or at least 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the sense strand of a double stranded RNAi is equal to or at least 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 nucleotides in length.

The double stranded RNAi agent can comprise a single stranded 3 and or 5 overhang on each strand having a length of about 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 nucleotides. The length of the overhang is independent between the two strands i.e. the length of the overhang on one strand is not dependent on the length of the overhang on the second strand.

Double stranded RNAi agents also include small hairpin also called stem loop RNAs shRNAs . In one embodiment these shRNAs are composed of a short e.g. about 19 to about 25 nucleotide antisense strand followed by a nucleotide loop of about 5 to about 9 nucleotides and the analogous sense strand. Alternatively the sense strand can precede the nucleotide loop structure and the antisense strand can follow. These shRNAs can be contained in plasmids retroviruses and lentiviruses and expressed from for example the pol III U6 promoter or another promoter see e.g. Stewart et al. 2003 RNA April 9 4 493 501 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

By target sequence is meant any nucleic acid sequence whose expression or activity is to be modulated. The target nucleic acid can be DNA or RNA such as endogenous DNA or RNA viral DNA or viral RNA or other RNA encoded by a gene virus bacteria fungus mammal or plant. In some embodiments the target sequence is a cellular gene or genomic sequence e.g. that of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 mRNA sequence found at GENBANK Accession Nos. NM007271.2 NM000127 NM033123.2 NM002833 NM022073.3 NM000249.3 NM001167617.1 NM001167618.1 NM001167619.1 and NM033226.2.

The RNAi agent preferably targets only one sequence. Each of the RNA interfering agents such as siRNAs can be screened for potential off target effects by for example expression profiling. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art and are described for example in Jackson et al Nature Biotechnology 2003 6 635 637. In addition to expression profiling one can also screen the potential target sequences for similar sequences in the sequence databases to identify potential sequences which can have off target effects. For example as few as 11 contiguous nucleotides of sequence identity are sufficient to direct silencing of non targeted transcripts. Therefore one can initially screen the proposed siRNAs to avoid potential off target silencing using the sequence identity analysis by any known sequence comparison methods such as BLAST.

The RNAi agents need not be limited to those molecules containing only unmodified nucleotides but for example further encompass chemically modified nucleotides and or non nucleotides and also include molecules wherein a ribose sugar molecule is substituted for another sugar molecule or a molecule which performs a similar function. Moreover a non natural linkage between nucleotide residues can be used such as a phosphorothioate linkage. For example siRNA containing D arabinofuranosyl structures in place of the naturally occurring D ribonucleosides found in RNA can be used in RNAi agents useful for the methods described herein U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 196 . Other examples include RNA molecules containing o linkage between the sugar and the heterocyclic base of the nucleoside which confers nuclease resistance and tight complementary strand binding to the oligonucleotides. Other modifications to the polynucleotide include the incorporation or substitution of molecules similar to the oligonucleotides containing 2 O methyl ribose arabinose and particularly D arabinose U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 196 . These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Oligonucleotides can be derivatized with a reactive functional group of a reporter group such as a fluorophore. Particularly useful derivatives are modified at a terminus or termini of an oligonucleotide strand typically the 3 terminus of the sense strand of double stranded RNAi agents. For example the 2 hydroxyl at the 3 terminus can be readily and selectively derivatized with a variety of groups.

Other useful oligonucleotide modifications include incorporation of nucleotides having modified carbohydrate moieties such as 2 O alkylated residues or 2 O methyl ribosyl derivatives and 2 O fluoro ribosyl derivatives. The bases nucleobases can also be modified. Any modified base useful for inhibiting or interfering with the expression of a target sequence or that continues to permit RNA interference can be used. For example halogenated bases such as 5 bromouracil and 5 iodouracil can be incorporated. The bases can also be alkylated for example 7 methylguanosine can be incorporated in place of a guanosine residue. Non natural bases that yield successful inhibition can also be incorporated.

The more preferred oligonucleotide modifications include 2 deoxy 2 fluorouridine or locked nucleic acid LNA nucleotides and RNA duplexes containing either phosphodiester or varying numbers of phosphorothioate linkages. Such modifications are known to one skilled in the art and are described for example in Braasch et al. Biochemistry 42 7967 7975 2003. Most of the useful modifications to the siRNA molecules can be introduced using chemistries established for antisense oligonucleotide technology. Preferably the modifications involve minimal 2 O methyl modification preferably excluding such modification. Modifications also preferably exclude modifications of the free 5 hydroxyl groups of the siRNA.

Locked nucleic acids LNAs also known as bridged nucleic acids BNAs were developed by Wengel and co workers Koshkin A. A. 1998 Tetrahedron 54 3607 3630 and Imanishi and co workers Obika S. 1998 Tetrahedron Lett. 39 5401 5404 . LNA bases are ribonucleotide analogs containing a methylene linkage between the 2 oxygen and the 4 carbon of the ribose ring. The constraint on the sugar moiety results in a locked 3 endo conformation that preorganizes the base for hybridization and increases melting temperature Tm values as much as 10 C. per base Wengel J. 1999 Acc. Chem. Res. 32 301 310 Braasch D. A. and Corey D. R. 2001 Chem. Biol. 8 1 7 . LNA bases can be incorporated into oligonucleotides using standard protocols for DNA synthesis. This commonality facilitates the rapid synthesis of chimeric oligonucleotides that contain both DNA and LNA bases and allows chimeric oligomers to be tailored for their binding affinity and ability to activate RNase H. Because oligomers that contain LNA bases have a native phosphate backbone they are readily soluble in water. Introduction of LNA bases also confers resistance to nucleases when incorporated at the 5 and 3 ends of oligomers Crinelli R. et. al. 2002 Nucleic Acids Res. 30 2435 2443 . The ability to use LNAs for in vivo applications is also favored by the finding that LNAs have demonstrated low toxicity when delivered intravenously to animals Wahlestedt C. et. al. 2000 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 5633 5638 .

LNAs and LNA DNA chimeras have been shown to be potent inhibitors of human telomerase and a relatively short eight base LNA has been shown to be a 1000 fold more potent agent than an analogous peptide nucleic acid PNA oligomer Elayadi A. N. et. al. 2002 Biochemistry 41 9973 9981 . LNAs and LNA DNA chimeras have also been shown to be useful agents for antisense gene inhibition. Wengel and co workers have used LNAs to inhibit gene expression in mice Wahlestedt C. et. al. 2000 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 5633 5638 while Erdmann and colleagues have described the design of LNA containing oligomers that recruit RNase H and have described the rules governing RNase H activation by LNA DNA chimeras in cell free systems Kurreck J. et. al. 2002 Nucleic Acids Res. 30 1911 1918 .

The syntheses of LNA containing oligomers are known in the art for examples as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 316 198 6 670 461 6 794 499 6 977 295 6 998 484 7 053 195 and U.S Patent Publication No. US 2004 0014959 and all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Another nucleic acid derivative envisioned in the methods described herein is phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer PMO . PMOs are DNA mimics that inhibit expression of specific mRNAs in eukaryotic cells Arora V. et. al. 2000 J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 292 921 928 Qin G. et al. 2000 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 10 11 16 Summerton J. et. al. 1997 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7 63 70 . They are synthesized by using the four natural bases with a base sequence that is complementary antisense to a region of a specific mRNA. They are different than DNA in the chemical structure that links the bases together. Ribose has been replaced with a morpholine group and the phosphodiester is replaced with a phosphorodiamidate. These alterations make the antisense molecule resistant to nucleases Hudziak R. et. al. 1996 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 6 267 272 and free of charges at physiological pH yet it retains the molecular architecture required for binding specifically to a complementary strand of nucleic acid Stein D. et. al 1997 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7 151 157 Summerton J. et. al. 1997 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7 63 70 Summerton J. and D. Weller. 1997 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7 187 195 .

The synthesis structures and binding characteristics of morpholine oligomers are detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 698 685 5 127 866 5 142 047 5 166 315 5 521 063 and 5 506 337 and all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. PMOs can be synthesized at AVI BioPharma Corvallis Oreg. in accordance with known methods as described for example in Summerton J. and D. Weller U.S. Pat. No. 5 185 444 and Summerton J. and D. Weller. 1997 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7 187 195. For example PMO against STK38 or EXT1 transcripts containing between 12 40 nucleotide bases and having a targeting sequence of at least 12 subunits complementary to the respective transcript can be prepared. Methods of making and using PMO for the inhibition of gene expression in vivo are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2003 0171335 US 2003 0224055 US 2005 0261249 US 2006 0148747 S 2007 0274957 US 2007 003776 and US 2007 0129323 and these are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

 Short interfering RNA siRNA also referred to herein as small interfering RNA is defined as an agent which functions to inhibit expression of a target gene e.g. by RNAi. An siRNA can be chemically synthesized can be produced by in vitro transcription or can be produced within a host cell. In one embodiment siRNA is a double stranded RNA dsRNA molecule of about 15 to about 40 nucleotides in length preferably about 15 to about 28 nucleotides more preferably about 19 to about 25 nucleotides in length and more preferably about 19 20 21 22 or 23 nucleotides in length and can contain a 3 and or 5 overhang on each strand having a length of about 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 nucleotides. The length of the overhang is independent between the two strands i.e. the length of the overhang on one strand is not dependent on the length of the overhang on the second strand. Preferably the siRNA is capable of promoting RNA interference through degradation or specific post transcriptional gene silencing PTGS of the target messenger RNA mRNA .

siRNAs also include small hairpin also called stem loop RNAs shRNAs . In one embodiment these shRNAs are composed of a short e.g. about 19 to about 25 nucleotide antisense strand followed by a nucleotide loop of about 5 to about 9 nucleotides and the analogous sense strand. Alternatively the sense strand can precede the nucleotide loop structure and the antisense strand can follow. These shRNAs can be contained in plasmids retroviruses and lentiviruses and expressed from for example the pol III U6 promoter or another promoter see e.g. Stewart et al. 2003 RNA April 9 4 493 501 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

siRNA molecules need not be limited to those molecules containing only RNA but for example further encompasses chemically modified nucleotides and non nucleotides and also include molecules wherein a ribose sugar molecule is substituted for another sugar molecule or a molecule which performs a similar function. Moreover a non natural linkage between nucleotide residues can be used such as a phosphorothioate linkage. For example siRNA containing D arabinofuranosyl structures in place of the naturally occurring D ribonucleosides found in RNA can be used in RNAi agents according to the present invention U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 196 . Other examples include RNA molecules containing the o linkage between the sugar and the heterocyclic base of the nucleoside which confers nuclease resistance and tight complementary strand binding to the oligonucleotidesmolecules similar to the oligonucleotides containing 2 O methyl ribose arabinose and particularly D arabinose U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 196 . These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

siRNA and miRNA molecules having various tails covalently attached to either their 3 or to their 5 ends or to both are also known in the art and can be used to stabilize the siRNA and miRNA molecules delivered using the methods of the present invention. Generally speaking intercalating groups various kinds of reporter groups and lipophilic groups attached to the 3 or 5 ends of the RNA molecules are well known to one skilled in the art and are useful according to the methods of the present invention. Descriptions of syntheses of 3 cholesterol or 3 acridine modified oligonucleotides applicable to preparation of modified RNA molecules useful according to the present invention can be found for example in the articles Gamper H. B. Reed M. W. Cox T. Virosco J. S. Adams A. D. Gall A. Scholler J. K. and Meyer R. B. 1993 Facile Preparation and Exonuclease Stability of 3 Modified Oligodeoxynucleotides. Nucleic Acids Res. 21 145 150 and Reed M. W. Adams A. D. Nelson J. S. and Meyer R. B. Jr. 1991 Acridine and Cholesterol Derivatized Solid Supports for Improved Synthesis of 3 Modified Oligonucleotides. Bioconjugate Chem. 2 217 225 1993 .

Other siRNAs useful for targeting the genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 can be readily designed and tested. Accordingly siRNAs useful for the methods described herein include siRNA molecules of about 15 to about 40 or about 15 to about 28 nucleotides in length which are homologous to a gene sequence for STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12. Preferably the siRNA molecules targeting the gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 gene sequence have a length of about 15 to about 25 nucleotides. More preferably the siRNA molecules have a length of about 19 20 21 or 22 nucleotides. The siRNA molecules can also comprise a 3 hydroxyl group. The siRNA molecules can be blunt ended or comprise overhanging ends e.g. 5 3 . In specific embodiments the RNA molecule is double stranded and either blunt ended or comprises overhanging ends.

In one embodiment at least one strand of the RNA molecule has a 3 overhang from about 0 to about 6 nucleotides e.g. pyrimidine nucleotides purine nucleotides in length. In other embodiments the 3 overhang is from about 1 to about 5 nucleotides from about 1 to about 3 nucleotides and from about 2 to about 4 nucleotides in length. In one embodiment the RNA molecule that targets the gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 is double stranded wherein one strand has a 3 overhang and the other strand can be blunt ended or have an overhang. In the embodiment in which the gene targeting RNA molecule is double stranded and both strands comprise an overhang the length of the overhangs can be the same or different for each strand. In one embodiment the RNA comprises at least 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 or 22 nucleotides which are paired and which have overhangs of from about 1 to about 3 particularly about 2 nucleotides on both 3 ends of the RNA. In one embodiment the 3 overhangs can be stabilized against degradation. In a preferred embodiment the RNA is stabilized by including purine nucleotides such as adenosine or guanosine nucleotides. Alternatively substitution of pyrimidine nucleotides by modified analogues e.g. substitution of uridine 2 nucleotide 3 overhangs by 2 deoxythymidine is tolerated and does not affect the efficiency of RNAi. The absence of a 2 hydroxyl significantly enhances the nuclease resistance of the overhang in tissue culture medium.

In some embodiments assessment of the expression and or knock down of gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 using gene specific siRNAs can be determined by methods that are well known in the art such as western blot analysis or enzyme activity assays. Other methods can be readily performed by those of skill in the art based on the known sequence of the target mRNA.

siRNA sequences are chosen to maximize the uptake of the antisense guide strand of the siRNA into RISC and thereby maximize the ability of RISC to target the mRNA of the gene of interest. This can be accomplished by scanning for sequences that have the lowest free energy of binding at the 5 terminus of the antisense strand. The lower free energy leads to an enhancement of the unwinding of the 5 end of the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex thereby ensuring that the antisense strand will be taken up by RISC and direct the sequence specific cleavage of the mRNA of the human genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12. The free energy can be determined by any method known in the art e.g. as disclosed in Hong Zhou and Xiao Zeng 2008 Energy Profile and Secondary Structure Impact shRNA Efficacy IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine pages 31 36 and J. M Silva et al. 2003 Nature Genetics 35 303.

RNAi agents useful in the methods as disclosed herein can be produced using any known techniques such as direct chemical synthesis through processing of longer double stranded RNAs by exposure to recombinant Dicer protein or embryo lysates or through an in vitro system derived from S2 cells using phage RNA polymerase RNA dependant RNA polymerase and DNA based vectors. Use of cell lysates or in vitro processing can further involve the subsequent isolation of the short for example about 21 23 nucleotide siRNAs from the lysate etc. Chemical synthesis usually proceeds by making two single stranded RNA oligomers followed by the annealing of the two single stranded oligomers into a double stranded RNA. Other examples include methods disclosed in WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 that teach chemical and enzymatic synthesis of siRNA. Moreover numerous commercial services are available for designing and manufacturing specific siRNAs see e.g. QIAGEN Inc. Valencia Calif. and AMBION Inc. Austin Tex.

The synthesized RNAi agents can then be purified by any method known in the art. Methods for chemical synthesis of nucleic acids include but are not limited to in vitro chemical synthesis using phosphotriester phosphate or phosphoramidite chemistry and solid phase techniques or via deoxynucleoside H phosphonate intermediates see U.S. Pat.

The siRNA molecules described herein can be generated by annealing two complementary single stranded RNA molecules together one of which matches a portion of the target mRNA Fire et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 506 559 or through the use of a single hairpin RNA molecule that folds back on itself to produce the requisite double stranded portion Yu et al. 2002 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 6047 52 . The siRNA molecules can also be chemically synthesized Elbashir et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 98 .

Synthetic siRNA molecules including shRNA molecules can be obtained using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example the siRNA molecule can be chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced using methods known in the art such as using appropriately protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA RNA synthesizer see e.g. Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Elbashir S. M. W. Lendeckel and T. Tuschl 2001 Genes Development 15 188 200 Harborth J. et al. 2001 J. Cell Science 114 4557 4565 Masters J. R. et al. 2001 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 8012 8017 and Tuschl T. et al. 1999 Genes Development 13 3191 3197 .

As such siRNA molecules are not overly difficult to synthesize and are readily provided in a quality suitable for RNAi.

siRNA can also be produced by in vitro transcription using single stranded DNA templates Yu et al. supra . Alternatively the siRNA molecules can be produced biologically either transiently Yu et al. supra Sui et al. 2002 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 5515 20 or stably Paddison et al. 2002 Proc. Natl.

Reduction of levels of target mRNA in primary human cells in an efficient and sequence specific manner was demonstrated using adenoviral vectors that express hairpin RNAs which are further processed into siRNAs Arts et al. 2003 Genome Res. 13 2325 32 . In addition dsRNAs can be expressed as stem loop structures encoded by plasmid vectors retroviruses and lentiviruses Paddison P. J. et al. 2002 Genes Dev. 16 948 958 McManus M. T. et al. 2002 RNA 8 842 850 Paul C. P. et al. 2002 Nat. Biotechnol. 20 505 508 Miyagishi M. et al. 2002 Nat. Biotechnol. 20 497 500 Sui G. et al. 2002 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 5515 5520 Brummelkamp T. et al. 2002 Cancer Cell 2 243 Lee N. S. et al. 2002 Nat. Biotechnol. 20 500 505 Yu J. Y. et al. 2002 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 6047 6052 Zeng Y. et al. 2002 Mol.

These vectors generally have a polIII promoter upstream of the dsRNA and can express sense and antisense RNA strands separately and or as a hairpin structures. Within cells Dicer processes the short hairpin RNA shRNA into effective siRNA.

The targeted region of the siRNA molecule of the present invention can be selected from a target gene sequence e.g. the coding sequence of a gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 beginning from about 15 to 50 nucleotides from about 50 to 75 nucleotides or from about 75 to 100 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. Nucleotide sequences can contain 5 or 3 UTRs and regions near the start codon. One method of designing a siRNA molecule of the present invention involves identifying the 23 nucleotide sequence motif AA N19 TT where N can be any nucleotide and selecting hits with at least 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 or 75 G C content. The TT portion of the sequence is optional. Alternatively if no such sequence is found the search can be extended using the motif NA N21 where N can be any nucleotide. In this situation the 3 end of the sense siRNA can be converted to TT to allow for the generation of a symmetric duplex with respect to the sequence composition of the sense and antisense 3 overhangs. The antisense siRNA molecule can then be synthesized as the complement to nucleotide positions 1 to 21 of the 23 nucleotide sequence motif. The use of symmetric 3 TT overhangs can be advantageous to ensure that the small interfering ribonucleoprotein particles siRNPs are formed with approximately equal ratios of sense and antisense target RNA cleaving siRNPs Elbashir et al. 2001 supra and Elbashir et al. 2001 supra . Analysis of sequence databases including but are not limited to the NCBI Derwent and GenSeq as well as commercially available oligosynthesis software such as OLIGOENGINE can also be used to select siRNA sequences against EST libraries to ensure that only one gene is targeted.

Methods of predicting and selecting antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA are known in the art and are also found at the internet website of various companies e.g. Genscript Ambion Dharmacon Oigoengine the Wadsworth organization and the Whitehead Institute and also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 060 248.

In some aspects antisense nucleic acid technology can be used to inhibit the expression of gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12. It is possible to synthesize a strand of nucleic acid DNA RNA or a chemical analogue that will bind to the messenger RNA mRNA produced by that gene and inactivate it effectively turning that gene off . This synthesized nucleic acid is termed an anti sense oligonucleotide because its base sequence is complementary to the gene s messenger RNA mRNA which is called the sense sequence so that a sense segment of mRNA 5 AAGGUC 3 would be blocked by the anti sense mRNA segment 3 UUCCAG 5 .

Unmodified oligonucleotides may be less than optimal in some applications e.g. unmodified oligonucleotides can be prone to degradation by e.g. cellular nucleases. Nucleases can hydrolyze nucleic acid phosphodiester bonds. However chemical modifications to one or more of the subunits of oligonucleotide can confer improved properties and e.g. can render oligonucleotides more stable to nucleases.

In some circumstances for example where increased nuclease stability is desired nucleic acids having nucleic acid analogs and or modified internucleoside linkages can be preferred. Nucleic acids containing modified internucleoside linkages can be synthesized using reagents and methods that are well known in the art. For example methods of synthesizing nucleic acids containing phosphonate phosphorothioate phosphorodithioate phosphoramidate methoxyethyl phosphoramidate formacetal thioformacetal diisopropylsilyl acetamidate carbamate dimethylene sulfide CH S CH dimethylene sulfoxide CHSO CH dimethylene sulfone CH SO CH 2 O alkyl and 2 deoxy 2 fluoro phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages are well known in the art see Uhlmann et al. 1990 Chem. Rev. 90 543 584 Schneider et al. 1990 Tetrahedron Lett. 31 335 and references cited therein . U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 614 617 and 5 223 618 to Cook et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 714 606 to Acevedo et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 378 825 to Cook et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 672 697 and 5 466 786 to Buhr et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 777 092 to Cook et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 602 240 to De Mesmacker et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 610 289 to Cook et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 858 988 to Wang also describe nucleic acid analogs for enhanced nuclease stability and cellular uptake. These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The terms replacement modification alteration and the like as used in this context do not imply any process limitation e.g. modification does not mean that one must start with a reference or naturally occurring ribonucleic acid and modify it to produce a modified ribonucleic acid bur rather modified simply indicates a difference from a naturally occurring molecule.

As oligonucleotides are polymers of subunits or monomers many of the modifications described herein can occur at a position which is repeated within an oligonucleotide e.g. a modification of a nucleobase a sugar a phosphate moiety or the non bridging oxygen of a phosphate moiety. It is not necessary for all positions in a given oligonucleotide to be uniformly modified and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single oligonucleotide or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide.

In some cases the modification will occur at all of the subject positions in the oligonucleotide but in many and in fact in most cases it will not. By way of example a modification may only occur at a 3 or 5 terminal position may only occur in the internal region may only occur in a terminal regions e.g. at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2 3 4 5 or 10 nucleotides of an oligonucleotide. A modification can occur in a double strand region a single strand region or in both. A modification can occur only in the double strand region of an oligonucleotide or may only occur in a single strand region of an oligonucleotide. For example. a phosphorothioate modification at a non bridging oxygen position may only occur at one or both termini may only occur in a terminal regions e.g. at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2 3 4 5 or 10 nucleotides of a strand or may occur in double strand and single strand regions particularly at termini. The 5 end or ends can be phosphorylated.

A modification described herein may be the sole modification or the sole type of modification included on multiple nucleotides or a modification can be combined with one or more other modifications described herein. The modifications described herein can also be combined onto an oligonucleotide e.g. different nucleotides of an oligonucleotide have different modifications described herein.

In some embodiments it is particularly preferred e.g. to enhance stability to include particular nucleobases in overhangs or to include modified nucleotides or nucleotide surrogates in single strand overhangs e.g. in a 5 or 3 overhang or in both. E.g. it can be desirable to include purine nucleotides in overhangs. In some embodiments all or some of the bases in a 3 or 5 overhang will be modified e.g. with a modification described herein. Modifications can include e.g. the use of modifications at the 2 OH group of the ribose sugar e.g. the use of deoxyribonucleotides e.g. deoxythymidine instead of ribonucleotides and modifications in the phosphate group e.g. phosphothioate modifications. Overhangs need not be homologous with the target sequence.

In a preferred embodiment the siRNA or modified siRNA is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Additional carrier agents such as liposomes can be added to the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In another embodiment the siRNA is delivered by delivering a vector encoding small hairpin RNA shRNA in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to the cells in an organ of an individual. The shRNA is converted by the cells after transcription into a siRNA capable of targeting the gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12. In one embodiment the vector can be a plasmid a cosmid a phagmid a hybrid thereof or a virus. In one embodiment the vector can be a regulatable vector such as a tetracycline inducible vector.

In one embodiment the RNA interfering agents used in the methods described herein are taken up actively by cells in vivo following intravenous injection e.g. hydrodynamic injection without the use of a vector illustrating efficient in vivo delivery of the RNA interfering agents e.g. the siRNAs used in the methods described herein.

Other strategies for delivery of the RNA interfering agents e.g. the siRNAs or shRNAs used in the methods described herein can also be employed such as for example delivery by a vector e.g. a plasmid or viral vector e.g. a lentiviral vector. Such vectors can be used as described for example in Xiao Feng Qin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100 183 188. Other delivery methods include delivery of the RNA interfering agents e.g. the siRNAs or shRNAs described herein using a basic peptide by conjugating or mixing the RNA interfering agent with a basic peptide e.g. a fragment of a TAT peptide mixing with cationic lipids or formulating into particles.

As noted the dsRNA such as siRNA or shRNA can be delivered using an inducible vector such as a tetracycline inducible vector. Methods described for example in Wang et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100 5103 5106 using pTet On vectors BD Biosciences Clontech Palo Alto Calif. can be used. In some embodiments a vector can be a plasmid vector a viral vector or any other suitable vehicle adapted for the insertion and foreign sequence and for the introduction into eukaryotic cells. The vector can be an expression vector capable of directing the transcription of the DNA sequence of the agonist or antagonist nucleic acid molecules into RNA. Viral expression vectors can be selected from a group including for example retroviruses lentiviruses Epstein Barr virus bovine papilloma virus adenovirus and adeno associated based vectors or hybrid virus of any of the above. In one embodiment the vector is episomal. The use of a suitable episomal vector provides a means of maintaining the antagonist nucleic acid molecule in the subject in high copy number extra chromosomal DNA thereby eliminating potential effects of chromosomal integration.

Methods of delivering RNA interfering agents e.g. an siRNA or vectors containing an RNA interfering agent to the target cells e.g. the HSPCs can include for example i injection of a composition containing the RNA interfering agent e.g. an siRNA or ii directly contacting the cell e.g. a HSPC with a composition comprising an RNAi agent e.g. an siRNA or shRNA. In one embodiment the RNAi agent can be targeted to the bone marrow where the lymphocytes expressing STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 are made. In another embodiment RNAi agents e.g. an siRNA can be injected directly into any blood vessel such as vein artery venule or arteriole via e.g. hydrodynamic injection or catheterization see U.S. Pat. No. 7 148 205 . In yet another embodiment the RNAi agent can be injected or applied topically.

Administration can be by a single administration e.g. injection or by two or more administrations. The RNA interfering agent is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more RNA interfering agents can be used simultaneously. The RNA interfering agents e.g. the siRNAs targeting the mRNA of genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 can be delivered singly or in combination with other RNAi agents e.g. siRNAs such as for example siRNAs directed to other cellular genes. siRNAs targeting the gene of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 can also be administered in combination with other pharmaceutical agents such as those that mobilize HSPC from the bone marrow or stimulate in vivo expansion of HSPCs.

In one embodiment specific cells are targeted with RNA interference limiting potential side effects of RNA interference caused by non specific targeting of RNA interference. The method can use for example a complex or a fusion molecule comprising a cell targeting moiety and an RNA interference binding moiety that is used to deliver RNA interference effectively into cells. For example an antibody protamine fusion protein when mixed with an siRNA binds siRNA and selectively delivers the siRNA into cells expressing an antigen recognized by the antibody resulting in silencing of gene expression only in those cells that express the antigen e.g. CD34. The siRNA or RNA interference mediating molecule binding moiety is a protein or a nucleic acid binding domain or fragment of a protein and the binding moiety is fused to a portion of the targeting moiety. The location of the targeting moiety can be either in the carboxyl terminal or amino terminal end of the construct or in the middle of the fusion protein.

A viral mediated delivery mechanism can also be employed to deliver siRNAs to cells in vitro and in vivo as described in Xia H. et al. 2002 Nat Biotechnol 20 10 1006 . Plasmid or viral mediated delivery mechanisms of shRNA can also be employed to deliver shRNAs to cells in vitro and in vivo as described in Rubinson D. A. et al. 2003 Nat. Genet. 33 401 406 and Stewart S. A. et al. 2003 RNA 9 493 501 .

RNAi agents for e.g. an siRNA and shRNA can also be introduced into cells via the vascular or extravascular circulation the blood or lymph system and the cerebrospinal fluid.

In another embodiment the RNAi agent such as siRNA is delivered by using a fusion protein comprising a transduction domain PTD and a double stranded RNA binding domain DRBD . PTD is a short peptide that can be covalently linked to a macromolecule cargo and delivered into a cell. The PTD can be enzymatically cleaved after entering the cell liberation the siRNA. A fusion protein of PTD DRBD is used to coat siRNA and deliver the siRNA into the cell Steve Dowdy 2009 Nature Biotechnology .

In another embodiment the RNAi agent such as siRNA is delivered by using polymers that encapsulate the RNAi agent. For example a cationic polymer comprising a branched lysine and histidine polypeptide that acts like an siRNA condenser and protects the molecule from degradation. For example one study reports a system to deliver DNA in vitro by covalently attaching the surfactant associated protein B SP B to a 10 kDa poly lysine. See Baatz J. et al. PNAS USA 91 2547 2551 1994 . See e.g. Longmuir et al. 1992 ASBMB Biophysical Society abstract Longmuir et al. 1993 Biophysical Society abstract. In other embodiments polyethylene glycol PEG can be included in the encapsulation to improve the pharmacokinetics of the RNAi agent.

Liposomes spherical self enclosed vesicles composed of amphipathic lipids have been widely studied and are employed as vectors for in vivo administration of therapeutic agents. In particular the so called long circulating liposome formulations which avoid uptake by the organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system primarily the liver and spleen have found commercial applicability. Such long circulating liposomes include a surface coat of flexible water soluble polymer chains which act to prevent interaction between the liposome and the plasma components which play a role in liposome uptake. Alternatively hyaluronan has been used as a surface coating to maintain long circulation.

In one embodiment the liposome encapsulates the RNAi agent nucleic acid sequences vectors or even the viral particles. In one embodiment the nucleic acid sequences or vectors are condensed with a cationic polymer e.g. PEI polyamine spermidine and spermine or a cationic peptide e.g. protamine and poly lysine and encapsulated in the lipid particle. The liposomes can comprise multiple layers assembled in a step wise fashion.

Lipid materials are well known and routinely utilized in the art to produce liposomes. Lipids may include relatively rigid varieties such as sphingomyelin or fluid types such as phospholipids having unsaturated acyl chains. Phospholipid refers to any one phospholipid or combination of phospholipids capable of forming liposomes. Phosphatidylcholines PC including those obtained from egg soy beans or other plant sources or those that are partially or wholly synthetic or of variable lipid chain length and unsaturation are suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein. Synthetic semisynthetic and natural product phosphatidylcholines including but not limited to distearoylphosphatidylcholine DSPC hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine HSPC soy phosphatidylcholine soy PC egg phosphatidylcholine egg PC hydrogenated egg phosphatidylcholine HEPC dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine DPPC and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine DMPC are suitable phosphatidylcholines for use in the methods and compositions described herein. All of these phospholipids are commercially available. Further phosphatidylglycerols PG and phosphatic acid PA are also suitable phospholipids for use in the present invention and include but are not limited to dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol DMPG dilaurylphosphatidylglycerol DLPG dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol DPPG distearoylphosphatidylglycerol DSPG dimyristoylphosphatidic acid DMPA distearoylphosphatidic acid DSPA dilaurylphosphatidic acid DLPA and dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid DPPA . Distearoylphosphatidylglycerol DSPG is the preferred negatively charged lipid when used in formulations. Other suitable phospholipids include phosphatidylethanolamines phosphatidylinositols sphingomyelins and phosphatidic acids containing lauric myristic stearoyl and palmitic acid chains. For the purpose of stabilizing the lipid membrane it is preferred to add an additional lipid component such as cholesterol. Preferred lipids for producing liposomes according the methods and compositions described herein include phosphatidylethanolamine PE and phosphatidylcholine PC in further combination with cholesterol CH . According to one embodiment a combination of lipids and cholesterol for producing liposomes comprise a PE PC Chol molar ratio of 3 1 1. Further incorporation of polyethylene glycol PEG containing phospholipids is also contemplated.

In addition in order to prevent the uptake of the liposomes into the cellular endothelial systems and enhance the uptake of the liposomes into the tissue of interest the outer surface of the liposomes may be modified with a long circulating agent. The modification of the liposomes with a hydrophilic polymer as the long circulating agent is known to enable to prolong the half life of the liposomes in the blood

Liposomes encapsulating the nucleic acid sequences described herein can be obtained by any method known to the skilled artisan. For example the liposome preparation of the methods and compositions described herein can be produced by reverse phase evaporation REV method see U.S. Pat. No. 4 235 871 infusion procedures or detergent dilution. A review of these and other methods for producing liposomes may be found in the text Liposomes Marc Ostro ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1983 Chapter 1. See also Szoka Jr. et al. 1980 Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9 467 .

The dose of the particular RNA interfering agent will be in an amount necessary to effect RNA interference e.g. post translational gene silencing PTGS of the particular target gene thereby leading to inhibition of target gene expression or inhibition of activity or level of the protein encoded by the target gene.

It is also known that RNAi agents do not have to match perfectly to their target sequence. Preferably however the 5 and middle part of the antisense guide strand of the siRNA is perfectly complementary to the target nucleic acid sequence.

Accordingly the RNAi agents of the genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 disclosed herein include for example but are not limited to unmodified and modified double stranded ds RNA molecules including short temporal RNA stRNA small interfering RNA siRNA short hairpin RNA shRNA microRNA miRNA double stranded RNA dsRNA see e.g. Baulcombe Science 297 2002 2003 2002 . The dsRNA molecules e.g. siRNA also can contain 3 overhangs preferably 3 UU or 3 TT overhangs. In one embodiment the siRNA molecules do not include RNA molecules that comprise ssRNA greater than about 30 40 bases about 40 50 bases about 50 bases or more. In one embodiment the siRNA molecules are double stranded for more than about 25 more than about 50 more than about 60 more than about 70 more than about 80 or more than about 90 of their length. In some embodiments an RNAi agent binds to and inhibits the expression of mRNA of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 wherein the mRNA is found at GENBANK Accession Nos. NM007271.2 NM000127 NM033123.2 NM002833 NM022073.3 NM000249.3 NM001167617.1 NM001167618.1 NM001167619.1 and NM033226.2.

In another embodiment agents inhibiting the genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 are catalytic nucleic acid constructs such as for example ribozymes which are capable of cleaving RNA transcripts and thereby preventing the production of wildtype protein. Ribozymes are targeted to and anneal with a particular sequence by virtue of two regions of sequence complementary to the target flanking the ribozyme catalytic site. After binding the ribozyme cleaves the target in a site specific manner. The design and testing of ribozymes which specifically recognize and cleave sequences of the gene products described herein for example for the cleavage of the genes of STK38 EXT1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 or homologues or variants thereof can be achieved by techniques well known to those skilled in the art for example Lleber and Strauss 1995 Mol Cell Biol 15 540.551 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in it entirety .

Sources of CD34 positive hematopoietic stem progenitor cells HSPCs are the bone marrow of adults which includes femurs hip ribs sternum other bones umbilical cord blood placenta mobilized peripheral blood fetal liver fetal spleen and AGM Aorta gonad mesonephros of animals. Pre treatment with cytokines such as G CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factors can induce cells to be released from the bone marrow compartment.

For example growth factors GM CSF and G CSF can be administered to a potential donor of HSPC to mobilize the existing HSPC in the bone marrow niches to the peripheral circulating blood in vivo in order to increase the fraction of HSPCs circulating in the blood.

These HSPCs can be isolated by any methods known the art e.g. as disclosed herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 510 877 U.S Patent Publication No. 20090215083 and 20090169523 and WO WO 2009 129288 and WO 2005 030040. These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Cells can be obtained directly by removal from the hip using a needle and syringe or from the blood. For example collect peripheral blood in heparinized syringes or VACUTAINERS . Immediately mix the samples gently to prevent clotting. Cord blood and leukapheresis product from mobilized peripheral blood should already be heparinized. Dilute the sample with Hank s Buffered Saline Solution HBSS before proceeding to FICOLL PAQUE gradient centrifugation. For whole blood dilute with an equal volume of HBSS. For leukapheresis product dilute with three volumes of PBS. Add the diluted sample to 50 mL sterile centrifuge tubes. Underlay the diluted sample with 15 mL of sterile FICOLL PAQUE PLUS. Centrifuge at 400 g for 20 minutes with the brake off. Carefully harvest the mononuclear HSPCs from the interface between the FICOLL PAQUE PLUS and sample buffer using a sterile Pasteur pipette. Transfer the cells to sterile centrifuge tubes. Wash with an equal volume of HBSS and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 400 G to remove the FICOLL PAQUE PLUS residue. If multiple tubes are used pool the cells together and wash a second time in a large volume of HBSS. The CD34population of HSPCs can be further enriched using standard enrichment procedures that are known in the art.

The HSPCs can be isolated from fresh and frozen mononuclear cells of peripheral blood cord blood and bone marrow using its pan hematopoietic antigen CD34 or by other methods that are known to one skilled in the art. For example antibodies against CD34 can be used for immuno isolating the CD34hematopoietic progenitor cells from the mononuclear cell fraction. The anti CD34 antibodies can be conjugated with fluorophores or to magnetic beads for ease of separation by FACS or magnets respectively.

HSPCs bearing the pan hematopoietic antigen CD34 can also be isolated by taking advantage of the cells ability to bind galactose conjugated proteins. This lectin positive sub population represents approximately 0.1 to 0.5 of the total bone marrow cells and contains 100 of the hematopoietic progenitor cells. The galactose binding lectin on these cells is specific for this sugar. Additionally highly proliferative hematopoietic progenitor cells with very primitive phenotypes including a progenitor cell that produces multiple lineages express this lectin. Pipia and Long Nature Biotechnology 1997 15 007 1011 .

In some embodiments the CD34population of HSPCs can be enriched using surface markers such as CD38 CD45RA CD 90 and CD133. The further enrichment of HSPCs can be made by negative selection for CD38 and CD45RA and positive selection for CD90 and or CD133 in addition to CD34 see Cell Stem Cell 2007 1 6 635 45 e.g. using CD133 or CD38 affinity chromatography or FACS.

As used herein cryopreservation refers to the preservation of cells by cooling to low sub zero temperatures such as typically 77 K or 196 C. the boiling point of liquid nitrogen . Cryopreservation also refers to storing the cells at a temperature between 0 10 C. in the absence of any cryopreservative agents. At these low temperatures any biological activity including the biochemical reactions that would lead to cell death is effectively stopped. Cryoprotective agents are often used at sub zero temperatures to preserve the cells from damages due to freezing at low temperatures or warming to room temperature.

In one embodiment described herein is a cryopreserved pharmaceutical composition comprising a an isolated cell population comprising an HSPC that has been contacted with at least one RNAi agent which comprises at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by no more than 3 nucleotides from a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS 2 5 8 9 16 17 and 18 and or contacted with at least one agent which inhibits a protein selected from the group consisting of EXT1 PLCZ1 PTPN9 EGLN3 MLH1 and ABCC12 according to the method described herein b an amount of cryopreservative or cryoprotective agent sufficient for the cryopreservation of HSPCs and c a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Freezing is destructive to most living cells. Upon cooling as the external medium freezes cells equilibrate by losing water thus increasing intracellular solute concentration. Below about 10 15 C. intracellular freezing will occur. Both intracellular freezing and solution effects are responsible for cell injury Mazur P. 1970 Science 168 939 949 . It has been proposed that freezing destruction from extracellular ice is essentially a plasma membrane injury resulting from osmotic dehydration of the cell Meryman H. T. et al. 1977 Cryobiology 14 287 302 .

Cryoprotective agents and optimal cooling rates can protect against cell injury. Cryoprotection by solute addition is thought to occur by two potential mechanisms colligatively by penetration into the cell reducing the amount of ice formed or kinetically by decreasing the rate of water flow out of the cell in response to a decreased vapor pressure of external ice Meryman H. T. et al. 1977 Cryobiology 14 287 302 . Different optimal cooling rates have been described for different cells. Various groups have looked at the effect of cooling velocity or cryopreservative upon the survival or transplantation efficiency of frozen bone marrow cells or red blood cells Lovelock J. E. and Bishop M. W. H. 1959 Nature 183 1394 1395 Ashwood Smith M. J. 1961 Nature 190 1204 1205 Rowe A. W. and Rinfret A. P. 1962 Blood 20 636 Rowe A. W. and Fellig J. 1962 Fed. Proc. 21 157 Rowe A.

The successful recovery of human bone marrow cells after long term storage in liquid nitrogen has been described 1983 American Type Culture Collection Quarterly Newsletter 3 4 1 . In addition stem cells in bone marrow were shown capable of withstanding cryopreservation and thawing without significant cell death as demonstrated by the ability to form equal numbers of mixed myeloid erythroid colonies in vitro both before and after freezing Fabian I. et al. 1982 Exp.

The injurious effects associated with freezing can be circumvented by a use of a cryoprotective agent b control of the freezing rate and c storage at a temperature sufficiently low to minimize degradative reactions.

Cryoprotective agents which can be used include but are not limited to dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO Lovelock J. E. and Bishop M. W. H. 1959 Nature 183 1394 1395 Ashwood Smith M. J. 1961 Nature 190 1204 1205 glycerol polyvinylpyrrolidine Rinfret A. P. 1960 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 85 576 polyethylene glycol Sloviter H. A. and Ravdin R. G. 1962 Nature 196 548 albumin dextran sucrose ethylene glycol i erythritol D Sorbitol D mannitol Rowe A. W. et al. 1962 Fed. Proc. 21 157 D sorbitol i inositol D lactose choline chloride Bender M.

A. 1961 in Radiobiology Proceedings of the Third Australian Conference on Radiobiology Ilbery P. L. T. ed. Butterworth London p. 59 . In a preferred embodiment DMSO is used a liquid which is non toxic to cells in low concentration. Being a small molecule DMSO freely permeates the cell and protects intracellular organelles by combining with water to modify its freezability and prevent damage from ice formation. Addition of plasma e.g. to a concentration of 20 25 can augment the protective effect of DMSO. After addition of DMSO cells should be kept at 0 4 C. until freezing since DMSO concentrations of about 1 are toxic at temperatures above 4 C.

A controlled slow cooling rate is critical. Different cryoprotective agents Rapatz G. et al. 1968 Cryobiology 5 1 18 25 and different cell types have different optimal cooling rates see e.g. Rowe A. W. and Rinfret A. P. 1962 Blood 20 636 Rowe A. W. 1966 Cryobiology 3 1 12 18 Lewis J. P. et al. 1967 Transfusion 7 1 17 32 and Mazur P. 1970 Science 168 939 949 for effects of cooling velocity on survival of marrow stem cells and on their transplantation potential . The heat of fusion phase where water turns to ice should be minimal. The cooling procedure can be carried out by use of e.g. a programmable freezing device or a methanol bath procedure.

Programmable freezing apparatuses allow determination of optimal cooling rates and facilitate standard reproducible cooling. Programmable controlled rate freezers such as Cryomed or Planar permit tuning of the freezing regimen to the desired cooling rate curve. For example for marrow cells in 10 DMSO and 20 plasma the optimal rate is 1 to 3 C. minute from 0 C. to 80 C. In one embodiment this cooling rate can be used for the HSPCs described herein. The container holding the cells must be stable at cryogenic temperatures and allow for rapid heat transfer for effective control of both freezing and thawing. Sealed plastic vials e.g. Nunc Wheaton CRYULES or glass ampules can be used for multiple small amounts 1 2 ml while larger volumes 100 200 ml can be frozen in polyolefin bags e.g. Delmed held between metal plates for better heat transfer during cooling. Bags of bone marrow cells have been successfully frozen by placing them in 80 C. freezers which fortuitously gives a cooling rate of approximately 3 C. minute .

In an alternative embodiment the methanol bath method of cooling can be used. The methanol bath method is well suited to routine cryopreservation of multiple small items on a large scale. The method does not require manual control of the freezing rate nor a recorder to monitor the rate. In a preferred aspect DMSO treated cells are pre cooled on ice and transferred to a tray containing chilled methanol which is placed in turn in a mechanical refrigerator e.g. Harris or Revco at 80 C. Thermocouple measurements of the methanol bath and the samples indicate the desired cooling rate of 1 to 3 C. minute. After at least two hours the specimens have reached a temperature of 80 C. and can be placed directly into liquid nitrogen 196 C. for permanent storage.

After thorough freezing cells can be rapidly transferred to a long term cryogenic storage vessel. In a preferred embodiment HSPC samples can be cryogenically stored in liquid nitrogen 196 C. or its vapor 165 C. .

In a particular embodiment the cryopreservation procedure described in Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology 2007 Mick Bhatia et. al. ed. John Wiley and Sons Inc. is used in the methods described herein and is hereby incorporated by reference. Mainly when the HSPCs on a 10 cm tissue culture plate have reached approximately 50 confluency the media within the plate is aspirated and the HSPCs are rinsed with phosphate buffered saline. The adherent HSPCs are then detached by 3 ml of 0.025 trypsin 0.04 EDTA treatment. The trypsin EDTA is neutralized by 7 ml of media and the detached HSPC are collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 2 min. The supernatant is aspirated off and the pellet of HSPCs is resuspended in 1.5 ml of media. An aliquot of 1 ml of 100 DMSO is added to the suspension of HSPCs and gently mixed. Then 1 ml aliquot of this suspension of HSPCs in DMSO is dispensed into cryules in preparation for cryopreservation. The sterilized storage cryules preferably have their caps threaded inside allowing easy handling without contamination. Suitable racking systems are commercially available and can be used for cataloguing storage and retrieval of individual specimens.

Considerations and procedures for the manipulation cryopreservation and long term storage of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells particularly from bone marrow or peripheral blood can be found for example in the following references incorporated by reference herein Gorin N.C. 1986 Clinics In Haematology 15 1 19 48 Bone Marrow Conservation Culture and Transplantation Proceedings of a Panel Moscow Jul. 22 26 1968 International Atomic Energy Agency Vienna pp. 107 186.

Other methods of cryopreservation of viable cells or modifications thereof are available and contemplated for use e.g. cold metal minor techniques Livesey S. A. and Linner J. G. 1987 Nature 327 255 Linner J. G. et al. 1986 J. Histochem. Cytochem. 34 9 1123 1135 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 199 022 3 753 357 4 559 298 and are incorporated hereby reference.

Frozen HSPCs are preferably thawed quickly e.g. in a water bath maintained at 37 41 C. and chilled on ice immediately upon thawing. In particular the cryogenic vial containing the frozen HSPCs can be immersed up to its neck in a warm water bath gentle rotation will ensure mixing of the cell suspension as it thaws and increase heat transfer from the warm water to the internal ice mass. As soon as the ice has completely melted the vial can be immediately placed in ice.

In a particular embodiment the thawing procedure after cryopreservation is that described in Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology 2007 Mick Bhatia et. al. ed. John Wiley and Sons Inc. which is incorporated herein by reference. Immediately after removing the cryogenic vial from the cryo freezer the vial is rolled between the hands for 10 to 30 sec until the outside of the vial is frost free. The vial is then held upright in a 37 C. water bath until the contents are visibly thawed. The vial is immersed in 95 ethanol or sprayed with 70 ethanol to kill microorganisms from the water bath and air dry in a sterile hood. The contents of the vial are then transferred to a 10 cm sterile culture containing 9 ml of media using sterile techniques. The HSPCs can then be cultured and further expanded in a incubator at 37 C. with 5 humidified CO.

In some embodiments the HSPCs are treated in order to prevent cellular clumping upon thawing. To prevent clumping various procedures can be used including but not limited to the addition before and or after freezing of DNase Spitzer G. et al. 1980 Cancer 45 3075 3085 low molecular weight dextran and citrate hydroxyethyl starch Stiff P. J. et al. 1983 Cryobiology 20 17 24 .

The cryoprotective agent if toxic in humans should be removed prior to therapeutic use of the thawed HSPCs. In an embodiment employing DMSO as the cryopreservative it is preferable to omit this step in order to avoid cell loss since DMSO has no serious toxicity. However where removal of the cryoprotective agent is desired the removal is preferably accomplished upon thawing.

One way in which to remove the cryoprotective agent is by dilution to an insignificant concentration. This can be accomplished by addition of medium followed by if necessary one or more cycles of centrifugation to pellet the cells removal of the supernatant and resuspension of the cells. For example the intracellular DMSO in the thawed cells can be reduced to a level less than 1 that will not adversely affect the recovered cells. This is preferably done slowly to minimize potentially damaging osmotic gradients that occur during DMSO removal.

After removal of the cryoprotective agent cell count e.g. by use of a hemocytometer and viability testing e.g. by trypan blue exclusion Kuchler R. J. 1977 Biochemical Methods in Cell Culture and Virology Dowden Hutchinson Ross Stroudsburg Pa. pp. 18 19 1964 Methods in Medical Research Eisen H. N. et al. eds. Vol. 10 Year Book Medical Publishers Inc. Chicago pp. 39 47 can be done to confirm cell survival.

Other procedures which can be used relating to processing of the thawed cells include enrichment for adherent HSPCs and expansion by in vitro culture as described supra.

In a preferred but not required in some embodiments thawed cells are tested by standard assays for viability e.g. trypan blue exclusion and for microbial sterility by any methods known in the art and tested to confirm and or determine their identity relative to the recipient.

Methods for identity testing which can be used include but are not limited to HLA typing Bodmer W. 1973 in Manual of Tissue Typing Techniques Ray J. G. et al. eds. DHEW Publication No. NIH 74 545 pp. 24 27 and DNA fingerprinting which can be used to establish the genetic identity of the cells. DNA fingerprinting Jeffreys A. J. et al. 1985 Nature 314 67 73 exploits the extensive restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with hypervariable minisatellite regions of human DNA to enable identification of the origin of a DNA sample specific to each individual Jeffreys A. J. et al. 1985 Nature 316 76 Gill P. et al. 1985 Nature 318 577 Vassart G. et al. 1987 Science 235 683 and is thus preferred for use.

In a specific embodiment in which the HSPCs recovered for implantation are to be used in an autologous system the HSPCs should match exactly the recipient patient from whom the HSPCs are originally derived. In another embodiment the HSPCs are not used in an autologous system but are HLA typed match to the recipient. For example the HLA type matched for HLA A B C and D.

The colony forming cell CFC assay also referred to as the methylcellulose assay is an in vitro assay used in the study of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells HSPCs . The assay is based on the ability of HSPCs to proliferate and differentiate into colonies in a semi solid media in response to specific cytokine stimulation. The colonies formed can be enumerated and characterized according to their unique morphology.

CFC assays are well known to those skilled in the art and are also described herein. The following is a general description of the method. Aliquots of methylcellulose based media and cell resuspension solution Catalog HSC002 HSC003 HSC004 and HSC005 form STEMCELL Technologies are thawed at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes without disturbance. The mononuclear CD34HSPCs cells are resuspended in 10 mL or other appropriate volume of Iscoves Modified Dulbeccos Medium IMDM and counted. The total number of cells is calculated in order to determine the final cell number for each 35 mm culture plate. For example the approximate cell number needed for each 35 mm culture plate 5.0 10 2.0 10for enriched CD34cells in approximately 1.1 ml media. After the number of cells per 35 mm plate has been determined the appropriate volume of cells plus a slight excess is then transferred into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 300 G. The supernatant is removed and the pelleted cells are resuspended in cell resuspension solution or an appropriate media to the desired stock cell number. The stock cell number ideally is approximately 10 the final number needed for the assay.

Prior to plating the suspension of cells should be vigorously vortexed to thoroughly mix cells with the media and the tube is allowed to sit without agitation for approximately 20 minutes to allow air bubbles to escape. An aliquot of 1.1 mL of the final cell mixture is added to a 35 mm culture plate using a 3 mL syringe fitted with a 16 gauge needle. The cell mixture is spread evenly over the surface of the plate by gently rotating the plate.

Two 35 mm sample plates and a 35 mm uncovered plate containing 3 4 mL sterile water are placed in a 100 mm culture plate and the 100 mm plate is covered. The sterile water plate serves to maintain the humidity necessary for colony development. The cells are incubated for 14 16 days at 37 C. and 5 CO. Care should be exercised to avoid disturbing the plate during the incubation period to prevent shifting of the colonies. After approximately two weeks the colonies are ready for identification by morphology and counted otherwise known as scoring . Identification and counting of the individual colonies can be carried out using an inverted microscope and a scoring grid.

To be counted as a colony in this assay a colony will comprise at least 40 cells are counted or the minimum cell count set by each laboratory .

CFU E Colony forming unit erythroid clonogenic progenitors that produce only one or two clusters with each cluster containing from 8 to approximately 100 hemoglobinized erythroblasts. It represents the more mature erythroid progenitors that have less proliferative capacity.

CFU G Colony forming unit granulocyte Clonogenic progenitors of granulocytes that give rise to a homogeneous population of eosinophils basophils or neutrophils.

CFU GM Colony forming unit granulocyte macrophage Progenitors that give rise to colonies containing a heterogeneous population of macrophages and granulocytes. The morphology is similar to the CFU M and CFU G descriptions.

BFU E Burst forming unit erythroid The size of the colony can be described as small 3 to 8 clusters intermediate 9 to 16 clusters or large more than 16 clusters according to the number of clusters present. These are primitive erythroid progenitors that have high proliferative capacity.

CFU M Colony forming unit macrophage Clonogenic progenitors of macrophages that give rise to a homogenous population of macrophages.

CFU GEMM Colony forming unit granulocyte erythrocyte macrophage megakaryocyte Multi lineage progenitors that give rise to erythroid granulo cyte macrophage and megakaryocyte lineages as the name indicates.

In addition the progeny cells of the various colony types can be differentiated by the expression or non expression of surface marker proteins early progenitor HSPCs CD34 mature myeloid CD14 CD33 B lymphoid CD19 and megakaryocytic CD61 .

In normal adults the majority of primitive hematopoietic stem progentitor cells are concentrated in the bone marrow where they are in contact with a variety of molecules that influence their cell cycle status viability motility and differentiation. These include components of the extracellular matrix soluble and bound growth promoting factors and inhibitors and adhesion molecules that mediate direct interactions between cells. The long term culture LTC system initially developed to support the continued production of myeloid cells and subsequently for the production of lymphoid cells has provided a unique approach for the investigation of the regulation and maintenance of early HSPCs under conditions that reproduce many aspects of the marrow microenvironment. The LTC system has also provided a basis for the development of powerful assay procedures for quantitating and distinguishing cells at discrete stages of early hematopoietic cell differentiation.

LTC IC assay quantitates the number of stem progenitor cells that can continue to proliferate for several weeks in culture. The assay can be performed by any methods known in the art e.g. as disclosed by herein and by C. L. Miller and C J. Eaves in Long Term Culture Initiating Cell Assays for Human and Murine Cells 2001 Methods in Molecular Medicine 63 123 141 M. R. Koller 1998 Blood 91 4056 4064 Koller M R et al.

These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The following is a brief description of an LTC IC assay by limited dilution assay LDA . Generally LTC IC assay determined by LDA is carried out for cell cultures on irradiated preformed stroma. The stromal cells are grown to confluency in flat bottom 96 well plates e.g. 96 well plates at 10per well in 100 L LTC IC medium and irradiated at 30 Gy. Test cells are then added to these irradiated stromal layers at four concentrations in 100 L LTC IC medium per well 20 replicates each . The plates are then placed at 33 C. in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5 COin air and cell cultures are fed weekly by replacing 100 L LTC IC medium per well. At week 5 adherent and non adherent cells were harvested from each well. Cells from each well are added directly to 0.25 mL of colony assay medium in non tissue culture treated 24 well plates Falcon Lincoln Park N.J. . After 14 days wells were scored for colonies as before. For each sample the number of LTC IC was determined through an iterative calculation procedure based on the maximum likelihood solution method.

Modifying HSPC function to achieve specific differentiation events or to expand the number of engrafting repopulating cells is of considerable importance for the field of hematopoiesis. Unbiased candidate modifiers screened against a functional outcome of interest has been extremely powerful in other systems and here the feasibility of such an approach is tested in primary human stem progenitor cells.

Vector and virus production The shRNA library used in this study was a pooled version of the Broad Institute RNAi Consortium TRC lentiviral library with approximately 7000 shRNA vectors targeting around 1300 human genes. The pLKO self inactivating lentiviral vector drives shRNA expression from a human U6 promoter and carries the puromycin resistance gene under control of a PGK promoter. Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of the vector plamids in human 293T cells along with packaging plasmid pCMV 8.9 and envelope plasmid vsv g pHCMV G provided by The RNAi Consortium. All shRNA sequences that were individually assessed in the study are listed in Table 1.

Isolation culture and transduction of cells CD34cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood on Ficoll gradient and CD34cells were further separated from the mononuclear cells by double MACS columns Miltenyi Biotec as previously described. Cells were cultured in STEMSPAN Serum Free Expansion Medium SFEM STEMCELL Technologies with recombinant human thrombopoietin stem cell factor and Flt 3 ligand all from R D SYSTEMS at 100 ng ml each. Cells 200 000 cells per well were cultured for one day and then transduced overnight in 24 well plates coated with RETRONECTIN TAKARA BIO Inc. at a multiplicity of infection MOI of 2 rendering 20 30 tranduction efficiency of the CD34cells. Following transduction cells were re plated in fresh STEMSPAN medium and maintained with bi weekly half media changes and wells were split as needed.

CFC and LTC IC assays Colony forming cell CFC assays were established by plating cells in methylcellulose medium H4445 STEMCELL Technologies with or without 2.5 ug ml puromycin. Cells were plated according to Day 0 cell counts. Two weeks after plating cultures were evaluated for the presence of the following colony forming units CFU granulocyte macrophage CFU GM CFU erythroid CFU E and burst forming units erythroid BFU E . For Long term culture initiating cell LTC IC assays AFT024 stromal cells Dr. K. Moore were grown to confluence in 96 well plates and irradiated at 1500 rads 24 hours prior to establishing LTC IC cultures at limit dilution as previously described. LTC IC cultures were maintained for 5 weeks and medium was then replaced with clonogenic methylcellulose medium. After two weeks wells were evaluated for the presence of hematopoietic colonies.

Transplantation assays Cells were intravenously injected into 8 12 weeks old sublethally irradiated 350 rad NOD SCID mice. Contribution of human cells in bone marrow BM was measured by FACS after 7 weeks using human specific CD45 antibodies. For secondary transplantations a half femur equivalent of BM cells from primary transplanted mice was injected into new mice.

FACS analysis Cells were stained with anti human CD34 CD38 CD33 CD45 CD19 and CD15 all APC PE or FITC Becton Dickinson and analyzed using a FACSCALIBUR Becton Dickinson .

PCR cloning and sequencing To sequence proviral shRNA inserts methylcellulose colonies from each screening pool were harvested for DNA extraction. PCR amplification of proviral shRNAs was performed using the primers pair 5 GGATGAATACTGCCATTTGTCTCG 3 SEQ. ID. NO. 19 and 5 AGGCCGAAGGAATAGAAGA 3 SEQ. ID. NO. 20 . PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA kit Invitrogen and sequenced 10 12 clones per pool . Quantitative RT PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems Taqman kits.

RNAi screen in human CB CD34 cells Based on the limited ability of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells HSPCs to sustain primitive potential under ex vivo culture conditions a strategy was designed for pooled screens where perturbations conferring enhanced self renewal proliferation potential of HSPCs could be detected by positive selection . A pooled version of a lentiviral shRNA library from the Broad RNAi Consortium TRC targeting 1300 human genes mainly kinases phosphatases and proteases with on average 5 shRNA vectors per gene was used in this study. The library vector confers puromycin resistance. Twelve pools of umbilical cord blood derived CD34cells 200 000 cells per pool were each transduced with an aliquot of the complete pooled shRNA library and subsequently passaged in long term liquid cultures 10 weeks followed by colony forming cell CFC assays to positively select for clones that had acquired enhanced proliferation ability combined with a sustained primitive potential. It should be noted that under the conditions used persistence of cells with this phenotype of enhanced proliferation ability combined with a sustained primitive potential is extremely rare. This rarity provides an attractive baseline for the screening method used. The transduction efficiency was kept relatively low 20 30 to avoid doubly transduced cells. After 10 weeks in culture seven of the 12 library transduced pools exhibited a two to five fold increase in the number of CFCs compared to control transduced pools . All of these seven pools now contained close to 100 puromycin resistant cells showing that the long term culture had mediated a selection for library transduced cells . Of note one pool 7 exhibited high levels of burst forming unit colony forming unit erythroid BFU CFU E colonies in contrast to the predominantly myeloid type colonies seen in the other pools. The colonies from each screening pool were harvested in bulk for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification of the proviral inserts. The PCR products were cloned in bacteria and 10 12 clones per pool were sequenced to determine the distribution of shRNAs. shows the distribution of shRNAs between the different pools. The most prominent hits were shEXT1 Exostoses 1 which dominated pool 7 shPLCZ1 Phospholipase C zeta 1 which dominated pools 9 and 12 and was present in pools 8 and 11 and shSTK38 Serine threonine kinase 38 which dominated pool 4. For functional validation experiments with individual shRNAs these three hits were selected along with four additional shRNAs which either showed a frequency of more than 30 in a given pool or could be detected in more than one screening pool. The additional shRNA are shPTPN9 shEGLN3 shMLH1 and shABCC12. The shPTPN9 vector did not however produce sufficient virus titers for the validation assays.

Validation of candidate shRNAs summarizes the outcome of the validation assays. Cells transduced with either shPLCZ1 Phospholipase C zeta 1 or shSTK38 Serine threonine kinase 38 exhibited a more than a 1000 fold increased expansion of progenitors during culture . Despite an exponential growth rate for several weeks these progenitor cells had not become immortalized and the cells subsequently stopped growing after 12 15 weeks. Cells transduced with shEXT1 Exostoses 1 did not show the same overall expansion but produced dramatically higher frequencies of BFU CFU Es similar to the observation in the primary screen. Interestingly the marked effect of shEXT1 on BFU CFU E formation was only seen after 1 2 weeks whereas in the initial screen this was observed after 10 weeks of culture. Although it was occasionally noted that there is an increased BFU CFU E frequency at later time points the only consistent effect was at 1 2 weeks. It is possible that the effect at later time points required an optimal integration site of the vector or an initial target cell with certain rare qualities. Nevertheless the three most prominent hits from the screen shSTK38 shPLCZ1 and shEXT1 represented strong and reproducible perturbations specifically mediated by shRNAs.

Knockdown of EXT1 leads to increased BFU CFU E production The investigators next asked whether the higher levels of BFU CFU E colonies triggered by shEXT1 could be reproduced with additional non overlapping shRNAs targeting EXT1. The library contained five additional shRNAs against EXT1 that were tested functionally in the BFU CFU E assays as well as for knockdown of the EXT1 transcript. It should be noted that the aim when assessing knockdown is to test relative efficiency of the different shRNAs and that the level of transcript suppression must be interpreted with caution when testing heterogenous populations of primary cells. The level of knockdown in each cell will vary depending on differentiation stage vector copy number and integration site. The knockdown values from the transduced populations can mainly be used as a guide for relative potency of shRNAs rather than as an indicator of absolute levels.

One additional shRNA that conferred the erythroid phenotype and also knocked down the EXT1 transcript with similar efficiency as the original construct was found A and B . The other four constructs did not render a phenotype and showed significantly less efficient knockdown . To assess differences in relative knockdown efficiency a paired t test was used to test significance when comparing shEXT1 and shEXT1 3 with any of the other shRNAs. P values are indicated for the comparisons with shEXT1 4 and shEXT1 5. For comparisons with the other shRNAs the p values were below 0.02.

This strongly suggests that the effect on BFU CFU E production is specifically mediated by the loss of EXT1. EXT proteins are required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and studies in have shown that they thereby regulate the presentation of certain secreted growth factors such as Wnt and TGF beta at the cell surface.

shSTK38 expands candidate human hematopoietic stem cells To further characterize the dramatic expansion effects from shPLCZ1 and shSTK38 and assess whether self renewal of stem cells was affected the long term culture initiating cell LTC IC assays were performed. This assay can detect cells in a quantitative manner detect cells that are primitive and thus reflect repopulating HSPCs. Cells transduced with shSTK38 but not shPLCZ1 or shEXT1 displayed significantly higher numbers of LTC ICs as measured by limiting dilution assays LDAs after one week in culture indicative of an immediate effect on HSPC self renewal . The investigators focused on shSTK38 and first attempted to validate the target identity using six additional shRNA vectors against STK38. While several constructs knocked down the STK38 transcript to similar levels or even better than the original vector they did not trigger a similar expansion effect indicating that the phenotype is mediated at least partly through an off target effect on another gene. The investigators proceeded to study the effect from shSTK38 on modifying HSPC self renewal. To more stringently assess the potential for stem cell expansion shSTK38 transduced CD34cells were transplanted into NOD SCID mice either immediately after transduction or following 11 and 26 days of ex vivo culture. The transplanted cell doses were expansion equivalents of the indicated numbers of input Day 0 CD34cells prior to transduction. The level of human engraftment in bone marrow seven weeks post transplantation is shown in . The level of human engraftment seven weeks post transplantation for 50 000 input cells transplanted one day after transduction did not differ between control and test cells . However when transplanting the progeny of only 1000 input cells after 26 days of culture higher engraftment of shSTK38 transduced cells as compared to the 50 fold higher input dose transplanted at day 1 was observed . These data indicate a dramatic 50 fold expansion of NOD SCID repopulating activity over 26 days of culture. The cells expanded by shSTK38 were fully functional NOD SCID repopulating cells as defined by both B lymphoid CD19 and myeloid engraftment CD33and CD15 and also showed low but clearly detectable engraftment in secondary recipients . In half a femur equivalent of bone marrow from primary recipient mice was transplanted to a total of ten secondary recipients. Engraftment levels were analyzed in bone marrow after seven weeks. consistent with stem cell self renewal. Thus these data show by assays stringently assessing for stem cell rather than progenitor cell function that shSTK38 induces substantial ex vivo expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells.

Here the investigators have identified three types of outcomes associated with three specific shRNAs that are informative about such screens. First shRNAs targeting EXT1 induce an EXT1 specific effect and is an example of an unpredicted candidate gene target that alters at least ex vivo hematopoietic activity. Second shPLCZ1 modified a population of progenitor cells in vitro that did not score in subsequent more stem cell specific assays. Third shSTK38 revealed a consistent and potent effector of human hematopoietic stem cells resulting in dramatic expansion of the cells. Yet its specific molecular targets remain ill defined and do not appear to be the sequence against which the shRNA was engineered. This outcome is of greatest interest by virtue of its functional effect despite leaving the question of the actual gene target open.

Two general aspects about the screening strategy are important to consider. First while this first screen most likely had coverage of the entire library 7000 shRNAs in progenitor cells CFCs it did not saturate the library with respect to the targeting of the most primitive populations such as LTC ICs and SCID repopulating cells SRCs . Based on the current experience from assaying these populations from fresh CB CD34cells and given a 30 transduction efficiency of the shRNA library it is estimated that this screen had a 5 fold coverage of the library in CFCs 50 coverage in LTC ICs and 10 coverage in SRCs. Thus additional screens with higher cell numbers will be necessary for a deep assessment of the library in the most primitive populations. Second considering the use of integrating viral vectors and the selective pressure in the screening assays functional outcomes could be associated with insertional mutagenesis events for example from activation of proto onocogenes. The cells were therefore transduced at a relatively low multiplicity of infection MOI to avoid multiple integrations of the library vectors. It is still a possibility that the candidate shRNAs not showing a clear phenotype in the validation experiments initially scored due to insertional mutagenesis. However the most prominent outcomes from the primary screen were not associated with such mechanisms but specifically mediated by shRNA. It should also be noted that all phenotypes reported here for individual shRNAs were consistently reproduced in multiple experiments arguing against any involvement of lentiviral integration effects at that level.
