This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61 232 561 filed Aug. 10 2009 and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61 233 504 filed Aug. 13 2009 which are both incorporated by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with government support under Grants AI061139 RR020843 and AI055789 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The development and research of antigen binding moieties is a field which rapidly has processed within the last 30 years. Meanwhile particularly monoclonal antibodies are well established as biotherpeutic agents but also other scaffolds comprising target specificity already entered the market or proceed in development. Apart from that the use of antibodies and fragments thereof are self evident and indispensable for research purposes.

For the selection of antigen binding moieties a wide range of different techniques are in use. Apart of the isolation of antibody producing hybridoma from immunized mammals the use of synthetic libraries for phage or yeast display are only few of many examples.

However the selection process to isolate the target specific candidates from a highly diverse library is a crucial step within any antibody generation project and therefor many different strategies and procedures are well established. Generally the selection process comprises the incubation of the library with the antigen and the subsequent isolation of antibody antigen complexes. Thereby the antigen can be presented to the library in solution immobilized on a solid phase or presented on a cell. However in order to select antigen binding moieties which are directed to a specific epitope domain or site of an antigen these strategies are limited and desired candidates are isolated only by chance and thus have to be identified during extensive experimental characterization.

However in certain cases a binding moiety which detects only a specific variant of an antigen or a specific relevant epitope is necessary. Thereby the specificity of the antibody shall be directed to for example specific isoforms or splice variants of antigens or only to monomeric or heteromeric compositions of the target. Furthermore the detection of an active form but not the inactive form of an enzyme states another scenario which necessitates an epitope or site directed selection.

Antibodies targeting disease relevant enzymes are not only relevant for research purposes but also for use as a therapeutic agent or diagnostic tool for many indications. For example the antagonism of proteases can be used to inhibit uncontrollable bleeding during surgery exemplified by the development of the trypsin inhibitor Aprotinin but also Kallikrein Inhibitors that were described to be potentially useful not only to reduce blood loss during surgery but also to treat allery mediated hereditary angioedema. Furthermore sectreted proteases from pathogens provide additional potential targets for therapeutic but also diagnostic antibodies.

A specific example is the NS2B NS3 proteinase NS2B NS3pro expressed by the West Nile virus WNV which is a virus of the family Flaviviridae. It mainly infects birds but is known to infect humans horses dogs cats bats chipmunks skunks squirrels and domestic rabbits. The main route of human infection is through the bite of an infected mosquito. WNV may have different effects on humans asymptomatic infection a mild febrile syndrome termed West Nile Fever or a neuroinvasive disease termed West Nile meningitis or encephalitis.

2007 in the United States 2007 there were a total of 3 630 cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease WNND and 124 deaths were reported MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 57 26 720 3. July 2008 . 3.4 of the serious infections of WNV were fatal.

WNV control is largely achieved through mosquito control by elimination of mosquito breeding sites larviciding active breeding areas and encouraging personal use of mosquito repellents. Along with such efforts go environmental concerns and questions whether the detrimental health effects of spraying pesticides outweigh the relatively few lives which may be saved.

There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection. Intensive supportive therapy is directed toward the complications of brain infections. Anti inflammatory medications intravenous fluids and intensive medical monitoring may be required in severe cases. There is no specific antibiotic or antidote for the viral infection. There is also no vaccine to prevent the virus. Amongst the therapeutics under investigation is AMD 3100 Plerixafor Genzyme Inc. a small organic compound which has been proposed as an antiretroviral drug for HIV and morpholino antisense oligonucleotides conjugated to cell penetrating peptides AVI BioPharma Inc. There have also been attempts to treat infections using ribavirin intravenous immunoglobulin or alpha interferon and it has been found that blocking angiotensin II can treat the cytokine storm induced by WNV Curr Top Med Chem 4 13 1433 54 . We are however still far from an effective therapy for this emerging virus.

WNV is an enveloped positive stranded 11 kb RNA virus. The genomic RNA of WNV encodes a polyprotein precursor which consists of three structural proteins C capsid prM membrane and E envelope and seven nonstructural proteins NS1 NS2A NS2B NS3 NS4A NS4B and NS5 arranged in the order C prM E NS1 NS2A NS2BNS3 NS4A NS4B NS5.

Polyprotein processing by the viral two component NS2B NS3 proteinase NS2B NS3pro and also by the host cell secretase and furin is required to generate individual viral proteins. The full length NS3 is a multifunctional protein in which the N terminal 184 amino acid residues represent the NS3pro domain and the C terminal sequence codes for the enzyme with the helicase nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA triphosphatase activities all of which are coordinately regulated through localization within membrane compartments in the infected cell. NS2B functions as an essential cofactor of NS3pro. The cofactor activity of the 48 amino acid central portion of NS2B is roughly equivalent to that of the entire NS2B sequence Biochem J. 401 743 752 . Structural studies have determined that NS2B wraps around NS3pro completing in a precise and well defined fashion the structure of the active site. In agreement deletion of the NS2B sequence inactivates the functional activity of NS3pro J. Virol. 78 13708 13716 .

NS3pro is responsible for the cleavage of the capsid protein C and at the NS2A NS2B NS2B NS3 NS3 NS4A NS4A NS4B and NS4B NS5 boundaries. Because inactivating mutations of the NS3pro cleavage sites in the polyprotein precursor abolished viral infectivity J. Virol. 67 6797 6807 Curr Med. Chem. 15 2771 2784 it is a reasonable expectation that the NS3pro function is vitally important for the virus and that NS3pro antagonists have may have merit as viral drugs.

Several peptide and small organic inhibitors of NS3pro have recently been identified PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 3 e356 Assay Drug Dev Technol. 5 737 750 J Med. Chem. 49 6585 6590 Antiviral Res. 80 94 101 J Gen Virol. 88 2223 2227 Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 52 3385 3393 J Med. Chem. 51 5714 5721 Antiviral Res. 82 110 114 . There are however obstacles which all of these molecules e.g. inefficient cell penetration poor solubility and lack of stability.

Antibodies could provide a much sought excellent scaffold for designing inhibitors targeted to this enzyme. Over the past decade recombinant technology has enabled the production of engineered antibody fragments such as Fabs or single chain FV scFv fragments and phage display technology has been used successfully for the isolation of specific scFv or Fab from human repertoire libraries Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 13 598 602 . For phage display selection the Fab format is preferred since scFv fragments have a high tendency to form multimers. Fab are more stable compared to scFv fragments and tend to stay completely monomeric allowing selection for affinity in contrast to selection for avidity.

In the present application we describe a novel screening strategy which enables the selection of antigen binding moieties that target only a specific epitope site or domain of an antigen. To exemplify the effectiveness of the claimed selection strategy we describe the first successful generation of antibodies against WNV NS2B NS3pro which are highly selective and target the active site of WNV NS2B NS3pro. Various uses and analysis upon application of the antibodies of the present invention are disclosed herein below. The generation of antibodies or antibody fragments which are directed only to the active variant of an enzyme enables the development of more efficient therapeutic agents. The specificity only for the variant which is therapeutically relevant facilitates the development of highly efficient antibodies with reduced side effects due to lacking cross reactivity to the inactive form accompanied by the advantage that lower doses have to be administered. Additionally the disclosed screening method dismisses all antibodies targeting an irrelevant epitope and therby accelerates lead candidate identification and development. Furthermore the antibodies that bind specifically to the active site of a protein isolated by the disclosed screening method can be used for the identification of idiotypic antibodies which mimic the activity of the enzyme protein. In turn such antibodies bearing enzymatic activity can be used for therapeutic purposes.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.

In certain aspects the present invention provides a novel screening and identification method for antigen binding moieties with novel and advantageous properties. Said method can be used to isolate antigen binding moieties for example antibodies which bind to a selected site of an antigen. Thereby the selected site of an antigen is only present or displayed within a specific variant of the antigen. Thereby this specific variant can be a specific epitope of an antigen an active form of a protein or an isoform of a target family or a monomeric or heteromeric variant of an antigen but is not limited to that.

The term epitope means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.

With reference to the present invention an epitope preferably represents a specific site of an antigen which has functional relevance by either mediting activation or inhibition of a specific downstream processing and thereby defines a potential target site for a therapeutic or diagnostic agent. In this line epitope mutants represent variants of the antigen in which the relevant epitope is either removed or substituted by other amino acid. According to the selection method disclosed herein epitope mutant can be used for counterscreening to identify antigen binding moieties which are specific for the selected epitope of the antigen.

The terms cross block cross blocked and cross blocking are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody or other binding agent to interfere with the binding of other antibodies or binding agents to a certain epitope in a standard competitive binding assay. The ability or extent to which an antibody or other binding agent is able to interfere with the binding of another antibody or binding molecule to an epitope and therefore whether it can be said to cross block according to the invention can be determined using standard competition binding assays. One suitable assay involves the use of the Biacore technology e.g. by using the BIAcore 3000 instrument Biacore Uppsala Sweden which can measure the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another assay for measuring cross blocking uses an ELISA based approach. Such antibodies are also referred to as antibodies which compete for binding to an epitope.

Therefore in certain embodiments the present invention provides antigen binding moieties which cross block antigen binding moieties antibodies or antibody fragments specifically disclosed in the present invention.

Preferable said antigen contains at least one enzymatic activity such as protease activity. In particular aspects of the present invention the novel screening method provides for the isolation of antigen binding moieties which inhibit the enzymatic activity of the antigen. Enzymatic activities that may be targeted by the antigen binding moieties isolated in accordance with the method of the present invention include oxidoreductase activity oxidoreductases catalyze the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another transferase activity transferases catalyze the transfer of a functional group e.g. a methyl or phosphate group from one molecule to another hydrolase activity hydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of a chemical bond lyase activity lyases catalyze the breaking of chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation isomerase activity isomerases catalyze the structural rearrangement of isomers and ligase activity ligases catalyse the joining of two molecules by forming a new chemical bond .

In certain aspects of the present invention the antigen binding moieties isolated by the screening method are isolated form a library of antigen binding moieties. Such library may be any kind of library such as an antibody library a Fab library a scFv library or a phage display library. Such library may comprise more than 10 more than 10 more than more than 10 more than 10 more than 10 more than 10 more than 10 more than 10or more than 10members.

In essence an active antigen is used in an initial screening step to isolate members form a library of antigen binding moieties that bind to said active antigen. The antigen is active in a sense that it comprises an activity or a functional property that differentiates it from a corresponding inactive variant of the same antigen. Such inactive variant is used in a second counter screening step in which those antigen binding moieties are isolated which do not bind to said variant antigen. An active antigen may be an antigen that possesses an enzymatic activity and an inactive antigen a respective antigen which is devoid of the respective activity e.g. due a mutation in the active site. An active antigen may also be an antigen which elicits an immune response and a corresponding inactive antigen an antigen which does not elicit an immune response. Other pairs of active and inactive antigens may however be used as well and will be self evident to the skilled artisan.

The term isoform refers to a different version of a protein that may be produced by different genes or from the same gene by alternative splicing as defined by the Unified Medical Language System at the National Library of Medicine. In certain embodiments isoforms may have the same function and in alternate embodiments protein isoforms may have different functions.

With reference to the present invention an isoform preferably represents a specific variant of an antigen which is implicated to play a role in the induction and or progression of specific diseases and thereby represents a reasonable target molecule for a therapeutic agent or a potential marker to be targeted by diagnostic agents.

As used herein the term multimeric generally refers to the aggregation state of an antigen wherein at least two species of the same antigen interact. Thus the terms heteromer as used herein refer to the state of at least two different species polypeptides associated with each other. And the term monomer refers to a single peptide chain of an antigen.

With reference to the present invention a multimeric state of an antigen represents a reasonable diagnostic marker or therapeutic target if solely the occurrence of a specific aggregation state or its level of occurrence is in conjunction to the induction and or progression of specific diseases.

In certain aspects the present invention provides for the use of a first polypeptide comprising an enzymatic activity and a second polypeptide for the isolation of antigen binding moieties that inhibit the enzymatic activity of the first polypeptide wherein said second polypeptide is a variant of said first polypeptide which is devoid of enzymatic activity.

The term antigen binding moiety as used herein refers to one or more fragments that confer to a molecule the ability to specifically bind to a given antigen e.g. NS2B NS3 proteinase of West Nile Virus . Antibodies for example are molecules comprising antigen binding moieties. Antibody derivatives antibody like scaffolds and alternative scaffolds may do so as well. Examples of molecules comprising antigen binding moieties are given herein below and include fibronectin Compound Therapeutics Inc. Waltham Mass. camelid antibodies ankyrin Molecular Partners AG Zurich Switzerland domain antibodies Domantis Ltd. Cambridge Mass. and Ablynx nv Zwijnaarde Belgium lipocalin Pieris Proteolab AG Freising Germany small modular immuno pharmaceuticals Trubion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Seattle Wash. maxybodies Avidia Inc. Mountain View Calif. Protein A Affibody AG Sweden and affilin gamma crystallin or ubiquitin Scil Proteins GmbH Halle Germany .

The term antibody as used herein includes whole antibodies and any fragment or single chains thereof. A naturally occurring antibody is a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy H chains and two light L chains inter connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region abbreviated herein as VH and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region abbreviated herein as VL and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability termed complementary determining regions CDR interspersed with regions that are more conserved termed framework regions FR . Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino terminus to carboxy terminus in the following order FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors including various cells of the immune system e.g. effector cells and the first component C1q of the classical complement system. Antigen binding functions of an antibody can be performed by fragments of an intact antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term antibody fragment of an antibody include a Fab fragment a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL VH CL and CH1 domains a F ab 2 fragment a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody a single domain antibody dAb fragment Ward et al. 1989 Nature 341 544 546 which consists of a VH domain and an isolated complementary determining region CDR .

The terms heavy chain variable region CDR1 and H CDR1 are used interchangeably as are the terms heavy chain variable region CDR2 and H CDR2 the terms heavy chain variable region CDR3 and H CDR3 the terms light chain variable region CDR1 and L CDR1 the terms light chain variable region CDR2 and L CDR2 and the terms light chain variable region CDR3 and L CDR3 .

Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment VL and VH are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by an artificial peptide linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 Science 242 423 426 and Huston et al. 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85 5879 5883 . Such single chain antibodies include one or more antigen binding moieties. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.

Antigen binding moieties can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies maxibodies minibodies intrabodies diabodies triabodies tetrabodies v NAR and bis scFv see e.g. Hollinger and Hudson 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 . Antigen binding moieties of antibodies can be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as Fibronectin type III Fn3 see U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 199 which describes fibronectin polypeptide monobodies .

Antigen binding moieties can be incorporated into single chain molecules comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments VH CH1 VH CH1 which together with complementary light chain polypeptides form a pair of antigen binding regions Zapata et al. 1995 Protein Eng. 8 10 1057 1062 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 .

Other antibody immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds comprising antigen binding moieties can be employed in line with the present invention. This includes non immunoglobulin based antibodies and scaffolds onto which CDRs of the invention can be grafted.

The fibronectin scaffolds are based on fibronectin type III domain e.g. the tenth module of the fibronectin type III 10 Fn3 domain . The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or 8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta sheets which themselves pack against each other to form the core of the protein and further containing loops analogous to CDRs which connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich where the edge is the boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands see U.S. Pat. No. 6 818 418 . These fibronectin based scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin although the overall fold is closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment the variable region of the heavy chain which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. Because of this structure the non immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin based molecules can be used as scaffolds where the loop regions of the molecule can be replaced with CDRs of the invention using standard cloning techniques.

Camelid antibody proteins obtained from members of the camel and dromedary Camelus bactrianus and Calelus dromaderius family including new world members such as llama species Lama paccos Lama glama and Lama vicugna have been characterized with respect to size structural complexity and antigenicity for human subjects. Certain IgG antibodies from this family of mammals as found in nature lack light chains and are thus structurally distinct from the typical four chain quaternary structure having two heavy and two light chains for antibodies from other animals. See WO 94 04678.

The ankyrin technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti parallel helices and a turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.

Avimers are derived from natural A domain containing protein such as LRP 1. These domains are used by nature for protein protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins are structurally based on A domains. Avimers consist of a number of different A domain monomers 2 10 linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the target antigen using the methodology described in for example U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040175756 20050053973 20050048512 and 20060008844.

Affibody affinity ligands are small simple proteins composed of a three helix bundle based on the scaffold of one of the IgG binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein from the bacterium . This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids 13 of which are randomized to generate affibody libraries with a large number of ligand variants See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 831 012 . Affibody molecules mimic antibodies they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa compared to the molecular weight of antibodies which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size the binding site of affibody molecules is similar to that of an antibody.

Anticalins are products developed by the company Pieris ProteoLab AG. They are derived from lipocalins a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in the physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds. Several natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids. The protein architecture is reminiscent of immunoglobulins with hypervariable loops on top of a rigid framework. However in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments lipocalins are composed of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues being just marginally bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain. The set of four loops which makes up the binding pocket shows pronounced structural plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains. The binding site can thus be reshaped in a proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed target molecules of different shape with high affinity and specificity. One protein of lipocalin family the bilin binding protein BBP of has been used to develop anticalins by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent application describing anticalins is in PCT Publication No. WO 199916873.

Affilin molecules are small non immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for specific affinities towards proteins and small molecules. New affilin molecules can be very quickly selected from two libraries each of which is based on a different human derived scaffold protein. Affilin molecules do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins. Currently two affilin scaffolds are employed one of which is gamma crystalline a human structural eye lens protein and the other is ubiquitin superfamily proteins. Both human scaffolds are very small show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH changes and denaturing agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta sheet structure of the proteins. Examples of gamma crystalline derived proteins are described in WO200104144 and examples of ubiquitin like proteins are described in WO2004106368.

Protein epitope mimetics PEM are medium sized cyclic peptide like molecules MW 1 2 kDa mimicking beta hairpin secondary structures of proteins the major secondary structure involved in protein protein interactions.

The term human antibody as used herein is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. Furthermore if the antibody contains a constant region the constant region also is derived from such human sequences e.g. human germline sequences or mutated versions of human germline sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences e.g. mutations introduced by random or site specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo . Compared to the chimeric or humanized antibodies antibodies of the invention have further reduced antigenicity when administered to human subjects.

As used herein a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions or full length heavy or light chains that are the product of or derived from a particular germline sequence if the variable regions or full length chains of the antibody are obtained from a system that uses human germline immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of interest. A human antibody that is the product of or derived from a human germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline immunoglobulins and selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in sequence i.e. greatest identity to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody that is the product of or derived from a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence due to for example naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site directed mutations. However in the VH or VL framework regions a selected human antibody typically is at least 90 identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species e.g. murine germline sequences . In certain cases a human antibody may be at least 60 70 80 90 or at least 95 or even at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically a recombinant human antibody will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene in the VH or VL framework regions. In certain cases the human antibody may display no more than 5 or even no more than 4 3 2 or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene.

The terms monoclonal antibody as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.

The term human monoclonal antibody refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human sequences. In one embodiment the human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal e.g. a transgenic mouse having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.

A humanized antibody is an antibody that retains the reactivity of a non human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved for instance by retaining the non human CDR regions and replacing the remaining parts of the antibody with their human counterparts i.e. the constant region as well as the framework portions of the variable region . See e.g. Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 1984 Morrison and Oi Adv. Immunol. 44 65 92 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 Padlan Molec. Immun. 28 489 498 1991 and Padlan Molec. Immun. 31 169 217 1994. Other examples of human engineering technology include but is not limited to Xoma technology disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 886.

The term chimeric antibody is an antibody molecule in which a the constant region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site variable region is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class effector function and or species or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody e.g. an enzyme toxin hormone growth factor drug etc. or b the variable region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity. For example a mouse antibody can be modified by replacing its constant region with the constant region from a human immunoglobulin. Due to the replacement with a human constant region the chimeric antibody can retain its specificity in recognizing the antigen while having reduced antigenicity in human as compared to the original mouse antibody.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the antigen binding moieties antibodies or fragments thereof are human humanized chimeric or murine. In specific embodiments the antigen binding moieties antibodies or fragments thereof are human or humanized. In other specific embodiments the antigen binding moieties antibodies or fragments thereof are human.

The term isolated antibody refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities. Moreover an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and or chemicals.

The term isotype refers to the antibody class e.g. IgM IgE IgG such as IgG1 or IgG4 that is provided by the heavy chain constant region genes. Isotype also includes modified versions of one of these classes where modifications have been made to alter the Fc function for example to enhance or reduce effector functions or binding to Fc receptors.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the antigen binding moieties of are of the type IgG IgM IgA IGE or IgD. In specific embodiments the antigen binding moieties of are of the type IgG.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the antigen binding moieties of are of the subtype IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4. In specific embodiments the antigen binding moieties are of the subtype IgG1 or IgG4. In other specific embodiments the antigen binding moieties are of the subtype IgG1.

The term amino acid refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code as well as those amino acids that are later modified e.g. hydroxyproline carboxyglutamate and O phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid i.e. an alpha carbon that is bound to a hydrogen a carboxyl group an amino group and an R group e.g. homoserine norleucine methionine sulfoxide methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups e.g. norleucine or modified peptide backbones but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.

The terms polypeptide and protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non naturally occurring amino acid polymer. Unless otherwise indicated a particular polypeptide sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof.

The term nucleic acid is used herein interchangeably with the term polynucleotide and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single or double stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages which are synthetic naturally occurring and non naturally occurring which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include without limitation phosphorothioates phosphoramidates methyl phosphonates chiral methyl phosphonates 2 O methyl ribonucleotides peptide nucleic acids PNAs . Unless otherwise indicated a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof e.g. degenerate codon substitutions and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically as detailed below degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected or all codons is substituted with mixed base and or deoxyinosine residues Batzer et al. Nucleic Acid Res. 19 5081 1991 Ohtsuka et al. J. Biol. Chem. 260 2605 2608 1985 and Rossolini et al. Mol. Cell. Probes 8 91 98 1994 .

The term operably linked refers to a functional relationship between two or more polynucleotide e.g. DNA segments. Typically it refers to the functional relationship of a transcriptional regulatory sequence to a transcribed sequence. For example a promoter or enhancer sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates or modulates the transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system. Generally promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence i.e. they are cis acting. However some transcriptional regulatory sequences such as enhancers need not be physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose transcription they enhance.

As used herein the term optimized means that a nucleotide sequence has been altered to encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the production cell or organism generally a eukaryotic cell for example a cell of a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell CHO or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is engineered to retain completely or as much as possible the amino acid sequence originally encoded by the starting nucleotide sequence which is also known as the parental sequence. The optimized sequences herein have been engineered to have codons that are preferred in mammalian cells. However optimized expression of these sequences in other eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells is also envisioned herein. The amino acid sequences encoded by optimized nucleotide sequences are also referred to as optimized.

The term recombinant host cell or simply host cell refers to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences such progeny may not in fact be identical to the parent cell but are still included within the scope of the term host cell as used herein.

The term vector is intended to refer to a polynucleotide molecule capable of transporting another polynucleotide to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors such as viral vectors e.g. replication defective retroviruses adenoviruses and adeno associated viruses which serve equivalent functions.

In certain embodiments the present invention provides nucleic acids encoding the antigen binding moieties the antibodies or the antibody fragments disclosed in the present invention. In certain embodiments there nucleic acids are isolated nucleic acids. In certain embodiments there nucleic acids are substantially purified nucleic acids.

In certain embodiments the present invention provides nucleic acids encoding the heavy chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NOs 1 9 17 25 33 41 and 49 and or the nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NOs 5 13 21 29 37 45 and 53. In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid molecules are those encoding anyone of the variable regions or CDR regions shown in Table 2. Some other nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical e.g. at least 65 80 95 or 99 to the nucleotide sequences of those encoding the heavy chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NOs 1 9 17 25 33 41 and 49 and or the nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NOs 5 13 21 29 37 45 and 53. When expressed from appropriate expression vectors polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are capable of exhibiting NS2B NS3 proteinase binding capacity.

Also provided in the present invention are polynucleotides which encode at least one CDR region and usually all three CDR regions from the heavy or light chain of the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties set forth above. Some other polynucleotides encode all or substantially all of the variable region sequence of the heavy chain and or the light chain of the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties set forth above. Because of the degeneracy of the code a variety of nucleic acid sequences will encode each of the immunoglobulin amino acid sequences.

The polynucleotide sequences can be produced by de novo solid phase DNA synthesis or by PCR mutagenesis of an existing sequence e.g. sequences as described in the Examples below encoding an NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moiety. Direct chemical synthesis of nucleic acids can be accomplished by methods known in the art such as the phosphotriester method of Narang et al. 1979 Meth. Enzymol. 68 90 the phosphodiester method of Brown et al. Meth. Enzymol. 68 109 1979 the diethylphosphoramidite method of Beaucage et al. Tetra. Lett. 22 1859 1981 and the solid support method of U.S. Pat. No. 4 458 066. Introducing mutations to a polynucleotide sequence by PCR can be performed as described in e.g. PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification H. A. Erlich Ed. Freeman Press NY N.Y. 1992 PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Innis et al. Ed. Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 Mattila et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 19 967 1991 and Eckert et al. PCR Methods and Applications 1 17 1991.

The present invention also provides vectors such as expression vectors comprising the nucleic acids of the present invention. Various expression vectors can be employed to express the polynucleotides encoding the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties. Both viral based and non viral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a mammalian host cell. Non viral vectors and systems include plasmids episomal vectors typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA and human artificial chromosomes see e.g. Harrington et al. Nat Genet. 15 345 1997 . For example non viral vectors useful for expression of the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding polynucleotides and polypeptides in mammalian e.g. human cells include pThioHis A B C pcDNA3.1 His pEBVHis A B C Invitrogen San Diego Calif. MPSV vectors and numerous other vectors known in the art for expressing other proteins. Useful viral vectors include vectors based on retroviruses adenoviruses adenoassociated viruses herpes viruses vectors based on SV40 papilloma virus HBP Epstein Barr virus vaccinia virus vectors and Semliki Forest virus SFV . See Brent et al. supra Smith Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 49 807 1995 and Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 1992.

The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be expressed. Typically the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences e.g. enhancers that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding a NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antibody chain or fragment. In some embodiments an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include e.g. arabinose lacZ metallothionein promoter or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under non inducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters other regulatory elements may also be required or desired for efficient expression of an NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antibody chain or fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use see e.g. Scharf et al. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20 125 1994 and Bittner et al. Meth. Enzymol. 153 516 1987 . For example the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.

The expression vectors may also provide a secretion signal sequence position to form a fusion protein with polypeptides encoded by inserted NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antibody sequences. More often the inserted NS2B NS3 proteinase binding sequences are linked to a signal sequences before inclusion in the vector. Vectors to be used to receive sequences encoding NS2B NS3 proteinase binding light and heavy chain variable domains sometimes also encode constant regions or parts thereof. Such vectors allow expression of the variable regions as fusion proteins with the constant regions thereby leading to production of intact antibodies or fragments thereof. Typically such constant regions are human.

Also provided in the present invention are host cells comprising a nucleic acid molecule or a vector as set forth in the present invention. In certain embodiments said host cell is a recombinant host cell.

The host cells for harboring and expressing the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moiety can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. is one prokaryotic host useful for cloning and expressing the polynucleotides of the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli such as and ther enterobacteriaceae such as and various species. In these prokaryotic hosts one can also make expression vectors which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell e.g. an origin of replication . In addition any number of a variety of well known promoters will be present such as the lactose promoter system a tryptophan trp promoter system a beta lactamase promoter system or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters typically control expression optionally with an operator sequence and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other microbes such as yeast can also be employed to express NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties of the invention. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.

In some preferred embodiments mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties of the present invention. For example they can be either a hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes or a mammalian cell line harboring an exogenous expression vector. These include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. For example a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed including the CHO cell lines various Cos cell lines HeLa cells myeloma cell lines transformed B cells and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in e.g. Winnacker FROM GENES TO CLONES VCH Publishers N.Y. N.Y. 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences such as an origin of replication a promoter and an enhancer see e.g. Queen et al. Immunol. Rev. 89 49 68 1986 and necessary processing information sites such as ribosome binding sites RNA splice sites polyadenylation sites and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters may be constitutive cell type specific stage specific and or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include but are not limited to the metallothionein promoter the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter the dexamethasone inducible MMTV promoter the SV40 promoter the MRP polIII promoter the constitutive MPSV promoter the tetracycline inducible CMV promoter such as the human immediate early CMV promoter the constitutive CMV promoter and promoter enhancer combinations known in the art.

Methods for introducing expression vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of interest vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts. See generally Sambrook et al. supra . Other methods include e.g. electroporation calcium phosphate treatment liposome mediated transformation injection and microinjection ballistic methods virosomes immunoliposomes polycation nucleic acid conjugates naked DNA artificial virions fusion to the herpes virus structural protein VP22 Elliot and O Hare Cell 88 223 1997 agent enhanced uptake of DNA and ex vivo transduction. For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression will often be desired. For example cell lines which stably express NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties can be prepared using expression vectors of the invention which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection and its presence allows growth of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences in selective media. Resistant stably transfected cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type.

In other embodiments the VH and or VL amino acid sequences may be identical except an amino acid substitution in no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acid position. An antigen binding moiety or antibody having VH and VL regions having high i.e. 80 or greater identity to the VH and VL regions of those shown in Table 2 can be obtained by mutagenesis e.g. site directed or PCR mediated mutagenesis of nucleic acid molecules encoding the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions shown in Table 2 followed by testing of the encoded altered antibody for retained function using the functional assays described herein.

The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm as described in the non limiting examples below.

Additionally or alternatively the protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a query sequence to perform a search against public databases to for example identify related sequences. For example such searches can be performed using the BLAST program version 2.0 of Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 10.

In certain embodiments an antibody or antigen binding moiety of the invention has a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences and a light chain variable region comprising CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences wherein one or more of these CDR sequences have specified amino acid sequences based on the antigen binding moiety and antibodies described herein or conservative modifications thereof and wherein the antibodies retain the desired functional properties of the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties of the invention. Accordingly the invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody or a functional antigen binding fragment thereof consisting of a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences and a light chain variable region comprising CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences wherein the heavy chain variable region CDR1 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2 10 18 26 34 42 and 50 and conservative modifications thereof the heavy chain variable region CDR2 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 3 11 19 27 35 43 and 51 and conservative modifications thereof the heavy chain variable region CDR3 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 4 12 20 28 36 44 and 52 and conservative modifications thereof the light chain variable regions CDR1 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 6 14 22 30 38 46 and 54 and conservative modifications thereof the light chain variable regions CDR2 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 7 15 23 31 39 47 and 55 and conservative modifications thereof the light chain variable regions of CDR3 amino acid sequences are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 16 24 32 40 48 and 56 and conservative modifications thereof the antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof specifically bind to NS2B NS3 proteinase of West Nile Virus.

In certain aspects the invention provides an isolated antigen binding moiety having a full length heavy chain comprising an amino acid sequence that has been optimized for expression in the cell of a mammalian selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 1 9 17 25 33 41 and 49 and a full length light chain comprising an amino acid sequence that has been optimized for expression in the cell of a mammalian selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 5 13 21 29 37 45 and 53. In certain specific aspects the isolated antigen binding moiety is an isolated monoclonal antibody.

In another aspect the present invention provides NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties that comprise the heavy chain and light chain CDR1s CDR2s and CDR3s as described in Table 2 or combinations thereof. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR1s of are shown in SEQ ID NOs 2 10 18 26 34 42 and 50. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR2s of the antibodies and are shown in SEQ ID NOs 3 11 19 27 35 43 and 51. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 4 12 20 28 36 44 and 52.

The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR2s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 7 15 23 31 39 47 and 55. The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 8 16 24 32 40 48 and 56. The CDR regions are delineated using the Kabat system Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Fifth Edition U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 .

Given that each of these antigen binding moieties can bind to NS2B NS3 proteinase of West Nile Virus and that antigen binding specificity is provided primarily by the CDR1 2 and 3 regions the VH CDR1 2 and 3 sequences and VL CDR1 2 and 3 sequences can be mixed and matched i.e. CDRs from different antigen binding moieties can be mixed and match. For antibodies each antibody must contain a VH CDR1 2 and 3 and a VL CDR1 2 and 3 to create other NS2B NS3 proteinase binding binding molecules of the invention. Such mixed and matched NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antibodies can be tested using the binding assays known in the art and those described in the Examples e.g. ELISAs . When VH CDR sequences are mixed and matched the CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 sequence from a particular VH sequence should be replaced with a structurally similar CDR sequence s . Likewise when VL CDR sequences are mixed and matched the CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 sequence from a particular VL sequence should be replaced with a structurally similar CDR sequence s . It will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan that novel VH and VL sequences can be created by substituting one or more VH and or VL CDR region sequences with structurally similar sequences from the CDR sequences shown herein for monoclonal antibodies of the present invention.

Accordingly the present invention provides an isolated antigen binding moieties comprising a heavy chain variable region CDR1 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2 10 18 26 34 42 and 50 a heavy chain variable region CDR2 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 3 11 19 27 35 43 and 51 a heavy chain variable region CDR3 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 4 12 20 28 36 44 and 52 a light chain variable region CDR1 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 6 14 22 30 38 46 and 54 a light chain variable region CDR2 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 7 15 23 31 39 47 and 55 and a light chain variable region CDR3 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 16 24 32 40 48 and 56 wherein the antibody specifically binds NS2B NS3 proteinase of West Nile Virus.

Additionally or alternatively an antibody can be engineered by modifying residues within the constant region s for example to alter the effector function s of the antibody. One type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the VH and or VL CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding properties e.g. affinity of the antibody of interest known as affinity maturation.

As used herein the term affinity refers to the strength of interaction between a molecule comprising an antigen binding moiety and an antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site the variable region of the antibody arm interacts through weak non covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites the more interactions the stronger the affinity.

The term binding specificity as used herein refers to the ability of an individual antibody combining site to react with only one antigenic determinant. The combining site of the antibody is located in the Fab portion of the molecule and is constructed from the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains. Binding affinity of an antibody is the strength of the reaction between a single antigenic determinant and a single combining site on the antibody. It is the sum of the attractive and repulsive forces operating between the antigenic determinant and the combining site of the antibody. The phrases an antigen binding moiety recognizing an antigen and an antigen binding specific for an antigen are used interchangeably herein with the term an antigen binding which binds specifically to an antigen .

The term conservatively modified variant applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance the codons GCA GCC GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are silent variations which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid except AUG which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine and TGG which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.

For polypeptide sequences conservatively modified variants include individual substitutions deletions or additions to a polypeptide sequence which result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants interspecies homologs and alleles of the invention. The following eight groups contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Glycine G 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W 7 Serine S Threonine T and 8 Cysteine C Methionine M see e.g. Creighton Proteins 1984 . In some embodiments the term conservative sequence modifications are used to refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence.

The terms identical or percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Two sequences are substantially identical if two sequences have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same i.e. 60 identity optionally 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 99 identity over a specified region or when not specified over the entire sequence when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Optionally the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides or 10 amino acids in length or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides or 20 50 200 or more amino acids in length.

As used herein the term high affinity for an IgG antibody refers to an antibody having a KD of 10M or less 10M or less or 10M or 10M or less for a target antigen. However high affinity binding can vary for other antibody isotypes. For example high affinity binding for an IgM isotype refers to an antibody having a KD of 10M or less or 10M or less.

The term Kassoc or Ka as used herein is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody antigen interaction or general a binder ligand interaction whereas the term Kdis or Kd as used herein is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody antigen interaction. The term K as used herein is intended to refer to the dissociation constant which is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka i.e. Kd Ka and is expressed as a molar concentration M . Kvalues for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A method for determining the Kof an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance or using a biosensor system such as a Biacore system. For inhibitory antibodies the term Ki or K is used. Ki or K is equivalent to term K but is as mentioned generally only used for inhibitory molecules such as the antibodies of the present invention.

The present invention provides methods of treating a subject infected with West Nile Virus by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of the antigen binding moiety of the invention.

In certain embodiments the present invention provides methods of reducing or eliminating the symptoms of a subject infected with West Nile Virus by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of the antigen binding moiety of the invention.

Subjects to be treated with therapeutic agents of the present invention can also be administered other therapeutic agents with know methods of treating conditions associated with West Nile Virus infection. When the therapeutic agents of the present invention are administered together with another agent the two can be administered sequentially in either order or simultaneously. In some aspects an antigen binding moiety of the present invention is administered to a subject who is also receiving therapy with a second agent.

In certain embodiments the present invention provides the use of an antigen binding moiety an antibody or an antibody fragment according to the present invention for the prophylaxis or treatment of an infection with West Nile Virus. In other embodiments the present invention provides a method for preventing or treating an infection with West Nile Virus said method comprising administering an antigen binding moiety an antibody or an antibody fragment according to the present invention to a patient infected or suspected to be infected with West Nile Virus.

In one aspect the invention encompasses diagnostic assays for determining NS2B NS3 proteinase and or nucleic acid expression as well as NS2B NS3 proteinase function in the context of a biological sample e.g. blood serum cells tissue or from individual is afflicted with a disease or disorder or is at risk of developing a disorder associated with West Nile Virus infection.

In certain aspects the present invention provides the use of an antigen binding moiety an antibody or an antibody fragment according to the present invention for diagnosing or monitoring infection with West Nile Virus. In other aspects the present invention provides a method for diagnosing or monitoring an infection with West Nile Virus said method comprising detecting West Nile Virus via an antigen binding moiety an antibody or an antibody fragment of the present invention.

Diagnostic assays such as competitive assays rely on the ability of a labeled analogue the tracer to compete with the test sample analyte for a limited number of binding sites on a common binding partner. The binding partner generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and analyte bound to the binding partner are separated from the unbound tracer and analyte. This separation is accomplished by decanting where the binding partner was preinsolubilized or by centrifuging where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction . The amount of test sample analyte is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose response curves with known amounts of analyte are prepared and compared with the test results in order to quantitatively determine the amount of analyte present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers. In an assay of this form competitive binding between antigen binding moieties and C5 binding antigen binding moieties results in the bound NS2B NS3 proteinase preferably the NS2B NS3 proteinase epitopes of the invention being a measure of antigen binding moieties in the serum sample most particularly neutralising antibodies in the serum sample. A significant advantage of the assay is that measurement is made of neutralising antibodies directly i.e. those which interfere with binding of NS2B NS3 proteinase protein specifically epitopes . Such an assay particularly in the form of an ELISA test has considerable applications in the clinical environment and in routine blood screening.

In the clinical diagnosis or monitoring of patients with disorders associated with West Nile Virus infection the detection of NS2B NS3 proteinase in comparison to the levels in a corresponding biological sample from a normal subject is indicative of a patient s infection with or exposure to West Nile virus.

The invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which diagnostic assays prognostic assays pharmacogenomics and monitoring clinical trials are used for prognostic predictive purposes to thereby treat an individual prophylactically.

The invention also provides for prognostic or predictive assays for determining whether an individual is infected with West Nile virus or is at risk of developing symptoms of West Nile Virus infection after exposure to the virus or after having had contact with other subject with West Nile Virus infection. Such assays can be used for prognostic or predictive purpose to thereby prophylactically treat an individual prior to an infection with West Nile Virus.

Another aspect of the invention provides methods for determining NS2B NS3 proteinase nucleic acid expression or NS2B NS3 proteinase protein activity in an individual to thereby select appropriate therapeutic or prophylactic agents for that individual referred to herein as pharmacogenomics . Pharmacogenomics allows for the selection of agents e.g. antigen binding moieties of the present invention for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of an individual based on the genotype of the individual e.g. the genotype of the individual examined to determine the ability of the individual to respond to a particular agent. 

Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to monitoring the influence of agents e.g. antigen binding moieties of the present invention on the expression or activity of NS2B NS3 proteinase in clinical trials.

The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties intact or binding fragments formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions can additionally contain one or more other therapeutic agents that are suitable for treating or preventing West Nile Virus infection or symptoms associated with West Nile Virus infection. Pharmaceutically carriers enhance or stabilize the composition or to facilitate preparation of the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like that are physiologically compatible.

A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. The route and or mode of administration vary depending upon the desired results. It is preferred that administration be intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal or subcutaneous or administered proximal to the site of the target. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should be suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous parenteral spinal or epidermal administration e.g. by injection or infusion . Depending on the route of administration the active compound i.e. antigen binding moiety antibody bispecific and multispecific molecule may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.

The composition should be sterile and fluid. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by use of coating such as lecithin by maintenance of required particle size in the case of dispersion and by use of surfactants. In many cases it is preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol and sodium chloride in the composition. Long term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate or gelatin.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared in accordance with methods well known and routinely practiced in the art. See e.g. Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Mack Publishing Co. 20th ed. 2000 and Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems J. R. Robinson ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1978. Pharmaceutical compositions are preferably manufactured under GMP conditions. Typically a therapeutically effective dose or efficacious dose of the NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moiety is employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moieties are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response e.g. a therapeutic response . For example a single bolus may be administered several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level depends upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed or the ester salt or amide thereof the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors.

A physician or veterinarian can start doses of the antibodies of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general effective doses of the compositions of the present invention for the treatment of an allergic inflammatory disorder described herein vary depending upon many different factors including means of administration target site physiological state of the patient whether the patient is human or an animal other medications administered and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Treatment dosages need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. For systemic administration with an antibody the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg kg and more usually 0.01 to 15 mg kg of the host body weight. An exemplary treatment regime entails systemic administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months. For intravitreal administration with an antibody the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to about 10 mg. An exemplary treatment regime entails systemic administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months.

Antigen binding moieties and antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be weekly monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of NS2B NS3 proteinase binding antigen binding moiety in the patient. In some methods of systemic administration dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of 1 1000 g ml and in some methods 25 500 g ml. Alternatively antigen binding moiety can be administered as a sustained release formulation in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half life of the antigen binding moiety in the patient. In general humanized antibodies show longer half life than that of chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.

The pyroglutamic acid RTKR 7 amino 4 methylcoumarin Pyr RTKR AMC fluorescence quenched cleavage peptide was purchased from Bachem King of Prussia Pa. . Goat anti human F ab 2 fragment conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was from AbD Serotec Oxford UK .

Unless indicated otherwise all experimental procedures were performed using standard protocols essentially as described in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3 Vol. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory December 2000 .

Earlier studies have indicated that the presence of the 48 residue central NS2B domain linked to the N terminus of NS3 via a flexible linker GGGGSGGGG is required for the catalytic activity of NS3pro J Biol. Chem. 279 48535 48542 . A K48A mutation in the C terminal amino acid residue of the NS2B sequence inactivates the autolytic cleavage site. As a result the NS2BNS3pro K48A mutant is resistant to autoproteolysis and is represented by the intact single chain NS2B NS3pro construct. In another WNV mutant H51A the histidine residue at the catalytically essential position 51 is substituted alanine. This H51A mutant is catalytically inert and is not autocleaved.

cDNAs of two WNV strains were used in this study. cDNA of WNV strain NY99 was kindly provided by Drs. Richard Kinney CDC Fort Collins Colo. . cDNA of WNV strain of the DV serotype 2 DV2 strain 16681 was kindly provided by Michael Diamond Washington University St. Louis Mo. . NS3pro from these two strains share a 50 sequence identity. Although the number of amino acid substitutions proximal to the catalytic triad is minimal the two proteinases display significant differences in their substrate cleavage preferences what is also reflected in the sequence and the structure of the active site region.

Strain NY99 has a threonine residue at position 52 where as strain DV2 has a valine residue at this position. At position 76 strain NY99 has an arginine residue whereas DV2 has a leucine residue. To explore the potential role of the Thr52 and Arg76 residues we constructed chimeric proteins with T52V and R76L mutations. Additional mutants we were created in NS2B of NY99 a G22S mutation and a triple DDD AAA mutation at positions 32 34 a region which might affect either the folding or the interactions of NS2B with NS3pro in the proximity of the active site region or both. Sequence of NS2B and NS3pro for both WNV strains are depicted in including the mutations generated in the present study.

WNV strain DV2 cDNA was used in PCR reactions followed by routine gene engineering manipulations to generate the DV2 NS2B NS3pro constructs which included the 48 residue NS2B cofactor amino acids 1393 1440 linked via a nona peptide linker GGGGSGGQQ to the NS3pro part amino acids 1476 1687 . Similarly the NY99 cDNA was used to generate the WNV NS2B NS3pro constructs which included the 48 residue NS2B cofactor amino acids 1423 1470 linked via a GGGGSGGGG linker to the NS3pro sequence amino acids 1506 1689 J. Virol. 81 4501 4509 . The design and purification of the autolytic site deficient WNV NS2B NS3pro K48A construct the H51A T52V and R76L mutants with the amino acid substitutions in the NS3pro part and the G22S and Asp32Asp33Asp34 Ala32Ala33Ala34 mutants DDD AAA with the mutations in the NS2B cofactor sequence were described earlier Protein Expr Purif. 52 334 339 J. Virol. 81 4501 4509 J Gen Virol. 89 636 641 . The sequence of the constructs is shown in . The constructs were re cloned into the pET101 DTOPO expression vector Invitrogen Carlsbad CA .

Competent BL21 CodonPlus DE3 RIPL cells Stratagene were transformed with the individual recombinant pET101 D TOPO vectors. Transformed cells were grown in LB broth at 37 C. to reach A600 0.6. Protein expression was then induced at 37 C. using 1 mM isopropyl Dthiogalactoside for an additional 6 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation resuspended in 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 containing 1 M NaCl and 1 mg ml lysozyme and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The NY99 and DV2 constructs were purified from the supernatant fraction using HiTrap Co2 chelating chromatography. The 6 His tagged NS2B NS3pro constructs were eluted using a 0 500 mM gradient of imidazole. Fractions were analyzed using SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining and also by Western blotting with an anti 6 His antibody Clontech .

Wild type DV and NY99 NS2B NS3pro as well as NY99 DV chimeras were expressed in with C terminal His tags and isolated from the soluble fraction by metal chelating chromatography.

The cleavage kinetics of all constructs were measured in an Pyr RTKR AMC cleavage assay employing a fluorogenic peptide. This assay for NS2B NS3pro peptide cleavage activity was performed in 0.2 ml 20 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 20 glycerol and 0.005 Brij 35. The cleavage peptide Pyr RTKR AMC and enzyme concentrations were 25 M and 10 nM respectively. Reaction velocity was monitored continuously at 360 nm and 460 nm on a Spectramax Gemini EM fluorescence spectrophotometer Molecular Devices Sunnyvale Calif. . All assays were performed in triplicate in wells of a 96 well plate. The concentration of catalytically active NS2B NS3pro samples was measured using a fluorescence assay by titration against a standard aprotinin solution 5 nM Biochem J. 393 503 511 . The concentration of active NS2B NS3pro was close to 100 when compared to the protein concentration.

Three of the NY99 mutants K48A H51A K48A G22S and K48A DDD AAA had no activity because the G22S and DDD AAA mutations affect the interactions of the NS2B co factor with the NS3pro domain and the H51A mutation inactive the proteinase.

The purified constructs were used as baits in the antibody selection and characterization procedures.

In this invention a novel screening approach for the generation of high affinity inhibitory human antibodies that specifically target the active site region was employed. This approach comprises screening against the active site of an enzyme in the present case a wild type proteinase. In a second step a counter screen is performed against a mutated enzymatically non active form of the enzyme in the present case a proteinase mutant with a single H51A mutation in the active site. By doing so we successfully isolated selective and potent function blocking active site targeting antibodies to WNV NS2B NS3pro.

Recombinant antibodies were generated from the HuCAL GOLD collection of human antibody genes J Mol. Biol. 376 1182 1200 by three rounds of selection panning on immobilized recombinant NS2B NS3pro protein as previously described J Immunol Methods. 275 203 212 Biol. Chem. 387 995 1003 J Mol. Biol. 296 57 86 J Immunol Methods. 254 67 84 J Biol. Chem. 278 38194 38205 . Prior to selection the phage library was blocked with NS2B NS3pro H51A protein in order to deplete antibodies which are specific for epitopes also present on the immobilized antigen.

To identify the Fabs capable of binding the active site region of WNV NS2B NS3pro we used a bio panning procedure that involved both the catalytically active NS2B NS3pro K48A construct with the intact active site sequence and the inert NS2B NS3pro H51A mutant with the inactivated active site.

First we identified those Fab clones which efficiently interacted with the NS2B NS3pro K48A construct. Among these several hundred positive Fabs we then identified those individual antibodies which did not interact with the H51A active site mutant. As a result of the bio panning of the HuCAL GOLD library seven individual antibodies were identified. Results for some of these binders are shown in . All seven binders were capable of binding the wild type enzyme but incapable of binding the active site mutant. Results for some of these binders are shown in .

After sequencing the DNA inserts the sequences of the seven individual Fabs AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05322 AbD05323 AbD05444 AbD05445 and AbD05446 were determined and the coding sequences were expressed in . Sequences of all heavy and light chains as well as of the CDRs are shown in Table 2. The seven antibodies were isolated from the respective recombinant cells and the purified antibody samples were characterized further.

To determine if the antibodies are resistant to NS2B NS3pro proteolysis the purified antibody samples 4 g 8 M each were co incubated for 2 h at 37 C. with the purified NS2B NS3pro K48A construct 1 g 1.4 M an enzyme substrate molar ratio 1 6 in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 20 v v glycerol and 0.005 Brij 35. The digest samples were separated by 4 20 gradient SDS PAGE. Antibodies AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05322 and AbD05323 antibodies were completely resistant to NS2B NS3pro proteolysis.

To determine the inhibitory potency of the antibodies increasing concentrations of purified AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05322 AbD05323 AbD05444 AbD05445 and AbD05446 samples were each co incubated for 60 min at ambient temperature with NS2B NS3 K48A 50 nM . The residual proteolytic activity of the protease was then measured using the Pyr RTKR AMC fluorescent peptide substrate. A near complete inhibition of the proteolytic activity of NS2B NS3 K48A was observed at a 300 nM concentration of AbD05320 AbD05322 AbD05323 AbD05444 and AbD05445 while AbD05321 and AbD05446 were less inhibitory. Results are depicted in .

To analyze the inhibitory characteristics of the antibodies in more detail we determined the Ki values of the antibodies. For these purposes NS2B NS3 K48A 10 nM was pre incubated with the increasing concentrations of the antibodies for 60 min at ambient temperature in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 20 v v glycerol and 0.005 Brij 35. The Pyr RTKR AMC substrate 24 M was then added to the 0.1 ml reactions. We then have determined the Ki values of AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05322 AbD05323 AbD05444 AbD05445 and AbD05446 to be 264 400 170 31 58 35 and 288 nM respectively. To do so the NS2B NS3pro constructs 50 nM were pre incubated with increasing concentrations of the antibodies for 30 min at ambient temperature in 0.1 ml 20 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 20 glycerol and 0.005 Brij 35. The Pyr RTKR AMC substrate 25 M was then added in 0.1 ml of the same buffer. All assays were performed in triplicate in wells of a 96 well plate. Ki values were determined by routine kinetics software. Results are depicted in .

To determine if the antibodies selectively bind the NY99 and DV constructs we used a Western blotting procedure. The purified WNV K48A H51A T52V R76L G22S and DDD AAA constructs 100 ng each were added to the soluble protein fraction 20 g total protein and the samples were analyzed by Western blotting with the AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05322 AbD05323 AbD05444 AbD05445 and AbD05446 antibodies followed by a goat IgG F ab 2 fragment conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a TMB M substrate. The Western Blot is shown in . While the G22S and DDD AAA mutations in the NS2B cofactor did not significantly affect the binding efficiency of the antibodies the presence of H51A T52V and R76 mutations in the active site region of NS3pro significantly decreased the binding efficiency of the AbD05322 Ki 170 nM AbD05323 Ki 31 nM and AbD05444 Ki 58 nM with the WNV constructs. AbD05323 and AbD05444 were able to bind the wild type WNV proteinase but they were totally inactive with the H51A T52V and R76L mutants which exhibited mutations in the active site region. Four antibodies AbD05320 AbD05321 AbD05445 and AbD05446 significantly cross reacted with the H51 and other mutants. The Kvalues of the antibodies against the wild type WT and mutant WNV NS2B NS3pro are summarized in Table 3.

To corroborate these data using the native proteinase constructs rather than partially denatured ones as in the Western blotting experiments we performed an assessment of the antibody binding with the NY99 and DV constructs using ELISA.

Wells of a Nunc Immuno MaxiSorp 96 well flat bottom plate Thermo Fisher Scientific Rochester N.Y. were coated in triplicate for 18 h at 4 C. using the NY99 or DV constructs 0.1 ml well 1 g ml . Control wells were coated with 1 g ml BSA. After washing with PBS unspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation with 0.2 ml 1 BSA 2 h room temperature . The wells were then washed using PBS 0.05 Tween 20. The 2 g ml antibody solution 0.1 ml in PBS 1 BSA 0.05 Tween 20 was added to the wells. After a 2 h incubation at room temperature the wells were washed using PBS 0.05 Tween 20. Goat anti human F ab 2 fragment conjugated with horseradish peroxidase 1 5.000 dilution in PBS 1 BSA 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS 0.1 ml was then added to the wells and incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS 1 BSA 0.05 Tween 20 and incubation with 0.1 ml of the TMB Super Sensitive One Component HRP Microwell Substrate solution BioFX Owings Mills Md. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.05 ml of 1 N HCl and the intensity of the color reaction was measured at 450 nm using a Spectra Fluor Plus fluorescence plate reader Tecan M nnedorf Switzerland .

Remarkably none of the selected anti NY99 antibodies recognized the closely related DV proteinase. Because AbD05323 and AbD05444 did not interact with the H51A R76L and T52V contracts these two antibodies were clearly different when compared to the other anti NY99 antibodies analyzed. Overall based on our data we concluded that the AbD05323 and AbD05444 antibodies target in a highly selective and focused manner the active site region of the two component WNV NS2B NS3 proteinase. Results are shown in .

Trypsin like matriptase and flaviviral proteinases are structurally similar. Because both enzymes are serine proteinases the level of this similarity is especially high in the active site region. Both matriptase and WNV NS2B NS3pro require the presence of Arg at the P1 substrate position. The structure of the complex of matriptase with the inhibitory human Fab was recently solved J Mol. Biol. 380 351 360 J Mol. Biol. 369 1041 1051 . 2 resolution crystal structure of a Fab antibody inhibitor k 15 pM in complex with matriptase reveals the molecular basis of its picomolar potency and specificity. This anti matriptase E2 Fab is similar to the anti WNV AbD05323 Fab 79 homology which we selected for structure optimization studies. Anti WNV NS2B NS3pro AbD05323 Fab however is a less potent inhibitor k 30 nM . We hypothesized that using the atomic resolution structure of the trypsin like matriptase serine proteinase with the E2 Fab antibody inhibitor and the atomic resolution structure of NS2B NS3pro as a guide can be used to re engineer the hypervariable loop of the AbD05323 Fab.

Because of the presence of Arg Arg in the hypervariable loop the E2 Fab is a 15 M inhibitor of matriptase. Our modeling results indicate that the binding affinity of the AbD05323 Fab can be dramatically increased by replacing the original Leu 108 Asn 109 and Asp 110 sequence of the hypervariable loop with the sequence Arg Arg Ala Ser Gly. See . Antibodies with these mutant sequences will allow the hypervariable loop of the modified AbD05323 to enter the binding pocket of NS2B NS3pro. This modified antibody is a particular highly potent inhibitor of this viral proteinase.
