This invention relates to measuring force and displacement exerted by a tire. More particularly the invention is for a device and method for measuring and characterizing the force and displacement exerted by a rotating tire through near surface depths in different soil aggregate compositions that could detonate a buried explosive charge.

Currently a most dangerous weapon encountered by operational forces is the Under Vehicle Victim Operated Improvised Explosive Device VOIED . This devastating weapon of choice accounts for considerable injuries and fatalities of both military forces and local civilians alike.

Typically a VOIED has a main explosive charge connected to a mechanically actuated triggering mechanism that are both buried under a roadway. The triggering mechanism is actuated when the tires or tracks of a vehicle depress a pressure plate a predetermined distance to initiate detonation of the main charge.

Today s adversary combines imagination with limited available resources to arbitrarily construct a triggering mechanism that usually has a mechanically displaceable pressure plate connected to a wide selection of different items on hand. Consequently there is little to no consistency in the designs of the encountered trigger mechanisms or as otherwise stated no two triggers are identical. This lack of consistency increases the complexity of developing standard countermeasures.

Current countermeasure test initiatives to combat the problem of VOTED conduct go no go functionality testing against simulated devices. But because of the lack of repeatability in trigger design the current initiatives reduce the confidence placed on go no go testing. Another complication arises in that the simulated trigger of today will most likely be different than the one encountered tomorrow. Rather than react to the constantly changing threat military tacticians and planners need to counter the threats with proactive insightful means to develop vehicle threat profiles estimate countermeasure capabilities and provide vital insight into the soil dynamics for varying conditions e.g. different types of aggregate speeds and weight of vehicles etc. .

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a hydrostatic force displacement measuring device capable of measuring and characterizing the force and displacement exerted by rotating tires in different soil aggregate compositions in near surface depths.

The present invention provides a hydrostatic force displacement measuring device to measure the force and displacement exerted by a rotating tire in soil aggregate. The measuring device has a hydrostatic actuation assembly having a pressure plate at near surface depths of soil aggregate to provide hydrostatic pressures in a liquid representative of force and displacement created by the downward forces exerted by a rotating tire in the soil aggregate at the near surface depths. A hydrostatic hose transmits the hydrostatic pressure forces in the liquid to a surface manifold assembly. The surface manifold assembly receives the hydrostatic pressure forces and has a gauge providing visual readouts of the hydrostatic pressure forces representative of the downward forces. The surface manifold assembly also has an axially displaceable piston defining an interface chamber. The piston is connected to an electronic sensor to provide visual readouts representative of displacements caused by the downward forces at near surface depths in the soil aggregate. The surface manifold assembly further has a spring constant cylinder containing an internal chamber coupled to the interface chamber and has an axially displaceable piston to define the internal chamber. A valve extends through the spring constant cylinder and into the internal chamber to selectively feed gas to and from the internal chamber to selectively increase and decrease its internal gas pressure and a shaft axially extends from the displaceable piston where a pair of lock members engage the axially extending shaft to selectably fix the volume of the internal chamber in the spring constant cylinder. The electronic sensor has a potentiometer with a sliding contact mechanically coupled to the axially displaceable piston to provide the visual readouts representative of displacements caused by the rotating tire. The valve enables the selective transfer of pressurized gas to and from the internal chamber of the surface manifold assembly and the lock nuts enable the selective engagement of the axially displaceable shaft of the spring constant cylinder to create a visual readout in the electronic sensor that corresponds to a distance of displacement of a predetermined trigger mechanism at the force indicated on the read out gauge.

An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus to measure and characterize the force and displacement exerted by a rotating tire through near surface depths of the ground between 1 to 12 inches in varying soil conditions.

Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for developing dynamic characterization profiles for vehicles traveling over the ground under varying conditions.

Another object of the invention is to provide planners and tacticians a better understanding of means for countering VOIEDS in operational environments.

Another object of the invention is to provide a relatively low cost portable and expendable hydrostatic force measuring device that would eliminate the need to expose personnel in the field to make such determinations.

Another object of the invention is to provide vehicle and countermeasure dynamic profiles with environmental conditions soil dynamics and the projected threat profiles anticipated threat to enable better prediction of operational threat levels identification of possible mission impact and determination of measures to reduce eliminate or counter the threat of VOIEDS.

Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus to collect soil dynamic and vehicle countermeasure profile characterization data to provide vital insight in forecasting mission vehicle threat levels.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Referring to hydrostatic force displacement measuring device of the invention is capable of measuring and characterizing the force and displacement exerted by a rotating tire or track on a mechanized vehicle in a variety of soil aggregate compositions through near surface depths extending between 1 to 12 inches. Contemporary tests testing systems and analysis take into account only the amount of force on a trigger mechanism that is required to initiate detonation of an interconnected explosive of a typical threat VOIED. Unlike the conventional systems and analyses force displacement device of the invention takes into account not only the amount of detonating force but also records the amount of displacement of a pressure plate or equivalent structure of the triggering mechanism in the characterization of the force and displacement exerted by a rotating tire. Determining and allowing for the two factors of force and displacement that are required to initiate detonation more accurately characterizes the threat of the VOIED in a variety of soil aggregate conditions to allow more responsive measures.

In accordance with the development of force displacement measuring device of the invention it was observed that a rotating tire of a transitional vehicle or roller type countermeasure exerts a transitional downward force. A portion of the transitional downward force is absorbed by the soil aggregate covering and or surrounding the trigger mechanism that is sought to be displaced by a pressure plate of a VOIED and as a result the basic pressure plate functionality of a typical VOIED was affected by the surrounding soil. This is because the soil absorbs or redistributes the greater portion of the total downward force to possibly prevent adequate displacement of the trigger and avert mechanical contact detonation of the VOIED. Consequently it was discovered in the course of development of this invention that understanding the force displacement dynamics associated with different soil aggregates under different conditions and how they might affect detonation will prove very insightful for future analyses and designs.

The basic force displacement function otherwise referred to as spring resistance of a mechanically actuated triggering mechanism of a VOIED is graphically displayed in . The two variables associated with this functionality are the dependent variable displacement shown on the ordinate and the independent variable force shown on the abscissa. Initial force F represents the force required to initiate pressure plate compression of a triggering mechanism the compressible distance is the displacement D of the components of a triggering mechanism that are necessary to make mechanical contact Z to complete electrical contact in the triggering device and the total force F is what is required to overcome the mechanical resistance of the mechanism to make the mechanical contact Z complete compression and cause the VOIED to detonate. The curve extending from F to Z is referred to as the spring resistance curve or force displacement curve and is different for each of the differently constructed triggering mechanisms of each VOIED.

Hydrostatic force displacement measuring device of the invention includes a hydrostatic actuation assembly a hydrostatic hose and a surface manifold assembly . Measuring device takes into consideration and can accommodate the forces and pressures to activate different triggering mechanisms to allow a collection of soil dynamic and vehicle countermeasure characterization data that may be useful for further developments.

Hydrostatic actuation assembly is the underground hydrostatic pressure vessel that captures conveys and translates the transitional forces A exerted by rolling tire as it passes over the top of its laterally extending pressure plate . Pressure plate is a strong flat rigid structure made of steel in the preferred embodiment that transmits transitional downward forces A exerted by the moving tire . Pressure plate is located at near surface depths ranging from one to twelve inches deep in the soil aggregate material of the ground. There is no soil aggregate material in the space or volume beneath pressure plate that might otherwise interfere with its downward displacement. Pressure plate can be resized to represent the dimension of various pressure plate threats i.e. differently sized and or weighted wheeled or tracked vehicles.

Referring also to actuation assembly has three rigid plungers connected to the bottom of pressure plate to transmit the downward transitional forces A to an incompressible liquid inside an actuation manifold . The incompressible liquid can be a non hazardous 10 dish soap and water solution to reduce environmental concerns and fluid surface tension.

Actuation manifold has three hollow essentially cylindrically shaped members held in compression by a plurality of elongate bolts extending through and connected to a rigid upper plate not shown in for clarity and a rigid lower or base plate . The three hollow members define three manifold chambers filled with liquid . Base plate functions as the base of measuring device and rests on soil aggregate material for measuring forces applied to hydrostatic actuation assembly . Like top pressure plate base plate is modifiable in size to represent the current threat of interest.

A high stretch high abrasion latex upper membrane is secured to and extends across the upper open end of each manifold chamber . Each latex membrane is a high strength high abrasion 800 stretchable membrane made of inch latex which provides near zero friction and high seal strength to reliabily displace liquid and thereby transmit the transitional downward force from plungers to responsively pressurize liquid . shows latex membranes being downwardly deflected by plungers that have been pushed downwardly by pressure plate as a rotating tire passes overhead and the pressurizing force is being applied to liquid .

The lower open end of each manifold chamber has a portion of coextensive latex lower membrane extending across them of essentially the same composition as upper membranes to seal the lower juncture of hollow members and lower plate Membranes and between upper and lower plates and and hollow members of actuation manifold thereby contain the fluid pressures of liquid that are representative of the transitional forces of tires . These hydrostatic pressure forces in liquid are transmitted via tubular sections that interconnect manifold chambers and extend between hollow members . A hydrostatic hose connected to one of the manifold chambers extends to surface manifold assembly having a read out gauge see to permit real time visual monitoring of these hydrostatic pressure forces associated with the effects of soil aggregate interactions.

Referring also to surface manifold assembly provides the mechanism for collecting dynamic characterization data from the transitional downward forces A created by transitional tire . Manifold assembly also is capable of replicating the spring constant or in other words the combination of both the required force and amount of displacement needed to effect contact or detonation of a particular trigger mechanism of a particular VOIED. As will be explained herein surface manifold assembly can replicate different trigger mechanisms associated with different VOIEDS when they might be used in different soil aggregates being examined.

Surface manifold assembly includes a tubular shaped interface cylinder connected to hose to receive the representative hydrostatic pressurized liquid . Pressurized liquid inside cylinder axially displaces a piston which in turn compresses compressible air or any other compressible gas in interface chamber on the other side of piston inside of cylinder . The compressed air is fed through a duct extending from interface chamber in cylinder to an internal chamber in a spring constant cylinder . Piston of interface cylinder is also mechanically coupled to displace the sliding contact of a potentiometer of an electronic sensor via a mechanical linkage . This interconnection of electronic sensor to piston by linkage provides an electrical signal readout representative of the extent of displacement of piston when it is displaced by the force and volume of pressurized liquid . A stabilized power supply is coupled to electronic sensor to maintain constant non fluctuating current necessary for accurate output measurements.

Spring constant cylinder establishes and maintains a representative spring constant force curve of distance and force required to initiate or detonate a particular pressure plate trigger mechanism. Spring constant cylinder has compressible air on one side of its axially displaceable spring piston . A Schrader valve is provided in the wall of spring constant cylinder to allow selective changing of the pressure of pressurized air in internal chamber as needed to replicate different triggering mechanisms.

For example increasing the pressure of air in chamber via valve has the effect of requiring a greater amount of pressure in pressurized liquid more force to displace piston to compress air in interface chamber and internal chamber to equalize the pressures on both sides of piston . This greater amount of force correlates to a greater amount of force or pressure being required to be exerted by pressurized liquid to detonate a trigger mechanism being simulated. On the other hand if the pressure of air in chamber of spring constant cylinder is decreased via valve a lesser amount of pressure in pressurized liquid will be needed to equalize the pressures on both sides of piston in interface cylinder . This lesser amount of force correlates to a lesser amount of force or pressure being required to be exerted by pressurized liquid to detonate a VOIED trigger mechanism threat being simulated.

Surface manifold assembly can also replicate the amount of displacement required by a particular trigger mechanism. An axially extending shaft of surface manifold assembly has a pair of adjustable lock nuts that can selectably engage shaft at predetermined positions so that a fixed structural guide can restrict the amount of axial displacement of shaft where it slides through fixed guide . Adjusting the locations of where lock nuts engage shaft creates a visually observable location that corresponds to a particular volume of internal chamber that has been created in surface manifold assembly . This particular volume of internal chamber correlates to a displacement distance needed to initiate detonation of a particular threat trigger mechanism being simulated in manifold assembly . Selectably increasing the size of internal chamber caused by withdrawing spring piston to the right will require additional displacement of piston by increased volumes of pressurized liquid from actuation assembly . This additional displacement of piston equalizes the pressure of pressurized liquid on one side of piston in cylinder to the pressure of gas in interface chamber on the other side of cylinder to conform to the displacement required to initiate a particular trigger mechanism threat being simulated.

On the other hand if the size of the internal chamber in spring constant cylinder is reduced less displacement of spring piston is required to initiate another different trigger device mechanism being simulated. In other words this relative displacement is representative of a displacement needed to initiate contact and detonation of a trigger mechanism threat being simulated. The observable extension of shaft is an accurate measurement of the volume of air inside internal chamber at the predetermined amount of force that needs to be exerted to initiate a specific explosive trigger mechanism.

Hydrostatic force measuring device of the invention provides military planners a better understanding of the effectiveness of soil aggregate interactions for responsive countermeasure determinations of threats in an operational environment. Hydrostatic force measuring device of the invention provides easily deployed man portable means to record meaningful data associated with countering VOIEDS to allow a determination of the effectiveness of countermeasures in different operational environments. The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Therefore hydrostatic force measuring device of the invention as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.

It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
