This present application claims priority to a U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 219 261 entitled Systems and Methods for Stateful Session Failover Between Multi Core Appliances filed on Jun. 22 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for maintaining operation of sessions by multi core intermediaries providing service between clients and servers upon failover.

An enterprise may provide a service to users accessing servers from client machines via intermediaries deployed by the enterprise between the clients and servers. The intermediaries may manage and control the network traffic to enhance the user experience. Sometimes one or more intermediaries may be unavailable. When intermediaries become unavailable service such as session service to users may be disrupted.

The present solution is directed to ensuring that the client server persistence information on the primary appliance is honored by a peer or secondary appliance in the event of a failover. To accomplish this A Stateful Session Failover module dynamically pushes session information such as LB persistence sessions from primary appliance to secondary appliance. In the Multi processor MP context all sessions created on the primary appliance are distributed among a plurality of cores. The total sessions in the multi core system thus is a cumulative set of all sessions from each core. The task of the SSF module thus is to sync the sessions owned by each core across the secondary. A master or designated core on the primary appliance takes responsibility for sending all sessions from all the cores of the primary appliance to the secondary appliance. On the secondary any core may take or establish the connection with the SSF module from the primary and process the SSF messages and create sessions on the secondary appliance.

On the primary system the first core or core 0 may be assumed to initiates a connection to the secondary. Sessions are synced to the secondary appliance on a timer. Each core or packet engine on a core updates the first core with session information based on expiration of the timer. When the timer expires if any unsent sessions exist the primary appliance walks through the list of sessions from the cores and synchronizes them to the secondary appliance. Each core when the timer expires packages all the stateful session failover messages and sends a message to the master core. The message either contains the stateful session failover content or has the location in a shared memory space where the content exists. Upon receipt of this message the master core such as via the SSF module forwards the stateful session failover content to the secondary via a failover connection. Upon receipt of the SSF messages based on the ownership of the session that each record contains a message is sent to the appropriate core of the second appliance with the record. Each core then acts on the record as though it received from the primary directly.

The present application is directed towards systems and methods for maintaining operation or service provided by intermediaries operating on multi core platforms upon failover failure or detection of malfunction or unavailability of a primary intermediary. The present application may also be directed towards systems and methods for maintaining operation by a second multi core appliance upon failover of a first multi core appliance. The present application may be directed towards systems and methods for maintaining operation of a stateful session by a secondary appliance upon a failover of a primary appliance.

In some aspects the present application is directed to systems and methods for maintaining operation or functionality of a stateful session by a secondary multi core appliance upon a failover by a primary multi core appliance. Each core of a primary multi core appliance may maintain session states corresponding to each session managed by each core of the primary appliance. A stateful session failover module SSF module of the primary appliance may receive from each core of the primary appliance the session states in response to expiration of a timer. A SSF module of a secondary multi core appliance receives from the SSF module of the primary appliance the session states for sessions of the primary appliance. Each session state may comprise any information about a session such as a state a configuration a setting or any other session related information. The SSF module of the secondary appliance may assign a number of sessions and corresponding session states of the primary appliance to a plurality of cores of the secondary appliance. The SSF module of the primary appliance may receive from each of the cores of the primary appliance updated session states or new session states responsive to expiration of the timer. The SSF module of the secondary appliance may receive from the SSF module of the primary appliance the updated session states. In some embodiments the SSF module of the secondary appliance receives the session states that comprise data that was updated. In further embodiments the SSF module of the secondary appliance receives all of the session states from each of the cores. The SSF module of the secondary appliance may forward or propagate the updated session states to each of the cores of the secondary appliance. The updated session states may be forwarded to the cores of the secondary appliance based on the assignment of the corresponding sessions. In some embodiments the updated session states are forwarded to the cores of the secondary appliance based on the assignment of the corresponding session states.

In some aspects the present application is directed to a method for maintaining operation upon failover from a first multi core appliance to a second multi core appliance. A secondary appliance having a plurality of cores may receive from a primary appliance having a plurality of cores information about a configuration and operation of a plurality of packet processing engines PPEs of the primary appliance. In some embodiments each PPE operates on each of the plurality of cores of the primary appliance. A first core of the secondary appliance may monitor a status of operation of the plurality of PPEs of the primary appliance.

In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

In other embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of an appliance or a single device the functionality may be deployed across multiple devices in any arrangement. For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The has function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined bases on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores .

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system.
