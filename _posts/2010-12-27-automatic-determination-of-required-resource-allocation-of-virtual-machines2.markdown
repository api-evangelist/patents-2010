The entire contents of each of the above mentioned applications are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Embodiments of The invention relate to analyzing network traffic analysis and in particular to performing automatic determining of resource allocation among virtual machines operating in service groups within a communications network.

Traditionally enterprises are comprised of various nodes that contribute to an overall business process. An enterprise may be thought of as a geographically dispersed network under the jurisdiction of one organization. It often includes several different types of networks and computer systems from different vendors.

These network nodes that are part of the enterprise may be comprised of both physical and virtual machines. Enterprise networks that include a plurality of virtual machines may require a physical host which is required to allocate resources among the virtual machines. Allocating resources to these virtual machines may pose a challenge especially with regard to over allocating and under allocating resources. Examples of resources may include memory disk usage CPU usage etc. Too few resources allocated and the virtual machine will not provide the resources necessary to complete a business process. Too many resources allocated and resources may be wasted causing inefficiencies to occur in the enterprise network. Resource allocation should be dynamic and based on the present operating conditions of the enterprise network and its corresponding virtual machine s and physical host s .

One example embodiment of the present invention may include a method of monitoring performance of a virtual machine operating in a network. The method may include monitoring the virtual machine operating in the network to determine whether at least one predefined service tier threshold has been exceeded for a predefined amount of time. The method may also include initiating a query to determine current performance threshold data of the at least one predefined service tier threshold from a database and determining at least one component state of at least one component of the virtual machine based on the at least one service tier threshold assigned to the at least one component. The method may also include reallocating at least one resource provided by the virtual machine when the at least one component state indicates a high warning state.

Another example embodiment of the present invention may include an apparatus for monitoring performance of a virtual machine operating in a network. The apparatus may include a processor configured to monitor the virtual machine operating in the network to determine whether at least one predefined service tier threshold has been exceeded for a predefined amount of time. The apparatus may also include a transmitter configured to transmit a query to a database to determine current performance threshold data of the at least one predefined service tier threshold. The processor is further configured to determine at least one component state of at least one component of the virtual machine based on the at least one service tier threshold assigned to the at least one component and reallocate at least one resource provided by the virtual machine when the at least one component state indicates a high warning state.

It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus the following detailed description of the embodiments of a method apparatus and system as represented in the attached figures is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed but is merely representative of selected embodiments of the invention.

For example the usage of the phrases example embodiments some embodiments or other similar language throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus appearances of the phrases example embodiments in some embodiments in other embodiments or other similar language throughout this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments and the described features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

In addition while the term message has been used in the description of embodiments of the present invention the invention may be applied to many types of network data such as packet frame datagram etc. For purposes of this invention the term message also includes packet frame datagram and any equivalents thereof. Furthermore while certain types of messages and signaling are depicted in exemplary embodiments of the invention the invention is not limited to a certain type of message and the invention is not limited to a certain type of signaling.

Specific example embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being connected or coupled to another element it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. Furthermore connected or coupled as used herein may include wirelessly connected or coupled. It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms.

According to an example embodiment elements of system may utilize the Java software platform and Enterprise Java Bean EJB architecture to provide certain functionality. These well known terms may be used in the description that follows. Other software platforms and architectures providing similar functionality may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.

System may consist of an application server which interacts across a network with a number of data collection agents . Application server may be an element of an administrative console AC that also provides a suite of network management tools. A system administrator may perform network traffic analysis and or other network management tasks by accessing application server through a web browser . Application server may include an EJB module an ontological description creation engine and a web application . Web browser may include a rendering engine B and a knowledge browser A.

In operation data collection agent s may be deployed onto network nodes including physical and or virtual machines in an enterprise information technology IT infrastructure environment. After such deployment application server receives messages from data collection agents . These messages may include data representing for example state and relationship information about the network nodes configuration information related to the IT infrastructure performance utilization data and network communication. Thresholds are assigned to a component and or can also be assigned to an entire business application service group BASG . A host may provide CPU usage as a resource allocated to a virtual machine the CPU operational usage performance is an example metric. The virtual machine and host machine are both examples of components.

The received messages may be initially handled by EJB module . For example message driven EJB may initially inspect a received message. A received message relating to network traffic or node status may be forwarded by message driven EJB to the business logic EJB . Business logic EJB may call network traffic analysis engine for messages relating to network traffic. Alternately infrastructure messages i.e. those messages relating to node status may be forwarded directly to the state and profiling engine .

Messages forwarded to the state and profiling engine may undergo sorting and processing. The state and profiling engine for example may identify the entities within the IT infrastructure as well as their dependency on one another based on messages received from the platform. In addition state and profiling engine may perform further processing to determine the state of one or more entities. State may be based on a threshold that has been defined for example by the system administrator. The threshold may be based on a metric that either exceeds or underperforms in a specific area of interest of the system administrator. An example threshold may be set for a server operating in the enterprise network that is exceeding a specified CPU utilization percentage a disk utilization percentage and or a memory utilization percentage.

A data output from state and profiling engine may be sent to ontological description creation engine . Initially the data may be handled by a resource description framework RDF application programming interface API knowledge base where the data is categorized and stored utilizing a predefined entity relationship determined by ontology web language OWL API or ontology model .

Messages handled by the network traffic analysis engine may include source to destination data qualified by a communicating application within the operating system of the originating node as well as frequency of communication information. This received data is analyzed by processing the number and type of connections to determine if an ontological communicates with relationship exists. A determination may be made by tracking the number of connections of a specific application over a period of time. The period of time may be preselected for example by the system administrator.

Data output from network traffic analysis engine may be sent to ontological description creation engine . Initially the data may be handled by the RDF API knowledge base where the data is categorized and stored utilizing a predefined entity relationship determined by OWL API ontology model . For example OWL API ontology model may define what entity classes exist their possible relationship to each other and their possible state.

The model and structure the system uses to create and update the knowledge base is contained within a web ontology language OWL file present on the application server . OWL is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies which are a formal representation of the knowledge by a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Ontologies are used to represent the properties of a domain and may be used to describe the domain. The ontology provides the direct and indirect dependency information that the SPARQL query engine requires in order to infer the impact a change in state will have on the rest of a service group or BASG.

In an enterprise network a business application will typically include a primary application with one or more executables that execute on one or more nodes of the network. These nodes may have direct and indirect dependencies on other nodes of the network. The business application may be described by a network ontology. When an alert state occurs for the business application the components of the business application ontology may be analyzed to determine what adjustments are required to achieve a steady state based on assigned thresholds. The root cause may be a direct or indirect root cause which may then be reported to the system administrator.

According to an example embodiment a visualization of a current network state and or communication activity may be provided to an administrator. The system administrator may be provided with a visual rendering e.g. on a computer monitor of the knowledge base. The visualization may be filtered to any selected entity of interest. For example referring again to the system administrator or other user may use a web browser to request rendering of data via web application from controllers .

Controllers may pass along any filtering information such as a specific Host ID. Next business logic EJB may be called by the controllers. Business logic EJB may query RDF API knowledge base for requested data. The requested data may be returned through controllers to the web browser. The requested data may then be converted into a directed graph chart by a rendering engine.

Example embodiments of the present invention may provide the ability to automatically determine allocation adjustments that may be required for virtual machine performance and monitoring the service tier thresholds assigned to a specified virtual machine. Thresholds are directly related to a node state . The state may be defined as an indicator to the system and the user of a business application service such as whether the business application service meets a specified threshold requirement. The process to determine the state of an individual element may be based on a threshold that has been defined for example by the system administrator. The threshold may include a metric that either exceeds or underperforms in a specific area of interest of the system administrator. An example would be a server in a network that is exceeding a specified CPU utilization percentage.

Example embodiments of the present invention may provide automatically detecting when a virtual machine s baseline of performance requires an allocation change from the virtual machine s host. Determining the percentage of increase or decrease in CPU usage memory usage storage usage and network usage may be required in order to maintain a baseline operating in a normal range.

The system may monitor for a steady state of a virtual machine by tracking service tier thresholds identified as normal. The system will provide the virtual machine s host with the changes in performance allocations needed to operate within a normal range to continue or achieve a normal range. The adjustment is expressed in terms of a percentage increase or decrease from the present allocation of resources assigned to it by its physical host.

The following terminology is used only to distinguish one element from another element. Thus for example a first user terminal could be termed a second user terminal and similarly a second user terminal may be termed a first user terminal without departing from the teachings of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. The symbol may also be used as a shorthand notation for and or .

Networks including computer entities physical and or virtual machines operating on network nodes etc. may be advantageously described via an ontology that describes the operational usage and current state of the entities rather than being based on a fixed IT infrastructure architecture. The ontological description may be automatically and dynamically updated based on data acquired from data collection agents deployed to the nodes of the network. The data collection agents observe communicative relationships based on connections between nodes in operational use while annotating a class state. Using the ontological description a network analyst or system operator may be provided with an improved ability to analyze network traffic.

Data relating to actual connections may be acquired automatically in near real time. For example an actual connection may be monitored in an interrupt driven way while collecting information regarding an application that made the connection. Moreover a volume for the connections may be derived. A software based data collection agent may be received by a computing device at a node within a communications network. The agent may be distributed to one or more nodes from a central node via the network.

Once the software based data collection agent is received it may be inserted in an operating system of the receiving node. Advantageously the agent may be inserted in the kernel of the operating system or in a user space i.e. an area in virtual memory of a computer that contains user applications that execute at the application layer . The installation may be performed such that it is transparent or undetectable by a user of the node. The installed data collection agent may monitor data packet traffic between an adaptive driver layer and a protocol layer and report results of the monitoring to the central node.

In one example the data collection agent may have an interface to an operating system s network stack and may periodically determine what applications are using the network stack. As a result the data collection agent may track information regarding a network connection the connection duration and any applications and systems involved in the connection. Moreover the data collection agent may normalize the foregoing information and report it to an administration console so that different operating systems may be correlated by the administration console.

As a further example the data collection agent may include a network filter inserted into the network stack to determine exactly when a connection is made between entities. The filter component of the data collection agent may be inserted at one or more layers of the OSI model. For example a data collection agent may have a filter interface at the transport layer and or a filter interface at the network layer. The data collection agent may track information regarding a network connection the connection duration and any applications and systems involved in the connection. Moreover the data collection agent may normalize the foregoing information and report it to the administration console so that different operating systems may be correlated by the administration console.

As yet a further example the data collection agent described in the preceding paragraphs may also include a packet filter inserted into the network stack to track connection data. For example a data collection agent may have a filter interface at the data link layer. Then the data collection agent may correlate and normalize if required data from the network filter and the packet filter to track information regarding the network connection the connection duration any applications and systems involved in the connection connection status and connection resource usage information. Moreover the data collection agent may normalize the foregoing information and report it to the administration console so that different operating systems may be correlated by the administration console.

Referring again to an illustrative system for deploying data collection agents onto network nodes monitoring network connections instantiated at each network node acquiring resulting data automatically creating an ontological description of the network from the acquired data and dynamically updating the ontological description will be described. The system may further be used for monitoring configuration drifts within an enterprise network as will be described in more detail below. In an example embodiment elements of system utilize the Java software platform and Enterprise Java Bean EJB architecture to provide certain functionality and these well known terms may be used in the description that follows.

According to example embodiments of the present invention the process to automatically determine a performance allocation may begin by monitoring those virtual machines that have sustained a service tier threshold in either a critical low and or a critical high level for more than 24 hours. Such an observation may be observed by the virtual machine agent. The SQARQL query engine simultaneously initiates a query for current performance threshold data stored in a database.

The components states may be determined since they have thresholds that include at least one of achieved overachieved and or underachieved. Nodes executables and the business application service groups BASGs may also incorporate status and alerts from infrastructure providers. The executables may have a state that relates to the communicates with relationship. For example if an executable such as sqlservr.exe no longer communicates with node X it may be designated critical high and indicated on a user interface as red or as a warning. This example may be true of a node that represents a communicates with relationship as well as a primary application represented as a node.

The state and profiling engine may set the state of the business application service group BASG using the agent data and system information. When any component of the BASG has achieved a High Warning state the user may view the component as red indicating a high warning as well as the BASG itself being displayed in red on a graphical user interface of .

The process to determine the state of an individual element may be based on a threshold s that has been defined for example by the system administrator. The threshold may include a metric that either exceeds or underperforms in a specific area of interest to the system administrator. An example would be a server operating in a network that is exceeding a specified CPU utilization percentage.

According to one example a CPU threshold may be established via menu option . Service tier thresholds may include various different levels such as a low error threshold a low warning threshold a high warning threshold and a high error threshold. Similarly a menu option may be used to modify thresholds for disk space utilized. These various threshold levels may be established automatically and or manually by a system administrator. The user may select a threshold window that the system may use to monitor operational usage.

According to one example if the user sets a red zone red to be between 90 100 CPU usage then the state of the node in question will be set to a red if the operational usage condition of 90 100 occurs 3 times within 5 minutes or a similar set of occurrences . The threshold is set by the user per the high error threshold of 90 usage. Similarly a high warning threshold of 80 may be set to create an orange zone warning at 80 or more CPU usage which may be used to merely notify the system administrator that a first threshold has been exceeded. On the flip side the low CPU usage may be monitored by a low performance threshold including a low warning threshold and low error threshold set at 20 and 10 respectively. Similar operational parameters may be established to monitor disk usage and other metrics not shown.

The states of the individual business application service components may be aggregated to calculate an overall state for the BASG. Any support nodes within the BASG ontology that have achieved a high warning alert may be labeled under the BASG as having a high warning. If any one node with a communicates with relationship achieves a high warning status it is identified as having a high warning for its associated BASG. High errors may be identified in a similar manner. For example in order for a node to achieve one of these identified states the states must have been observed and processed by the state and profiling engine three times within one hour. As a result spurious errors and random faults will not lead to warnings being generated for the overall business application process.

One example method for processing state information of elements of a business process ontology and more specifically for a BASG that is in an error state will now be described with reference to . The method of may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware e.g. circuitry dedicated logic programmable logic microcode etc. software such as instructions run on a processing device firmware or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the method is performed by a server e.g. application server of .

At operation a query is sent to the RDF knowledgebase that identifies the BASG that is currently in an error state. The RDF knowledge base returns the list of components of the BASG e.g. hardware nodes virtual nodes executables processes primary applications etc and their present state.

It should be noted that the primary application of the BASG is considered by the RDF knowledge base to be a node. Any of these components of the BASG may have independent thresholds assigned by the system administrator. Examples of components may include virtual machines host machines storage devices network devices etc. Examples of resources that are allocated to the components may include memory CPU storage disk space network adapters etc. Examples of metrics may include a CPU utilization of 1024 Ghz a memory utilization of 8 gigabytes a network adapter operating at 100 Mbps etc.

At operation a filter is applied to determine those components that may have contributed to the high warning threshold that was exceeded and which in turn triggered an alarm. In one example embodiment the filter omits any individual component that has not exceeded a high warning threshold individually from the process. This may reduce the chances of false alarms occurring due to random instances of a predefined threshold being exceeded.

At operation the process continues by inspecting each of the filtered components to determine a root cause. The inspection process looks up performance data previously reported by the agents deployed to the nodes. The inspection process may yield all of the component s relevant data for determining a root cause. In one example the data used for this determination process is service tier data such as CPU memory disk and network operation threshold roll up data last 30 days etc. although other relevant data may also be used.

The root cause process may also use virtualization infrastructure alarms and network status updates. These are available to the system for host virtual machines disks and network devices and may be sent in messages from a proxy agent. The proxy agent may contain an instruction for translating virtual infrastructure messages to a format that the state and profile engine can process. If for example the proxy agent receives a message from the virtual infrastructure indicating a disk has achieved full capacity and has an error level of 3 the proxy agent will modify the received message with a translation on the level of 3 to High Error. This is then sent to the message driven bean factory where an EJB is created with the contents received from the proxy agent. The business logic then routes the new state EJB to the state and profiling engine data for the executables. This is provided to the user as evidence for the root cause conclusion.

The SPARQL query engine determines the state of the primary applications and the contributing executables that make up the primary application by requesting the ontology for the business application service. The ontology is analyzed for breaks in communication with nodes as described in the Applicant s co pending applications referenced above.

The SPARQL query engine will send a request to the agent to send back the performance statistics of the executables that make up the primary application of the business application service. This will provide the user with the real time performance statistics of the executables to provide support for a conclusion that a root cause of failure is due to the failure of the primary application support nodes at operation . The result of conclusion may automatically trigger a recommendation to perform an increase and or decrease in the present resource allocation of resources provided by a virtual machine s at operation . For example CPU resources and disk space may be reallocated from among the network resources by the system administrator as a result or receiving the recommendation. Or alternatively certain reallocation measures may be performed automatically.

System may comprise an application server which interacts across a network with a number of data collection agents deployed in various nodes of the network. Advantageously application server may be an element of an administrative console AC that also provides a suite of network management tools. A system administrator may perform network traffic analysis and or other network management tasks by accessing application server by way of web browser . Application server may comprise an EJB module an ontological description creation engine and a web application .

Data collection agents as described through the specification may be deployed onto network nodes including physical and or virtual machines in an enterprise IT infrastructure environment. After such deployment application server receives messages from data collection agents . These messages may include data representing for example state and relationship information about the network nodes configuration information related to the IT infrastructure performance utilization data and network communication.

The received messages may be initially handled by EJB module . For example message driven EJB module may initially inspect a received message. A received message relating to network traffic or node status may be forwarded by message driven EJB to the business logic EJB . Business logic EJB may call network traffic analysis engine for messages relating to network traffic. Alternatively infrastructure messages i.e. those relating to node status may be forwarded directly to the state and profiling engine .

Messages forwarded to the state and profiling engine may then undergo sorting and processing. The state and profiling engine for example may identify the entities within the IT infrastructure as well as their dependency on one another based on messages received from the platform. In addition state and profiling engine may perform further processing to determine the state of one or more entities. The states may be based on a threshold that has been defined for example by the system administrator. The threshold may be based on a metric that either exceeds or underperforms in a specific area of interest to the system administrator. An example would be a server operating in a network that is exceeding a specified CPU utilization percentage. The threshold may be set to 80 CPU utilization and if the server is operating at 81 the threshold is being exceeded.

Example embodiments for determining a required resource allocation of a virtual machine based on thresholds are discussed below. The web application server business logic creates a message request to provide the necessary changes in virtual machine performance allocation variables to create a condition of no critical low and or no critical high conditions for the next 24 hours. If the recommended change is not successful the cycle repeats by incrementing the 24 hour period with no critical low and or no critical high warning by the service tier threshold system. Another 24 hour monitoring period may then begin.

A recommendation of a change in a variable by a factor of 10 increase or reduction may be a general modification used to satisfy a threshold condition that has been exceeded underperformed. The 10 factor modification may be used until the virtual machine exceeds a performance request which results in the web browser initiating a message to the web application and controllers of the virtual machine. This modification in turn creates a message driven entity bean that contains the request which is transferred to a rules engine. The rules engine sends a request to gather a historical period of information to the web browser . Such historical information may be for a period of 1 to 90 days. The rules engine not shown may be part of creation engine and or EJBs .

The rules engine message is sent to a database not shown to gather the data tables requested. The database sends the data back to the rules engine. The rules engine factors the data resulting in a recommendation to increase or decrease the allocation for each of the performance threshold criteria which may include for example CPU utilization memory utilization data storage utilization and network resource utilization.

The resource modification recommendation is created by the rules engine . The rules engine may perform averaging the actual threshold observed by the service tier threshold integer 0 100 scale . The average is only taken from metrics observed while the virtual machine is observed in its normal operating range. If no normal range is observed than the rules engine will increment the recommended change by increasing or decreasing the allocated resource s by 20 until a normal range is observed over a period of 24 hours. According to one example the recommended increase or decrease is only 10 for a period following 24 hours if the data gathered does contain normal range input data.

A proxy agent not shown may be part of the local agent that that is used to collect data. In operation the proxy agent collects data from the virtual infrastructure management provider. The user will utilize the default thresholds or adjust them as deemed necessary. Thresholds are used by the state and profile engine for tracking the state of the nodes that make up the components for a business application process. The inventory in the database may be updated by the proxy agent with a list of virtual machines storage hosts and network devices.

The agent may be deployed via the physical hosts connected directly to the virtual machine s O S. The state and profile engine assigns the state of the various network components and receives additional input from the proxy agent to factor into the state e.g. alarms network and communicates with relationship status and updates the RDF knowledge base ontologies to reflect the assignments. The agent tracks executable applications to see what other nodes are communicating with the virtual machines VMs in the enterprise.

The traffic analysis engine determines which executable applications and services are communicating with other nodes that constitute a communicates with relationship. A determination may be made as to whether any pairs of nodes have a communicates with relationship. Upon the assignment of a communicates with relationship to the ontology of a node and its direct and indirect relationships the state and profiling engine assigns the group of nodes as a service group. 

The RDF knowledge base contains an ontology for each individual node. The model and structure the system uses to create and update the knowledge base is contained within the ontology web language OWL file present on the application server . The state and profiling engine tracks the state continually of the components and receives additional input from the proxy agent to factor into the state e.g. alarms network and communicates with relationship status .

The user may identify a service group of network nodes as a business application service group BASG by selecting a name for the group of nodes and the executables that are the basis for the communicates with relationship. The user may also add nodes that the system did not auto detect as a component of the service group. Those added nodes will be recorded and stored in the ontology model .

A determination may then be made as to whether the user has assigned additional nodes and or names to the service group. The ontology itself provides the direct and indirect dependency information of the nodes that the SPARQL query engine requires to infer the impact a change in state will have on the rest of the service group. For instance if a storage device s component state is changed to RED because it is almost full e.g. only two gigabytes left of a 1500 gigabyte memory then this may cause the physical host to start the paging memory which will effect the performance of any and all virtual machines running on that physical host.

The SPARQL query engine parses the service group ontology for the components that have a communicates with relationship which forms the basis for a primary application. The state and profiling engine tracks the state of the BASG by requesting the current state from the RDF knowledge base and updating the ontology when any new messages are received from the business logic EJB factory . The ontology itself provides the direct and indirect dependency information the SPARQL query engine requires to infer the impact a change in state will have on the rest of the BASG. SPARQL query engine parses the BASG ontology for the components that have a communicates with relationship which forms the basis for a primary application.

According to one example SPARQL query engine provides a list of candidate BASG members for base lining and adjusting as needed to achieve normal acceptable performance levels. By parsing the BASG ontology for primary applications that have communicates with relationships with virtual machines that have operated in a normal level of threshold for 3 consecutive business cycles a list of qualifying components may be produced.

Example embodiments for determining a required resource allocation of a virtual machine based on thresholds are depicted in the flow diagrams of . The method of may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware e.g. circuitry dedicated logic programmable logic microcode etc. software such as instructions run on a processing device firmware or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the method is performed by a server e.g. application server of .

The SPARQL query engine determines the performance allocation by monitoring those virtual machines that have sustained or operated within a service tier threshold in either a critical low and or critical high state for more than 24 hours or an appreciable amount of time see operation of . The service tiers are assigned to a given user configuration and or a default threshold configuration.

The SQARQL query engine simultaneously initiates a query for current performance threshold data in a database see operation . The components states are determined relative to predefined thresholds to determine whether an achieve over achieve or under achieve status is present see operation . Nodes executables and the business application service groups BASGs may also incorporate status and alerts from infrastructure providers. The executables may have a state that relates to the communicates with relationship. Status and alerts are provided by the virtual infrastructure vendors and are received via the proxy module in the local agent . Example statuses and alerts may include network failure disk full and any messages or changes in status tracked by an external hypervisor such as an ESX server or a MS hyper V.

The state and profiling engine sets the state of the business application service group using the agent data and system information see operation . In one embodiment when any component of the BASG has achieved a high warning state the user sees the component as red indicating high warning as well as the BASG as red in a graphical user interface. The process to determine the state of an individual element may be based on a threshold that has been defined. The threshold may include a metric that either exceeds or underperforms in a specific area of interest to the system administrator.

A recommendation of a resource allocation adjustment of a variable by a factor of 10 may be performed by transmitting an adjustment variable see operation of . The rules engine sends a request to gather historical information for a predefined period of time selected at the web browser such as for a period of 1 to 90 days. The rules engine message is sent to the database to gather the data tables requested. The database sends the data back to the rules engine which uses the data to create a recommendation to increase or decrease the allocation for each of the performance threshold criteria CPU usage memory usage storage usage and network parameters see operation .

The recommendation is created by the rules engine averaging the actual threshold observed by the service tier threshold integer 0 100 scale . For example if the average CPU usage is 70 in one 24 hour period and 100 for a second 24 hour period an average actual threshold may be 85 . The average is only taken from metrics observed while the virtual machine is observed in the normal range. If no normal range is observed then the rules engine will increment the recommended change to increase or decrease by 20 until a normal range is observed over the following 24 hours. The recommended increase or decrease change is only 10 for the following 24 hours if the data gathered contains normal range input data.

The SPARQL query engine sends a request to the middle ware that then initiates a message to the web server to send a web service data interface message to initiate the change in resource allocation see operation . A determination is then made as to whether the change in the resource allocation was successful see operation . If not the cycle repeats by incrementing the 24 hour period with no critical low and or no critical high warning by the service tier threshold system see operation . If the change was successful the process ends.
