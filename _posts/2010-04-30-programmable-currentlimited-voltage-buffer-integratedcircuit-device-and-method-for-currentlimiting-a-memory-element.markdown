For purposes of the following discussion a first rail of a power supply is at a positive potential with respect to ground and a second rail of a power supply is at a negative potential with respect to ground however embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such polarities of the first and second rails of a power supply as other polarities and different potentials with respect to ground are within the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention when appropriate changes in the polarities and biasing of the circuit components subsequently described are provided for.

A configuration of various circuit blocks within the programmable current limited voltage buffer is next described.

With reference now to in accordance with embodiments of the present invention a block diagram shows an example programmable current limited voltage buffer . As shown in the programmable current limited voltage buffer is shown without the row line over current detection circuit described above in the interest of simplifying the discussion. However a programmable current limited voltage buffer including the row line over current detection circuit that is configured to output an over current signal if an integrated row line power output from the inverter exceeds a threshold value that is at a safe margin below a value at which irreversible damage may occur in the memory element is within the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention. illustrates a functional arrangement of circuit blocks in the programmable current limited voltage buffer that is configured to limit current flowing through at least one memory element as shown in . In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the programmable current limited voltage buffer includes at least one current bias circuit an inverter a write current set control circuit and an adaptive current limiter . The current bias circuit is coupled to a first rail of a power supply. The inverter is coupled to the current bias circuit and a reference voltage source and is configured to couple a row line of a memory element to either the current bias circuit or the reference voltage source in response to an input signal. The adaptive current limiter is coupled to the current bias circuit and to the write current set control circuit and is configured to limit current flowing through the memory element in a write operation of the memory element .

With further reference to in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the block diagram shows a circuit block of an example of the current bias circuit that includes without limitation thereto a current mirror which may be used in the programmable current limited voltage buffer . By way of example without limitation thereto in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the current mirror may include two p channel enhancement mode metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFETs the gates of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled together in common and the sources of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are also coupled together in common. The common gates of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled to one lead of the current bias circuit which is coupled to the adaptive current limiter in common with a first node . The common sources of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled to lead which is coupled to the first rail of the power supply for example the electrical buss line for V. The drain of one p channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to a lead which is coupled to the inverter . The drain of the other p channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to the common gates of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs and to the lead that is coupled to the adaptive current limiter in common with the first node .

With further reference to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the circuit configuration of the two p channel enhancement mode MOSFETs provides a current mirror which limits the available current provided from the first rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V to the inverter in proportion to a control current that flows to first node of the adaptive current limiter . Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the current available to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and from the output line of the inverter that is coupled to the row line which may be provided from the first rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V is limited by the action of the current mirror in proportion to the control current that flows to first node of the adaptive current limiter .

With further reference to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the block diagram shows a circuit block of an example of the inverter that is configured to couple at least one memory element for example one of memory elements and on row line to at least one of the current bias circuit and the reference voltage source in response to an input signal applied to the inverter for example the row line driver enable signal on row line driver enable line A. By way of example without limitation thereto in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the inverter may include a p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and a n channel enhancement mode MOSFET the gates of the p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and the n channel enhancement mode MOSFET are coupled together in common and the drain of the p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and the drain of the n channel enhancement mode MOSFET are coupled together in common. The source of p channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to a lead of the inverter that is coupled to the current bias circuit . The source of n channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to a lead of the inverter which is coupled to the reference voltage source . The common gates of the p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and the n channel enhancement mode MOSFET are coupled to row line driver enable line A through the inverting input buffer . The drain of the p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and the drain of the n channel enhancement mode MOSFET which are coupled together in common are coupled town output line of the inverter which is coupled to the row line . The circuit configuration of the p channel enhancement mode MOSFET and the n channel enhancement mode MOSFET as shown in provides an inverter which applies a voltage to a memory element for example one of memory elements and that are coupled to the inverter through the row line .

With further reference to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention for a binary digital input signal for example a bit string of ones and zeroes applied to row line driver enable line A the inverter applies a voltage which has the same polarity as the polarity of the voltage of the input signal to the row line coupled to the inverter and drives the voltage on the row line of the inverter towards one or other voltages of the first rail of the power supply or the reference voltage source . In one embodiment of the present invention the same polarity of the input signal to the row line driver enable line A and the output signal to the row line is provided by inverting input buffer . As used herein the phrase drives the voltage on the row line of the inverter towards one or other voltages of the first rail of the power supply or the reference voltage source does not necessarily imply that the voltage on the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter actually saturates at one or the other of these voltages as there may be a voltage drop between the sources of these voltages and the leads to the inverter for example due to the action of the current mirror included in the current bias circuits .

Thus with further reference to in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the voltage available from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and may be controlled for example a positive voltage to produce a low resistance ON state in the memory element which is suitable for digital computing. On the other hand in another embodiment of the present invention a multilevel logic application may adjust the resistance of the memristors in a gradual non binary way which may be done by a finer control of the write current and possibly the write voltage as well. To control the write current the inventors envision multiple versions of the block that could be switched in or alternatively the lower reference ground point of may be used as a control input of the programmable current limited voltage buffer . To control the write voltage the input to block labeled V in may be used as a control input of the programmable current limited voltage buffer with a multilevel input signal. However the row line driver enable A would not be used as an analog input to deliver a less strong write pulse. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the voltage available on the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and may be controlled for example an intermediate voltage to produce an intermediate resistance state in the memory element which is suitable for multilevel logic. At the same time that the voltage on the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is applied to the memory element for example one of memory elements and the current flowing to the memory element from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is limited by the action of the current mirror of current bias circuit in proportion to the control current that flows to the adaptive current limiter . Consequently in accordance with embodiments of the present invention an over current condition leading to current run away through a memory element for example one of memory elements and such as a memristor can be prevented from occurring during switching of the memory element such that the memory element is protected from short circuit damage.

Moreover a similar circuit not shown to that of the programmable current limited voltage buffer shown in but configured to provide a write voltage and a write current of equal polarity to the second rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V is also within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the voltage available from the row line coupled to the output line of an inverter similar to inverter to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and may be controlled for example a negative voltage to produce a high resistance OFF state in the memory element which is suitable for digital computing. Consequently in accordance with embodiments of the present invention an over current condition leading to current run away through a memory element for example one of memory elements and such as a memristor can be prevented from occurring during switching of the memory element such that the memory element is protected from short circuit damage.

Moreover although one lead of the inverter is shown tied to a reference voltage source at ground potential through the lead embodiments of the present invention encompassing a combination of the circuits described above for writing an ON state and an OFF state to a memory element for example memory element also include a reference voltage source sourced from a circuit similarly configured to the current bias circuit the write current set control circuit and the adaptive current limiter of the programmable current limited voltage buffer shown in but configured to provide a write voltage and a write current of equal polarity to the second rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V to that of the programmable current limited voltage buffer shown in . Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the voltage available from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and may be controlled for example a negative voltage to produce a high resistance OFF state in the memory element and a positive voltage to produce a low resistance ON state in the memory element which is suitable for digital computing. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the voltage available on the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and may be controlled for example an intermediate voltage to produce an intermediate resistance state in the memory element which is suitable for multilevel logic as previously described. At the same time that the voltage on the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is applied to the memory element for example one of memory elements and the current flowing to the memory element from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is limited by the action of the current mirrors of current bias circuit and an analogous current bias circuit of opposite polarity not shown in proportion to the control current that flows through the adaptive current limiter and an analogous adaptive current limiter of opposite polarity not shown . Consequently in accordance with embodiments of the present invention an over current condition leading to current run away through a memory element for example one of memory elements and such as a memristor can be prevented from occurring during switching of the memory element such that the memory element is protected from short circuit damage.

With further reference to in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the write current set control circuit includes an operational amplifier the operational amplifier configured to compare an output voltage of the row line against a write voltage reference level which in one embodiment of the present invention is a positive voltage level at half of a full write voltage level V for the memory element without limitation thereto the operational amplifier is also configured to set a current sourced to the row line from the current bias circuit to at least a half select current level i of the row line . As used herein the full write voltage level of a single memory element for example memory element may be designated by V or alternatively by V which is a positive definite value that is equal to an absolute value a positive voltage level at half of a full write voltage level may be designated by V or alternatively by V a negative voltage level at half of a full write voltage level may be designated by V or alternatively by V and the terms of art voltage and voltage level and current and current level respectively may be used interchangeably as well as respective symbols referring thereto.

With further reference to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the adaptive current limiter may include a current limiting element a first terminal of the current limiting element coupled to a first node which is coupled to one lead of the current bias circuit a write current limiter coupled to the first node and a sample and hold circuit coupled to a control node the control node coupled to a second terminal of the current limiting element . In an embodiment of the present invention the adaptive current limiter is configured to sum a half select current level i for the row line plus a current limited write current i and to limit a write current provided by the current bias circuit to the memory element written on the row line to a sum of the half select current level i for the row line plus the current limited write current i to write the memory element . In another embodiment of the present invention the adaptive current limiter may include a current limiting element selected from the group consisting of a current limiting resistor of fixed value as shown in a potentiometer an adaptive resistance and a switched capacitor see discussion of for more description of the latter embodiments . In another embodiment of the present invention the write current limiter may include a second current bias circuit A and a second current limiting element the second current limiting element B coupled to the second current bias circuit A and coupled to the first rail of the power supply such that the second current limiting element B is configured to limit a portion of the current drawn by the second current bias circuit A from the first node of the adaptive current limiter to the current limited write current i provided by the current bias circuit to the memory element written on the row line .

With further reference to in accordance with One embodiment of the present invention the block diagram shows a circuit block of an example of the second current bias circuit A that includes without limitation thereto a second current mirror which may be used in the programmable current limited voltage buffer . By way of example without limitation thereto in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the second current mirror may include two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs the gates of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled together in common and the sources of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are also coupled together in common. The common gates of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled to one lead of the second current bias circuit A which is coupled to the second current limiting element B. The common sources of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs are coupled to a lead that is coupled to the reference voltage source at ground potential which may be through the lead but not shown as such in . The drain of one n channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to a lead which is coupled to the first node through a transmission gate that is gated CLOSED and a channel of a FET that is used in the transmission gate is of low resistance when the current limiting enable signal on the current limit enable line B goes HIGH. The drain of the other n channel enhancement mode MOSFET is coupled to the common gates of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs and to a lead that is coupled to the second current limiting element B.

As used herein the terms of art CLOSED closed CLOSE or close refer to a state of the transmission gate as though the transmission gate were acting as a switch thus the terms of art CLOSED closed CLOSE or close refer to an FET that is used in a transmission gate in which the channel is in the high conductivity or ON state so that the analogous switch is closed. Similarly as used herein the terms of art OPENED opened OPEN or open refer to a state of a transmission gate as though the transmission gate were also acting as a switch thus the terms of art OPENED opened OPEN or open refer to an FET that is used in a transmission gate in which the channel is in the low conductivity or OFF state so that the analogous switch is opened.

With further reference to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the circuit configuration of the two n channel enhancement mode MOSFETs provides a second current mirror which increases the available current provided from the first rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V to the inverter depending on the amount of the current drawn by the second current bias circuit A from the first node of the adaptive current limiter by an amount equal to the current limited write current i. The effect of the second current mirror is independent of the other current being drawn out of node by the current limiting element which may be a resistor so that an increase in the current limit is above the current limit established by the write current set control to support the full row line of memory elements at the half select V voltage. Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the current available to switch the state of a memory element for example one of memory elements and from the output line of the inverter that is coupled to the row line which may be provided from the first rail of the power supply for example electrical buss line for V is limited by the action of the second current mirror depending on the amount of the current drawn by the second current bias circuit A from the first node of the adaptive current limiter to the current limited write current i.

With further reference to in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the block diagram shows a circuit block of an example of the second current limiting element B. In one embodiment of the present invention the second current limiting element B may include without limitation thereto a circuit element selected from the group consisting of a current limiting resistor of fixed value for setting a current limited write current for binary digital logic and a potentiometer of selectable resistance for setting a current limited write current of various levels for multilevel logic. More generally in accordance with embodiments of the present invention similar to current limiting element of the adaptive current limiter the second current limiting element B may also include a circuit selected from the group consisting of a limiting resistor as shown in a potentiometer an adaptive resistance and a switched capacitor see discussion of for more description of the latter embodiments .

With further reference to in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the block diagram shows a circuit block of an example of the sample and hold circuit . In one embodiment of the present invention the sample and hold circuit may include a capacitor and a voltage follower that are interconnected as shown in the circuit block of the sample and hold circuit the operational amplifier may be configured as a voltage follower as shown in . In one embodiment of the present invention the sample and hold circuit samples the output voltage from the write current set control circuit when the input signal applied on the current limit enable line B is LOW an inverting output of a input buffer with an inverting output and non inverting output provides an output signal that is HIGH when the input signal applied on the current limit enable line B is LOW the inverting output of the input buffer gates a transmission gate that is disposed between the sample and hold circuit and the write current set control circuit CLOSED when the current limit enable line B is LOW which charges the capacitor and allows the sample and hold circuit to sample the output voltage from the write current set control circuit . Thus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the half select current level i for the row line is drawn by the control node when a second transmission gate is also CLOSED when the current limit enable line B is LOW which interconnects the control node with the output from the write current set control circuit that is also interconnected with the sample and hold circuit when the current limit enable line B is LOW. In another embodiment of the present invention the current limit enable line B also goes HIGH but is delayed relative to the signal on the row line driver enable line A so that when the current limit enable line B is LOW the row line is allowed to mirror through current bias circuit the current drawn by the control node which is the half select current level i for the row line .

With further reference to in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention when the current limit enable line B also goes HIGH the non inverting output of the input buffer provides an output signal that is HIGH the inverting output of a input buffer then provides an output signal that is LOW and closes the two transmission gates that respectively interconnect the output from the write current set control circuit with the sample and hold circuit and the control node this action isolates the voltage on the capacitor of the sample and hold allowing that node to maintain or hold the output voltage of the write current set control . Also in an embodiment of the present invention a HIGH level on the non inverting output of the input buffer gates two transmission gates ON one of the transmission gates as described above which is connected between the first node and the write current limiter allows an extra amount of current equal to the current limited write current i to be drawn by the first node from the current bias circuit and another of the transmission gates which is connected between the control node and the sample and hold circuit maintains drawing the half select current level i by the sample and hold circuit . Thus in an embodiment of the present invention the current drawn by the row line to write the memory element for example one of memory elements or depending upon which is selected by a column line buffer is limited to the sum of the half select current level i for the row line plus the current limited write current i which prevents damage to the memory element being written.

With reference now to in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a circuit diagram shows a circuit block of a current limiting element which may be either of current limiting element and or second current limiting element B current limiting element is configured to limit current flowing through a memory element shown in . As shown in by way of example without limitation thereto in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention current limiting element includes an adaptive resistance for example a potentiometer that is configured to limit current flowing through the memory element for example one of memory elements and . In one embodiment of the present invention the current limiting element may include an active circuit having a control input that allows the active circuit to behave like a potentiometer with a resistance value controlled by the control input essentially as an adaptive resistance. In one embodiment of the present invention in which current limiting element includes the current limiting element one lead of the potentiometer may be coupled to the lead of the adaptive current limiter in common with first node which is coupled to the current bias circuit and the other lead of the potentiometer may be coupled to the control node of the adaptive current limiter . In another embodiment of the present invention in which second current limiting element B includes the current limiting element one lead of the potentiometer may be coupled to a lead of the second current bias circuit A and the other lead of the potentiometer may be coupled to lead which is coupled to the first rail of the power supply for example the electrical buss line for V. Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the current flowing to the memory elements from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is limited by the action of the current bias circuit and the adaptive current limiter in proportion to the control current that flows to the first node of the adaptive current limiter determined by the currents drawn from the first node by the potentiometer for either of current limiting element and or second current limiting element B.

With reference now to in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention a circuit diagram is shown for a circuit block of yet another example of a current limiting element which may be either of current limiting element and or second current limiting element B the current limiting element is configured to limit current flowing through a memory element shown in . As shown in by way of example without limitation thereto in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the current limiting element includes a switched capacitor also referred to by the term of art switch cap that includes capacitor and first and second switches and respectively that is configured to limit current flowing through a memory element for example one of memory elements and . In one embodiment of the present invention one lead of the capacitor is coupled to ground the other lead of the capacitor is coupled in common to a second terminal of the first switch and to a first terminal of the second switch . As further shown in by way of example without limitation thereto in one embodiment of the present invention in which current limiting element includes the switched capacitor the first terminal of the first switch which may include gated complementary MOSFETs configured as a CMOS transmission gate not shown that open and close in response to a clock signal clock is coupled to lead of the switched capacitor which may be coupled to the lead of the adaptive current limiter in common with first node which is coupled to the current bias circuit and the second terminal of the second switch which may include gated complementary MOSFETs configured as a CMOS transmission gate not shown that also open and close in response to a clock signal clock is coupled to the other lead of the switched capacitor which may be coupled to the control node of the adaptive current limiter . By way of further example without limitation thereto in another embodiment of the present invention in which second current limiting element B includes the switched capacitor the first terminal of the first switch is coupled to lead of the switched capacitor which may be may be coupled to a lead of the second current bias circuit A and the second terminal of the second switch is coupled to the other lead of the switched capacitor which is coupled to lead which is coupled to the first rail of the power supply for example the electrical buss line for V. Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the current flowing to the memory elements from the row line coupled to the output line of the inverter is limited by the action of the current bias circuit and the adaptive current limiter in proportion to the control current that flows to the first node of the adaptive current limiter determined by the currents drawn from the first node by capacitor that may be determined by the closing of switches and in response to the frequency of the clock signal clock . In an embodiment of the present invention the switched capacitor is configured to limit a current from the current bias circuit to a half select current level i for the row line in response to a first clock frequency and to limit a current from the current bias circuit to a sum of the half select current level i for the row line plus a current limited write current i in response to a second clock frequency to write the memory element . Embodiments of the present invention may include a switched capacitor for either of current limiting element or alternatively second current limiting element B. If current limiting element includes switched capacitor other elements of the adaptive current limiter shown in such as the write current limiter and the sample and hold circuit may be dispensed with.

With reference now to C and D schematic diagrams A B C and D are shown that illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. As shown in embodiments of the present invention include at least one programmable current limited voltage buffer for example one of programmable current limited voltage buffers and which is shown abstractly in B C and D to drive one of the row lines for example row lines and of an array of memory elements for example memory elements and which are located at the crossings of the row lines and and the column lines and . In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the operation of the programmable current limited voltage buffer is fairly straightforward. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the programmable current limited voltage buffer takes an input voltage V which may be identified with the action of the row line driver enable signal on row line driver enable line A on the inverter of and buffers the input voltage V to an output voltage V which may be identified with the row line voltage on the row line of where the condition V V is subject to a current limit specified on the CL input identified with the signal on the current limit enable line B of . While the buffer symbol suggests the current limit is specified by a control voltage in this description a more abstract current specification is employed for the CL input for example i or alternatively none. The designation none will indicate that no current limit is in effect. If the load on the buffer causes the current limit to be exceeded at the output to maintain V then Vwill be lowered until the output current equals the designated safe current limited write current. Furthermore in accordance with embodiments of the present invention this overload condition will be signaled with a true logic level on the OV output signal identified with the over current signal output on the over current output signal line C of .

With further reference to in accordance with embodiments of the present invention operations in a method for current limiting and or protecting a memory element during switching of the memory element in an array of memory elements are next described. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention it may be assumed the array of memory elements is initially in a quiescent state with all row and column lines set to 0 volts and with voltage drops across the memory elements and of 0 volts as shown in . shows the programmable current limited buffers for example programmable current limited voltage buffers and of driving the row lines for example row lines and of respectively and simple buffers identified with the column line buffers and of driving the column lines for example column lines and of respectively. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the method includes the following operations with no current limit in effect driving the selected row line for example row line at V which produces voltage drops across the memory elements and of V volts as shown in sampling and holding the half select row line current i for example on a row line as also shown in setting the current limit of the programmable current limited voltage buffer of the selected row line for example programmable current limited voltage buffer of the selected row line to the previously measured half select current i plus a designated safe current limited write current i of a single device for example memory element as shown in and driving a selected column line for example column line selected from column lines and at V which produces a voltage drop across the memory element of V volts and a voltage drop across the memory elements and of V volts as shown in . At this point in the course of performing operations of the method an operation may be performed that has a number of variations which are next described.

With further reference to in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the method further includes performing one of the following operations variation 1 driving the row line buffer for example programmable current limited voltage buffer at V subject to a current limit i i for a fixed time period variation 2 driving the row line buffer for example programmable current limited voltage buffer at V until the current limit i iis reached as signaled on the OV output line identified with the over current output signal line C variation 3 driving the row line buffer for example programmable current limited voltage buffer at V until the current limit i i is reached as signaled on the OV output line identified with the over current output signal line C or until a fixed time period has elapsed and variation 4 driving the row line buffer for example programmable current limited voltage buffer at V for a fixed time period during which any OV indication is used by the selected column buffer for example the column line buffer as a signal to lessen the magnitude of its driven signal initially at V . In an embodiment of the present invention the variation which has the row line buffer driving V subject to the current limit i i for a fixed time period raises an issue which is next described. Assume the current limit i i is reached and the output voltage from the row line buffer for example programmable current limited voltage buffer begins to lower. Then the formerly half selected devices will draw less current than their allotment in the total current limit budget of i i. This condition would then permit the device being written for example the memory element to draw more than i consequently the written device current limit has been exceeded even though the total row line current has been kept under limit. In other embodiments of the present invention one method to circumvent this situation is to kill the write operation when the current limit is reached as in variations 2 and 3 . However in accordance with embodiments of the present invention some applications may provide that the device be written with the specified current for a fixed time period as is described in variation 4. Variation 4 reacts to a row line over current signal by lessening the column voltage for example on column line . Thus in one embodiment of the present invention variation 4 preserves the voltage across the half selected same row devices and hence the current through them and so preserves the written device current limit i.

Summarizing in light of the preceding discussion of referring once again to in accordance with embodiments of the present invention a detailed circuit implementation of the core functionality of the programmable current limited voltage driver is shown in . For clarity only a single ended positive voltage only implementation is shown in . The inventors have come to recognize that the circuit shown in can be easily adapted in analog circuit design to negative voltage or dual voltage sense operation as previously described. When the selected row line for example row line is driven at V with no current limit in effect the row line driver enable signal is asserted while the current limiting enable signal is still dormant. In this mode a voltage is driven out on the row line for example row line and a feedback circuit is used to ensure that this voltage is V . This feedback path involves the current limit setting of the driver which is thus set to exactly match the state dependent current load of the row line s memory elements for example memristors at the half select voltage V . When the current limiting enable signal is then asserted the control voltage that sets the current limit is effectively frozen by way of a sample and hold circuit . However an additional current source is enabled that increases the current limit by a measured amount for example by the current limited write current i thus embodiments of the present invention provide the current headroom for the selected device write operation which is initiated by asserting the column line driver enable. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention although provides an example of the programmable current limited voltage driver another embodiment of the present invention based on switched capacitors is also possible as previously described. For example when the selected row line for example row line is driven at V with no current limit in effect a switched capacitor may be used to measure the frequency of capacitor switching needed to maintain V on the row line . This half select frequency measurement is indicative of the row line current and could be held in a binary form. Then when the column line driver is enabled and the full write operation is begun a second capacitor switching frequency is measured. If this second frequency is greater than the half select frequency by more than a certain amount reflecting the single device write current the programmable current limited voltage driver would be able to signal a current overload condition. Any of the invention method variations 1 through 4 described above could then be utilized.

With reference now to in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a flowchart is shown of a method for current limiting a memory element during switching of the memory element in an array of memory elements. The method for current limiting the memory element during switching of the memory element in an array of memory elements includes the following. At a selected row line is driven to a positive voltage level at half of a full write voltage level V for the memory element without a current limit in effect. At a half select current i is sampled and held on the selected row line. At a programmable current of the programmable current limited voltage buffer is set for the selected row line to a sum of a previously measured half select current i of the selected row line plus a designated safe current limited write current i for the single memory element. At a selected column line is driven to a negative voltage level at minus half of the full write voltage level V for the memory element. At an operation is performed selected from the group of consisting of driving the selected row line to the positive voltage level at half of the full write voltage level V for the memory element constrained by a current limit ifor a fixed time period driving the selected row line to the positive voltage level at half of the full write voltage level V for the memory element until a current limit is reached as signaled by an over current signal driving the selected row line to the positive voltage level at half of the full write voltage level V for the memory element for a fixed time period during which an over current signal is sent to a column line buffer of the selected column line as a signal to lessen an absolute value of a drive voltage applied to the selected column line wherein a level of the drive voltage is initially at the negative voltage level equal to minus half of the full write voltage level V for the memory element.
