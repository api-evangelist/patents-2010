The presently disclosed subject matter was made with U.S. Government support by the Army Research Laboratory. Thus the United States Government has certain rights in the disclosed subject matter. The embodiments described and claimed herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

The embodiments of the invention described herein relate generally to combustors and to methods tests and devices for a multi functional fuel converter. In particular the embodiments relate to a multi functional converter based on catalytic combustion and electrostatic injection technologies.

The Army has a need for small portable power systems to support a range of operations including but not limited to being carried by a soldier or located in unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs remotely powered vehicles RPVs and unmanned ground vehicles UGV . Typically these power systems are battery operated and as such are limited with regard to power density payload and performance duration. Thus the use of combustion of energy dense liquid fuels such as for example ethanol 1 butanol and Jet Propellant 8 JP 8 in a compact manner is an attractive alternative to the battery option. Specifically these dense liquid fuels function in a catalytic micro combustor and combust at temperatures that can be used in energy conversion devices. However although micro combustors have the potential to outperform batteries the current technology is limited with regard to system run time and reliability due to inefficient fuel based energy conversion and poor fuel atomization at small flow rates e.g. 

It is widely known by those having ordinary skill in the art that there are two parameters critical to the process of miniaturizing a combustor time length scales for complete evaporation mixing and thermal management. Specifically the time and length scales are vital because complete evaporation must occur in order for the gas phase fuel and air to mix sufficiently for combustion on the catalyst. Further maintaining autothermal combustion at the microscale requires catalytic combustion to reduce the temperature of stable combustion. The catalyst material is key because different catalysts are more catalytically active i.e. have shorter reaction time scales than others and as such can produce higher catalytic conversions with lower surface areas. The smaller more effective catalysts require less space and can allow the reaction zone of the combustor to decrease in size thereby affecting the overall size of the combustor.

The optimization of catalysts has been a major area of research. In particular experiments have been conducted with catalysts composed of thermally stabilized ion exchanged zeolite palladium on stabilized alumina and catalysts doped with Cerium Ce and Nickel Ni to better prevent sulfur poisoning when using JP 8. It has been determined that catalysts can lower the activation barrier of a reaction thereby allowing the reaction pathway to occur at lower temperatures than homogeneous reactions. This is extremely advantageous because it allows for combustion temperatures ranging between 650 K and 850 K which are ideal for lead telluride PbTe thermoelectric devices. Conversely homogeneous gas phase flame combustion reactions of ethanol were carried out in the literature but typical reactor wall temperatures for these types of reactions can exceed 1200 K which is far too high for any economically viable energy conversion device. At these high temperatures construction materials for the microcombustor system may crack or melt and as such the choice of materials becomes limited.

Oxygenates such as ethanol and 1 butanol are energy dense and well known to have characteristics that are desirable to miniaturize conventional combustors with regard to catalytic combustion. For instance they are easily renewable from biomass and possess simple straight chain chemical structures. Further ethanol and 1 butanol both become liquids at room temperature and boil at 351.4 K and 390.7 K respectively. Additionally the two alcohols are single components not a combination of components having different boiling points and viscosities which consequently enable simpler evaporation and diffusion models when attempting to predict their behavior. Further they burn clean meaning complete combustion results in the production of COand water. Moreover it has been determined that both ethanol and 1 butanol are electrically conductive enough such that they can be injected using alternative fuel injection techniques including but not limited to electrospraying techniques.

Electrospraying techniques are generally techniques that employ electrostatics to disperse a liquid e.g. fuel or a fine aerosol mist thereof. Further the types of electrospraying techniques may include electrospraying in cone jet mode multi jet mode or charge injection methods using either a single nozzle electrospray ES or multiple nozzles i.e. multiplexed electrospray MES enable liquid atomization evaporation and mixing with the oxidizer at low temperatures. Low temperature fuel injection avoids pre combustion in the fuel air mixing zone e.g. where the ethanol boiling point 351.4 K flash point

Neither the combustion of ethanol nor 1 butanol poison the catalyst and consequently operation using a single catalyst can persist for longer periods of time than for instance with fuels having high sulfur content. Further the combustion of ethanol and 1 butanol are extremely exothermic and occur via Equations 1 and 2 respectively shown below CHCHOH 3O 2CO 3HO H 1407 kJ mol 1 CHCHCHCHOH 6O 4CO 5HO H 2713 kJ mol 2 

The equivalence ratio of a system defined herein as the ratio of the fuel to air oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel to air oxidizer ratio plays an important role in fuel conversion. Mathematically the equivalence ratio is represented as 

The value can be controlled by adjusting the amounts of fuel and or oxygen that are reacted. Having a value of unity 1 signifies a stoichiometric feed of fuel and air as shown in the above equations. With reactions having high values i.e. values ranging from 0.75 to 3 the reaction is considered fuel rich and incomplete combustion occurs because not enough oxygen exists to combust the fuel. However reactions having low values i.e. values ranging from 0 to 0.75 indicate reactions having a fuel lean environment with plenty of oxygen to oxidize the fuel into its combustion products carbon dioxide and water.

Various patents have been issued disclosing the use of a microcombustion based thermoelectric generator. In particular U.S. Pat. No. 6 951 456 to Adam L. Cohen et al. shows a design e.g. a variation of a Swiss roll type combustor where the reactant channel and exhaust channels are coiled around each other in a spiral configuration so that heat loss is reduced. Some T shaped or L shaped fins are included as parts of the thermoelectric active wall. Additionally some fins are extended in the reactant channel while others are extended in the exhaust channel. These fins were designed to act as a diffusion barrier between the n type and p type Terillium Te materials and to increase the thermal gradient. However in contrast to the embodiments described herein the above mentioned patent is based on homogeneous combustion.

Additionally published U.S. Patent Application 2007011146 discloses various catalytic converters to achieve complete combustion of liquid fuel using electrospray technologies with the cone jet mode to produce fuel droplets in uniform size. It is to be noted however that this previous patent investigated hydrocarbons and jet fuels as a source of fuel while the present invention among other things utilizes oxygenates as fuel instead of hydrocarbons. This patent application also employed a thin mesh support layer for the catalyst limiting the potential production rates when compared to the foam support layer of the present invention. Further the present invention demonstrates that a single reactor design is multi functional and can operate in multiple modes including reforming bio refinery and combustion mode as will be discussed in further detail below.

These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the following description while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.

The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein.

The embodiments described herein provide methods tests and devices that include a multifunctional compact converter based on catalytic combustion and electrospray technologies to convert liquid fuel to a variety of products. Compact is defined as cubic millimeter and cubic centimeter size scales. Multifunctional describes the capability of the compact converter to operate in three different modes complete combustion hydrogen production and olefin production. Complete combustion enables efficient production of heat for power generation applications. For example power generation through the use of PbTe thermoelectrics where maximum conversion efficiency occurs for temperatures close to 773K. The hydrogen production mode enables fuel reformation for hydrogen fuel power generation. Olefin production enables production of synthetic jet fuels.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

The reactor is made of a quartz ceramic material and is generally cylindrical in shape. It is to be appreciated however that the reactor may be designed having alternative shapes and sizes and as such the present invention is not limited thereto. Following from the direction of fuel injection device which for purposes of the embodiment described herein is the top of the converter a grounded mesh or screen is disposed below a droplet source not shown extending from and coupled to the electrostatic fuel injection device . Further grounded mesh is located at an approximate distance of 1 cm below the droplet source in order to have a large enough distance for the droplet to evaporate yet small enough distance to sustain the electrospray at a low voltage e.g. 3500 V for single nozzle electrospray without an extractor electrode . Thus the larger the distance between the droplet source and the grounded mesh the more voltage or power is needed. Nitrogen and oxygen gases i.e. air are introduced through gas intake and the effluent gas is released and sent to a gas chromatograph GC not shown through the bottom of the converter . It is to be appreciated that for purposes of example nitrogen and oxygen in air were utilized however the present invention is not limited thereto. For instance pure oxygen may also be utilized and introduced supplied through gas intake . Additionally liquid fuel may be introduced to reactor via fuel injection device . It is to be appreciated that the liquid fuel may include various types of fuel including but not limited to oxygenates having sufficient electrical conductivity for electro spray fuel injection or alcohols i.e. ethanol and butanols . Once introduced the fuel is flowed to the electrostatic fuel injection device and electrostatically atomized by creating a voltage difference between the droplet source and grounded mesh e.g. 3500 V for single nozzle electrospray without an extractor electrode . Preferably the fuel is electrosprayed using electrospraying techniques well known in the art such as for example cone jet mode in order to ultimately assist in obtaining an optimum droplet size e.g. 6 microns or flow rate of less than 4 milliliters per hour per nozzle. Further the fuel injection device is well suited for a compact combustor with required minimal power of approximately 0.35 mW per nozzle with an external pressure of less than 1 psig being provided by a liquid pump not shown attached thereto. It is to be appreciated that other well known electrospraying techniques may be employed such as for example multi jet mode or charge injection however the present invention is not limited thereto.

An inert blank foam mixer is located below grounded mesh to aid in the mixing of the fuel vapor and any incoming nitrogen and oxygen gases. Additionally grounded mesh is perpendicular to the direction of the droplet trajectory in order to create a uniform electric field between it and the fuel injection device . It is to be appreciated that to predict the evolution of the droplet size with time to determine the overall optimum droplet size for the desired application the Stephan Problem s differential mass balance was solved for a binary species in a spherically symmetric coordinate system with the radius being the only coordinate variable. Using the droplet mass conservation the change in droplet mass m with time is equal to the rate at which the liquid is vaporized 

The natural log term was rewritten from the form seen in Equation 5. Then by defining the right hand side of Equation 6 as a constant K the equation can be integrated with the appropriate boundary conditions and has the following solution 7 

Equation 7 also known as the d law shows that that setting a D value of zero and solving for t would represent the time it takes for the droplet to completely evaporate. Implicit in the derivation of the above model is that the ambient temperature does not exceed the boiling point of the droplet. This assumption eliminates the need to apply an energy balance to the liquid droplet or the gas envelope surrounding the droplet greatly simplifying the number of equations and unknowns in the process. Thus referring to sufficient heat e.g. a few degrees above the boiling point of the fuel is supplied via a heating element not shown located on the outside of the reactor creating a pre heat region near grounded mesh and a foam mixer to ensure complete evaporation or vaporization of the liquid fuel and to activate the catalyst in the reactor . During start up conditions the pre heating is achieved by an active heating element while during operation the heating element may be a passive heating element by heat reclamation processes. It is to be noted that any heating element well known in the art may be utilized such as a heating tape.

The catalyst material is a solid material that is placed between two inert porous alumina supports that act as heat shields and also serve as an additional mixing layer to ensure uniform fuel vapor concentration over the entire catalyst surface. Either a platinum metal mesh or a Rh AlOfoam can be used as the catalyst however it is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited thereto. For example other catalysts suitable for use may be foams such as active metals on gamma alumina or other oxide e.g. ceria support monolith with active metals active metals on oxide powder as well as any solid surface coated with a catalytic layer. For purposes of the present embodiment the platinum metal mesh had a weight of about 0.50 g and was roughly 0.5 mm thick. The Rh AlOfoam 5 mm thick contained 0.061 g of Rhodium Rh and was prepared in a manner detailed in Rhodium Supported on Thermally Enhanced Zeolite as Catalysts for Fuel Reformation of Jet Fuels Vol. 136 Catalysts Today p. 258 265 2008 by Ivan C. Lee which is incorporated herein by reference. The alumina monolith foam 80 pores per inch 17 mm diameter 5 mm thick was coated with alumina to roughen the foam surface and to increase the surface area. Then the foam was calcined in a box furnace at 973 K for 15 hours. An aqueous Rh NO solution was added to the foam and the resultant foam was calcined in the box furnace at approximately 973K for a subsequent 15 hours. The contact time between the catalyst fuel nitrogen and oxygen as well as the flow rate is dependent upon the thickness of the catalyst. That is the thicker the catalyst material or smaller the flowrate the greater the increase in contact time. Thus as expressed via a formula contact time thickness of the catalyst material flowrate.

Next a general explanation of the converted products will be provided in further detail according to experiments conducted with reference to the embodiment of . An air tight seal was placed around the converter and the gas chromatograph GC not shown . The amounts of hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane acetylene ethane ethylene propane propylene butane 1 butene cis 2 butene and trans 2 butene were monitored by an Agilent 4 channel micro GC not shown . Before each new iteration of fuel intake nitrogen was first passed through the reactor in order to clear out any lingering gases to ensure that no leaks existed and to ensure that no residual oxygen was present. Next the pre heat region near grounded mesh and catalyst was activated to provide heat to the catalyst as well as the region between the fuel injection device and grounded mesh . After the appropriate nitrogen and oxygen flow rates were introduced according to the contact time and equivalence ratio the grounded mesh and catalyst temperatures were allowed to equilibrate. A voltage differential between the grounded mesh and the tube not shown of the fuel injection device was established and as such the fuel flow was initiated. Voltages were then adjusted e.g. 3500 V for single nozzle electrospray without an extractor electrode to maintain electrospray stability in cone jet mode as observed visually. The grounded mesh and catalyst temperatures were again allowed to reach a steady state operating temperature e.g. ranging from 600 K to 873 K and the GC recorded the gas composition during this time. The overall contact time of the catalyst with the fuel nitrogen and oxygen ranged between 290 ms to 550 ms and further the back pressure of the reactor was less than 10 psig. The equivalence ratio was varied ranging from 0.18 3.2 thereby providing different products. For example in 1 butanol combustion for the equivalence ratio 95 and a yield 95 . Additionally under the same conditions hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields were minimal. It is to be noted that selectivity is defined herein as how many atoms are converted to some other product and yield is expressed as conversion selectivity which will be discussed in further detail below. Moreover for the equivalence ratio 0.75 but 99 and yield up to 12 .

When comparing ethanol and 1 butanol the oxygen flow rate and then the nitrogen flow rate was adjusted so that the total volumetric flow rate of gas remained the same at each equivalence ratio in . This step was performed to guarantee that the residence time inside the reactor was the same for both fuels thus eliminating other variables that could cloud the results such as for example fuel density and number of carbons in the molecular formula. Fuel flow rates of 1 mL hr were used for a single nozzle. The mean droplet diameter for ethanol at this flow rate was estimated to be 8.1 microns Phase Doppler Particle Analysis PDPA measurements.

For purposes of the embodiment described herein conversion was defined based on a carbon balance. In particular the carbon atoms in all of the products were summed and were then divided by the total amount of carbons in the fuel i.e. ethanol or 1 butanol fed into the reactor. This represents the percentage of carbon atoms that were converted into some compound or product other than the fuel.

Carbon selectivity was defined as the number of carbon atoms in a particular species divided by the total number of carbon atoms in the product gas as shown in the equation 8 below 

Similarly hydrogen selectivity was defined as the number of hydrogen atoms in a particular species divided by the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product gas. This represents the percentage of converted hydrogen atoms in each of the species studied and is shown in the equation 9 below 

The chemistry behind the catalyst surface reactions that result in production of the gases mentioned above have been studied extensively in the literature but in particular ethanol adsorption and subsequent decomposition on a rhodium surface was investigated. In particular it has been found that ethanol initially forms an ethoxy species on the surface of the catalyst before creating a bridged oxametallacycle. Subsequently it undergoes Carbon Carbon C C bond scission and is broken down into Hydrogen H Carbon C and Oxygen O atoms that then recombine to produce syngas hydrogen and carbon monoxide .

The carbon selectivities for ethanol combustion for carbon monoxide carbon dioxide paraffins and olefins with increasing equivalence ratios are shown in .

Referring to the graph shows that two distinct regimes exist for carbon selectivity. In particular at low equivalence ratios where 

The hydrogen selectivities for 1 butanol combustion are shown in . It is to be noted that the results appear similar to the hydrogen selectivity for ethanol combustion. The hydrogen selectivity for water vapor begins to decrease around the stoichiometric ratio and further decreases to a final value of approximately 70 . Hydrogen gas selectivity increased for equivalence ratio where 1 and then slightly decreased to final values roughly 15 and 10 respectively for ethanol and 1 butanol combustion. The main difference between ethanol and 1 butanol was the amount of olefins and paraffins produced as discussed above. Specifically ethanol combustion produced a hydrogen selectivity of nearly 20 for paraffins yet no olefins at a equivalence ration 3.17 whereas conversely 1 butanol combustion produced a hydrogen selectivity of slightly less than 20 for olefins and about 3 for paraffins.

The carbon selectivity for 1 butanol combustion using as a function of the equivalence ratio for Rh AlOis shown in in an analogous manner to . shows the carbon selectivity for 1 butanol combustion and the trend is very similar to that of ethanol shown in . As shown COhas a nearly 100 carbon selectivity until the stoichiometric fuel to air ratio is approached. After that the COselectivity rapidly decreases to a final value of less than 40 . A comparison of shows that the carbon selectivity for COdecreases much further for 1 butanol than for ethanol combustion and this corresponds to larger amounts of other products being formed.

Referring to shown is a comparison of the hydrogen selectivities for ethanol and 1 butanol as a function of the equivalence ratio for the Rh AlOfoam catalyst. Shown is that ethanol combustion produces a higher hydrogen selectivity for Hgas at all equivalence ratios. Thus for the range of equivalence ratios disclosed with reference to the graph and embodiments herein ethanol is better suited for fuel reformation than 1 butanol. Moreover having an equivalence ratio of 1.5 produces the highest hydrogen selectivity for both ethanol and 1 butanol. Consequently it is to be noted that this would be an ideal equivalence ratio at which to operate if Hproduction for fuel cells is required.

It is to be noted that about 60 of the total carbons for 1 butanol combustion as compared to only about 45 of the total carbons in ethanol combustion are found in a compound or product other than COat an equivalence ratio 3.2. Approximately 25 and 45 of the carbons for ethanol and 1 butanol combustion respectively are in the form of paraffins and olefins as shown in . Additionally the comparison demonstrates that olefins e.g. 14.5 propylene 15.5 1 butene 6.0 trans 2 butene and 6.5 cis 2 butene are produced for 1 butanol combustion in significant amounts whereas only trace amounts of olefins e.g. 0.57 ethylene were produced for ethanol combustion. The converse is true of paraffins. That is more paraffins are found for ethanol than are found for 1 butanol combustion. The carbon selectivities are 22.9 methane in ethanol combustion and only 3.1 propane in 1 butanol combustion. It is to be noted that this conversion of fuel into paraffins and olefins has promise for use in other bio refinery technologies known in the art.
