title: Flare adapter and conversion kit for shotgun
abstract: A pen flare may be adapted for firing from a weapon having a caliber larger than a caliber of the pen flare. The adapted flare may be fired from a conventional shotgun. The adapted flare may include a pen flare with a portion having external threads and a base. The base may include an extractor rim and a through-bore with internal threads. The pen flare may be fixed in the through-bore of the base via the external and internal threads. A rear portion of the base may have an outer diameter that is greater than an outer diameter of a front portion of the base. A cylindrical sleeve may be disposed around the front portion of the base and around the pen flare. A conventional shotgun may be reversibly converted to a compact, lighter weight shotgun with a kit. The converted shotgun may be more desirable for firing flares.

Since early in Operation Enduring Freedom OEF and Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF there has been a need for non lethal warnings to be used as part of escalation of force EOF . Individuals and or vehicles may approach a foot patrol vehicle convoy or a checkpoint CP in a potentially hostile manner. A traditional solution has been to fire non lethal flares at the individuals or the vehicles. The non lethal flares may assist in determining the intent of an individual or motorist before deadly force is employed.

The flare launchers currently in use may be single shot and may not have a safety mechanism. The known flare launchers may be slow to reload particularly if multiple shots are needed. Existing flare launchers may accidentally discharge if dropped. Accidental discharge is a concern for soldiers who desire to carry a loaded launcher. A need exists for an apparatus and method for firing multiple non lethal warnings to potentially hostile approaching individuals and or vehicles.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for firing multiple non lethal warnings to potentially hostile approaching individuals and or vehicles.

One aspect of the invention may be a method. The method may include adapting a pen flare for firing from a weapon having a caliber larger than the caliber of the pen flare. The pen flare may include external threads. Adapting the pen flare may include providing a base having a through bore with internal threads and threading the pen flare into the base.

Another aspect of the invention may be a kit for adapting a pen flare with external threads for firing from a weapon of a certain caliber. The kit may include a base and a cylindrical sleeve. The base may have an extractor rim and a through bore with internal threads for mating with the external threads of the pen flare. A rear portion of the base located forward of the extractor rim may have an outer diameter that is greater than an outer diameter of a front portion of the base. The cylindrical sleeve may be disposed around the front portion of the base and around the pen flare.

In another aspect the invention may include a flare for firing from a weapon of a certain caliber. The flare may include a pen flare a base and a cylindrical sleeve. The pen flare may include a portion having external threads. The base may include an extractor rim and a through bore with internal threads. The pen flare may be fixed in the through bore of the base via the external and internal threads. The cylindrical sleeve may be disposed around a front portion of the base and around the pen flare.

A further aspect of the invention may include a kit for converting a conventional shotgun to a compact shotgun. The kit may include a conversion barrel having a shorter length than a barrel of the conventional shotgun a conversion magazine spring having a shorter length than a magazine spring of the conventional shotgun a conversion magazine tube having a shorter length than a magazine tube of the conventional shotgun and a conversion pump action slide.

The conversion pump action slide may include actions bars a tube and a grip. The tube and the grip may each have a shorter length than the tube and the grip of the pump action slide of the conventional shotgun. The kit may also include a pistol grip.

Another method of the invention may include providing a conventional full length pump action shotgun and converting it to a compact pump action shotgun. The method may include after converting the shotgun reverting the compact shotgun to the conventional full length pump action shotgun.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A projecting portion and B may be disposed on the outer circumference of front portion . Projecting portion may help secure sleeve on front portion of base . The inside diameter G of sleeve may be about the same as the outside diameter I of pen flare . Projecting portion may have a larger outside diameter than the inside diameter G of sleeve .

The external dimensions of flare may be substantially the same as the external dimensions of conventional shotgun cartridge . External dimensions of flare may be varied so that flare may be suitable for firing from various gauge shotguns for example 10 gauge 12 gauge 16 gauge 20 gauge etc. An overall length H of flare may be about the same as overall length A of cartridge . Extractor rims of cartridge and flare respectively may have substantially the same outside diameters. Outside diameter B of cartridge may be substantially the same as outside diameter D of flare .

Pen flare may be positioned in flare so that the firing mechanism of shotgun may actuate primer of pen flare . Because flare may have substantially the same external dimensions as cartridge shotgun may be able to feed chamber extract and eject flare in the same manner as cartridge .

A plurality of flares may be used in shotgun to fire multiple rounds of warning ammunition during escalation of force. An advantage of conventional shotgun is that the user is already familiar with its operation. Furthermore shotgun allows multiple shots to be fired rapidly and safely. In addition shotgun may have a manual safety. Flares in conjunction with conventional shotgun may be a much needed tool for a soldier manning a checkpoint or a soldier in a vehicle turret. Those soldiers may need to fire multiple non lethal warnings to approaching vehicles or individuals.

Flares and conventional shotgun provide a soldier with the capability of rapidly delivering multiple non lethal warning shots from a shotgun with a mechanical safety during EOF scenarios. Flares may be loaded into and unloaded from shotgun multiple times.

A kit for adapting pen flare for firing from shotgun may include base and sleeve . Base and sleeve may be reused multiple times for example as many as eight times. After flare is fired and ejected from shotgun sleeve may be removed from base . The spent pen flare may be removed from base and a fresh pen flare inserted in base . Sleeve may then be reattached to base to create a fresh flare .

Flare and a kit or adapter that may include base and sleeve have been described in connection with shotgun . However the method and apparatus of the invention may be used with or for a weapon of any caliber whether a shotgun rifle or handgun. In all cases the caliber of the weapon may be larger than the caliber of pen flare .

To realize the advantages of a small lightweight compact weapon for firing multiple rounds of warning ammunition and or flares conventional shotgun may be converted to a smaller lighter more compact shotgun . The overall size and weight of converted shotgun may be much less than conventional full size shotgun . The smaller and lighter weight converted shotgun may be a useful tool for a soldier manning a checkpoint or a soldier in a vehicle turret who needs to fire multiple non lethal warnings to approaching vehicles.

It may be possible to utilize converted compact shotgun in other roles such as firing door breaching ammunition or lethal ammunition. The compactness and ease of maneuverability of converted shotgun may lend itself to a door breaching tool or an accessory shotgun to mount under a host rifle.

A conversion kit may contain the parts needed to convert shotgun into shotgun . As an example conventional full length pump action shotgun may be a standard issue 12 gauge shotgun such as a Mossberg model M500 or M590. Shotgun may be converted into compact 4 shot hand held device . Shotgun may not be permanently changed. Shotgun may be reverted to its pre conversion configuration. A minimum of tools for example a punch and an Allen wrench may be needed to revert converted shotgun to its pre conversion configuration. The reversion process may include reinstalling the original conventional parts.

Pump action slide of shotgun may include action bars like those of shotgun . Action tube and action grip of shotgun may be shorter than action tube and action grip of shotgun . The shoulder stock of shotgun may be replaced with a pistol grip . The shorter length of shotgun may reduce its size and weight compared to shotgun . Thus shotgun may be more compact and easily handled.

A kit may include barrel magazine tube magazine spring pump action slide and pistol grip . The kit may be used to convert shotgun into shotgun . Once converted the parts removed from shotgun may be retained for future use. That is shotgun may be reverted to shotgun by removing barrel magazine tube magazine spring pump action slide and pistol grip and then installing barrel magazine spring magazine tube pump action slide and shoulder stock . The kit may avoid the need to purchase two complete weapons. It may be easier to purchase stock and supply components rather than complete weapons.

Users of the kit may be for example military organizations law enforcement organizations or other organizations. The organizations may already have shotguns in inventory. For example a military unit may be deployed with shotguns . The military unit may find themselves in a situation where temporarily shorter shotguns may be beneficial. Then when there is no longer a need for shorter shotguns shotgun may be reverted to shotguns .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
