Some known enterprise software packages include numerous features that are intended to meet the needs of a variety of users. In some computer systems these known enterprise software packages may include at least some features and or upgrades to these features that can needlessly consume computing resources and or that are dispersed throughout portions of the enterprise software packages. In some instances the features that are available within the enterprise software package may not even meet the specific needs of a user of the computer system. In addition the features of the enterprise software package may cause inconveniences during initial installation and or upgrading of the enterprise software package that may not be desirable to some users. Thus a need exists for systems methods and apparatus to address the shortfalls of present technology and to provide other new and innovative features.

In one general aspect a computer system can include instructions stored on a non transitory computer readable storage medium. The computer system can include an enterprise process selection module configured to receive a plurality of enterprise process definitions representing a plurality of existing enterprise processes implemented on a target system. The computer system can include a proposed solution package manager configured to select based on the plurality of enterprise process definitions a proposed solution package including a new enterprise process and configured to define an indicator of a mandatory operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a first existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes and an indicator of an optional operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes. The computer system can include a solution package generator configured to receive an indicator that the optional operational relationship has been selected for binding to the second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes and configured to define based on the indicator of the optional operational relationship selection an implementation of the new enterprise process in an integrated solution package.

In another general aspect a non transitory computer readable storage medium can store code representing instructions that when executed are configured to cause a processor to perform a process. The code can include code to receive a plurality of enterprise process definitions representing a plurality of existing enterprise processes implemented on a target system and select based on the plurality of enterprise process definitions a proposed solution package including a new enterprise process. The code can also include code to define an indicator of a mandatory operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a first existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes and an indicator of an optional operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes. The code can include code to receive an indicator that the optional operational relationship has been selected for binding to the second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes.

In yet another general aspect a method can include executing instructions recorded on a non transitory computer readable storage media using at least one processor. The method can include receiving a plurality of enterprise process definitions representing a plurality of existing enterprise processes implemented on a target system and selecting based on the plurality of enterprise process definitions a proposed solution package including a new enterprise process. The method can include defining an indicator of a mandatory operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a first existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes and an indicator of an optional operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes. The method can also include receiving an indicator that the n optional operational relationship has been selected for binding to the second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise process and defining based on the indicator of the optional operational relationship selection an implementation of the new enterprise process in an integrated solution package.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

For example the process module can be configured to define a solution package that includes an implementation of a new enterprise process that operate with e.g. can be accessed by can be triggered by existing enterprise process Q and operate with existing enterprise process Q. Accordingly separate instances of the new enterprise process do not need to be included in each of existing enterprise process Q and existing enterprise process Q. Instead the functionality of the new enterprise process is consolidated in the solution package. This type of solution package can be referred to as an integrated solution package. Because each of these existing enterprise processes Q and Q trigger functionality associated with a common new enterprise process that is integrated into an integrated solution package these existing enterprise processes can be referred to as integrated existing enterprise processes. In other words portions new enterprise processes that can operate with the existing enterprise processes have been integrated into the integrated solution package. In some embodiments the new enterprise process or a portion thereof can be triggered by for example a process step e.g. instances of a triggering process step included in the existing enterprise processes Q and Q.

Although not shown in each of the existing enterprise processes can be associated with an enterprise process definition. An enterprise process definition can include information associated with one or more functions of an existing enterprise process. For example an enterprise process definition associated with existing enterprise process Q can include enterprise process values representing the process steps defining the existing enterprise process Q the functions of the process steps of the existing enterprise process Q interfaces with one or more portions of the existing enterprise process Q the version of the existing enterprise process Q the relationship of the existing enterprise process Q with other existing enterprise processes from the existing enterprise processes data that can be processed within the existing enterprise process Q and or a portion thereof and or so forth.

As discussed herein an integrated solution package associated with an existing enterprise process can be any type of hardware and or software combination that can be used to integrate the existing enterprise processes at the computer system . In other words the integrated solution package can be an implementation of or can be used to implement an integrated solution package associated with the existing enterprise processes at the computer system . For example the integrated solution package can be an executable software module that can be installed on the computer system .

As shown in the enterprise process integration module includes an enterprise process selection module . The enterprise process selection module is configured to select one or more of the existing enterprise processes that are eligible for integration. An existing enterprise process can be referred to as being eligible for integration when at least a portion of the existing enterprise process can be associated with e.g. trigger at least a portion of an integrated solution package.

The enterprise process selection module can be configured to determine whether or not one or more portions e.g. process steps of the existing enterprise processes can be configured to trigger a new enterprise process integrated into an integrated solution package based on one or more eligibility conditions not shown . An eligibility condition is any type of condition that can be used to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing enterprise processes for integration. An eligibility condition can be used to enforce one or more eligibility prerequisites that can be for example defined by a user e.g. an administrator . Thus an eligibility condition can be defined based on one or more eligibility prerequisites.

For example an eligibility condition may be satisfied for a particular existing enterprise process from the existing enterprise processes when the existing enterprise process can be configured to interface with e.g. send data to received data from an integrated solution package. As a specific example existing enterprise process Q may be eligible for integration because existing enterprise process Q can be interfaced with e.g. can trigger functionality of an integrated solution package while existing enterprise process Q may not be eligible for integration because existing enterprise process Q cannot be interfaced with e.g. cannot trigger functionality of an integrated solution package. In some embodiments an eligibility condition may be satisfied for a particular existing enterprise process from the existing enterprise processes when the existing enterprise process can be configured to trigger functionality associated with a new enterprise process that can be integrated into an integrated solution package. In some embodiments one or more eligibility conditions can be stored in e.g. stored in an eligibility condition database and or accessed from a memory . These example eligibility conditions are presented by way of example only and are not inclusive of all of the types of eligibility conditions that can be used to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing enterprise processes for integration.

In some embodiments the enterprise process selection module can be configured to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing enterprise processes for integration based on an enterprise process definition associated with one or more of the existing enterprise processes satisfying one or more eligibility conditions. For example the enterprise process selection module can be configured to determine that at least a portion of existing enterprise process Q is eligible for integration into an integrated solution package based on a portion of an enterprise process definition of existing enterprise process Q that satisfies an eligibility condition.

The enterprise process integration module also includes a proposed solution package manager . The proposed solution package manager is configured to select or define one or more proposed solution packages stored in the memory for the existing enterprise processes . Each of the proposed solution packages can represent a potential integrated solution package that can be used to integrate one or more of the existing enterprise processes . A proposed solution package that represents a potential integrated solution package for integration of an existing enterprise process can be referred to as a proposed solution package for the existing enterprise process or can be referred to as a proposed solution package for integration of the existing enterprise process.

The proposed solution packages can include or can be associated with various selectable integration features also can be referred to as proposed integration features that can be used to define an integrated solution package for one or more of the existing enterprise processes . In other words the proposed solution packages can each be or can include a definition e.g. a map a set of parameter values a database of possible integration features that can be included in an integrated solution package. In some embodiments one or more of the proposed solution packages can be visually represented. In some embodiments one or more of the selectable integration features can be selected by a user such as user and the selected integration features can be included in the integrated solution package for one or more existing enterprise processes . Accordingly the proposed solution packages can each function as a tool that can be used e.g. used by a user to define an integrated solution package for one or more the existing enterprise processes . Said differently the proposed solution packages can be used to define integrated solution packages that are actually installed on the computer system .

The proposed solution package manager can be configured to determine whether or not one or more of the proposed solution packages represents a potential integrated solution package for one or more of the existing enterprise processes based on one or more solution package conditions not shown . A solution package condition is any type of condition that can be used to select a proposed solution package for an existing enterprise process. A solution package condition can be used to enforce one or more prerequisites for a solution package to be proposed for integration of an existing enterprise process. Thus a solution package condition can be defined based on one or more solution package prerequisites which can be defined by a user such as an administrator .

For example a solution package condition may be satisfied for a particular proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages when the proposed solution package can interface with at least one of the existing enterprise processes or subset that is eligible for integration . As a specific example a proposed solution package can be selected by the proposed solution package manager for existing enterprise process Q when the proposed solution package includes a new enterprise process e.g. a proposed new enterprise process that can interface with the existing enterprise process Q and is eligible for integration .

In some embodiments one or more solution package conditions may satisfied if one or more of existing enterprise processes and or the proposed solution packages are modified. For example a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages may be associated with a first program version e.g. program version 3.0 and the existing enterprise processes may be associated with a second program version e.g. program version 1.0 . The proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages may be selected by the propose solution package manager if the existing enterprise processes are modified e.g. upgraded to a program version that is compatible with the first program version. These example solution package conditions are presented by way of example only and are not inclusive of all of the types of solution package conditions that can be used to select proposed solution packages for the existing enterprise processes .

In some embodiments the proposed solution package manager can be configured to select one or more of the proposed solution packages for at least a subset of the existing enterprise processes based on at least a portion of an enterprise process definition associated with the existing enterprise processes satisfying one or more solution package conditions. For example the proposed solution package manager can be configured to select a proposed solution package from proposed solution packages for integration of existing enterprise process Q based on a portion of an enterprise process definition of existing enterprise process Q that satisfies a solution package condition.

In some embodiments multiple solution packages from the proposed solution packages can be selected for one or more of the existing enterprise processes by the proposed solution package manager . The proposed solution package manager can be configured to receive an indicator that only a portion of the multiple solution packages are to be used as a tool to define an integrated solution package. In such embodiments an indicator that only a portion of the multiple solution packages are to be used can be triggered e.g. triggered via selection by the user .

In some embodiments the proposed solution package manager can be configured to select a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages only if the proposed solution package can be used to integrate more than one of the existing enterprise processes . For example the proposed solution package manager can be configured to select a first proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages for triggering of a new enterprise process common to both existing enterprise process Q and existing enterprise process Q. A second proposed solution package may not be selected from the proposed solution packages because the second proposed solution package is related to a new enterprise process associated with only one existing enterprise process from the existing enterprise processes .

In some embodiments prerequisites that may satisfy one or more solution package conditions and or eligibility conditions be presented to the user . These prerequisites may be presented to the user so that the user can optionally make modifications to satisfy one or more of the solution package conditions and or one or more of eligibility conditions. For example the enterprise process integration module e.g. via a user interface module of the enterprise process integration module can be configured to notify the user that a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages may be used to integrate one or more of the existing enterprise processes if the one or more existing enterprise processes is modified e.g. upgraded to a specified program version . Accordingly one or more of the existing enterprise processes can be modified e.g. upgraded to at least the specified program version to be compatible with an integrated solution package defined based on a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages . In some embodiments one or more solution package conditions and or eligibility conditions may be over ridden e.g. manually disabled ignored by the user .

As shown in the enterprise process integration module includes a solution package generator configured to define an integrated solution package based on one or more proposed solution packages . The solution package generator can be configured to define the integrated solution package based on one or more of the selectable integration features of a proposed solution package being selected. In some embodiments the selectable integration features of the proposed solution package for an existing enterprise process e.g. existing enterprise process Q from the existing enterprise processes can be selected by a user such as user .

In some embodiments an integrated solution package can be or can include one or more databases any type of executable software module such as a computer program based on but not limited to micro code or micro instructions machine instructions such as produced by a compiler code used to produce a web service and files containing higher level instructions that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example or more portions of a solution package may be implemented using Java C or other programming languages e.g. object oriented programming languages and development tools. In some embodiments an integrated solution package for one or more existing enterprise processes can define at least a portion of one or more applications or can be associated with one or more applications of the computer system . In some embodiments an integrated solution package can be or can include a user interface component associated with one or more existing enterprise processes and the user interface component can be configured for display e.g. rendering . In some embodiments one or more integrated solution packages can have or can be a background process with functionality that is not visible i.e. not displayed .

In some embodiments a portion of a proposed solution package can have one or more proposed operational relationships which can be proposed integration features with one or more existing enterprise processes. For example an operational relationship between a new enterprise process included in a proposed solution package and an existing enterprise process can be classified as a mandatory operational relationship based on an enterprise process definition associated with the existing enterprise process. Accordingly if an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package the integrated solution package must include the operational relationship between the new enterprise process included in the integrated solution package and the existing enterprise process. In other words the existing enterprise process must be configured to operate with the new enterprise process included in the integrated solution package based on the mandatory operational relationship.

In some embodiments an operational relationship between a new enterprise process included in a proposed solution package and an existing enterprise process can be classified as an optional operational relationship based on an enterprise process definition associated with the existing enterprise process. Accordingly if an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package the integrated solution package could if selected as an integration feature to include in the integrated solution package include the operational relationship between the new enterprise process included in the integrated solution package and the existing enterprise process. In other words the existing enterprise process could be configured to operate with the new enterprise process included in the integrated solution package based on the optional operational relationship. More details related to mandatory operational relationships and optional operational relationships are described in connection with for example .

In some embodiments the integrated solution package can include configuration data associated with a configuration file defining at least a portion of the existing enterprise process and or new enterprise process or portion thereof for which the integrated solution package is defined. Configuration data can be included in a database repository and can be configured to define one or more functions of one or more new enterprise processes associated with one or more existing enterprise processes.

The enterprise process integration module includes a user interface module configured to define one or more user interfaces not shown in that can be presented to a user . The user interfaces can be presented to the user via a display of the computer system . The user interface module can be configured to manage e.g. send manipulate trigger execution of user interfaces through which users such as user can access e.g. use trigger the functionality of the process module e.g. the functionality of the enterprise process integration module . For example prerequisites related to compatibility of one or more of the proposed solution packages with one or more of the existing enterprise processes can be presented to the user via a user interface of the user interface module . As another example selectable integration features e.g. proposed integration features related to proposed solution packages can be can be presented to the user via a user interface of the user interface module .

In some embodiments one or more of the user interfaces can be for example a browser based user interface that includes various buttons links controls services and or so forth that can be used by a user such as user to access the functionality of the process module . The user interface s can be rendered within the display for the user so that the user can access one or more functions of the process module . For example the user can using the computer system access a user interface served by the user interface module to a browser application of the computer system . The user can then use the user interface to trigger one or more functions associated with the computer system .

As shown in the functionality of the process module can be accessed e.g. can be triggered via the computer system on which the existing enterprise processes are installed. Specifically the functionality of the process module is accessed via the computer system and the display of the computer system . In some embodiments the functionality of the process module can be accessed e.g. can be triggered by the user via a terminal device associated with the computer system .

Although not shown in some embodiments the process module or portions thereof can be configured to operate within for example a data center e.g. a cloud computing environment a computer system one or more server host devices and or so forth. In some embodiments the functionality of the process module can be distributed to several devices.

In some embodiments one or more portions of the components shown in the process module in can be or can include a hardware based module e.g. a digital signal processor DSP a field programmable gate array FPGA a memory a firmware module and or a software based module e.g. a module of computer code a set of computer readable instructions that can be executed at a computer . For example in some embodiments one or more portions of the enterprise process integration module can be or can include a software module configured for execution by at least one processor not shown . The processor can be configured to execute one or more instructions and can include one or more co processors and or memory portions. In some embodiments the functionality of the components can be included in different modules and or components than those shown in . For example although not shown the functionality of the enterprise process integration module can be included in a different module than the enterprise process integration module or divided into several different modules.

Although not shown in some embodiments the memory can be implemented as more than one memory component e.g. more than one random access memory RAM component or disk drive memory within the process module . In some embodiments the memory can be a database memory. In some embodiments the memory can be or can include a non local memory e.g. a memory not physically included within the process module . For example the memory can be or can include a memory shared by multiple devices not shown . In some embodiments the memory can be associated with a server device not shown within a network and configured to serve the process module .

In some embodiments the process module or portions thereof and or the computer system or portions thereof can be configured to operate within a network. In other words the process module or portions thereof and or the computer system or portions thereof can be configured to function within various types of network environments that can include one or more client devices and or one or more server devices. For example the network can be or can include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN and or so forth. The network can be or can include a wireless network and or wireless network implemented using for example gateway devices bridges switches and or so forth. The network can include one or more segments and or can have portions based on various protocols such as Internet Protocol IP and or a proprietary protocol. The network can include at least a portion of the Internet.

The computer system can be for example a wired device and or a wireless device e.g. wi fi enabled device and can be for example a computing entity e.g. a personal computing device a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a server device e.g. a web server a host device and or so forth. The computer system can be configured to operate based on one or more platforms e.g. one or more similar or different platforms that can include one or more types of hardware software firmware operating systems runtime libraries and or so forth. In some embodiments computer system can represent a cluster of devices e.g. a server farm .

In some embodiments the enterprise process integration module e.g. the solution package generator of the enterprise process integration module can be configured to define an integrated solution package associated with any portion of an existing enterprise process. For example the enterprise process integration module can be configured to define an integrated solution package related to individual functions e.g. process steps or portions thereof of a new enterprise process for an existing enterprise process. As a specific example the enterprise process integration module can be configured to define an integrated solution package that includes a function e.g. a process step or portions thereof that can be triggered by both existing enterprise process Q and existing enterprise process Q e.g. triggered by instances of a triggering process step included in both existing enterprise process Q and existing enterprise process Q . The eligibility of the existing enterprise processes Q and Q for integration can be determined based on one or more eligibility conditions and or one or more enterprise process definitions associated with the function triggered by existing enterprise processes Q and Q. A proposed solution package can be selected from the proposed solution packages based on one or more solution package conditions and or one or more enterprise process definitions associated with the function that can be triggered by existing enterprise processes Q and Q.

In some embodiments the enterprise process integration module e.g. the solution package generator of the enterprise process integration module can be configured to define an integrated solution package for a variant of an existing enterprise process. A variant of an existing enterprise process can be a customized version of the existing enterprise process. For example existing enterprise process Q and existing enterprise process Q can each be different variants of the same existing enterprise process. Existing enterprise process Q may include triggering capabilities that do not exist in enterprise process Q and vice versa. As a specific example existing enterprise process Q can include one or more process steps or portions thereof that can be configured to trigger a new enterprise process that are not also included in existing enterprise process Q and vice versa.

A variant of an existing enterprise process can include a combination of process steps and or functions of the process steps selected for inclusion in an existing enterprise process. For example a set of process steps that are available for optional selection can be selected for inclusion in an existing enterprise process. Certain functions that are available for optional selection can be associated with e.g. define at least a portion of a subset of the process steps from the set of process steps. The combination of the set of process steps and the functions associated with the subset of process steps can collectively define a variant of the existing enterprise process. Process steps that are selected for inclusion in an existing enterprise process can be referred to as being bound to the existing enterprise process and or bound to process steps required as part of the existing enterprise process. Functions that are selected for inclusion in an existing enterprise process in conjunction with a process step can be referred to as being bound to the process step. In some embodiments at least some of the process steps of a variant of an existing enterprise process can be configured to trigger a new enterprise process that can be included in an integrated solution package.

In some embodiments one or more of the existing enterprise processes can include mandatory process steps that define the core functionality of the existing enterprise process es . An existing enterprise process that includes only mandatory process steps can be referred to as a standard version of the existing enterprise process. Optional process steps when added to e.g. appended to the core functionality of the standard version of the existing enterprise process can define a variant or customized version of the existing enterprise process. Also optional functionality of the process steps of an existing enterprise process can define variants of the existing enterprise process.

In some embodiments the proposed solution package manager can be configured to select a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages only for mandatory portions of the existing enterprise processes . In other words the proposed solution package manager may not select a proposed solution package from the proposed solution packages if the proposed solution package is related only to e.g. can only be triggered from optional portions of one or more of the existing enterprise processes .

In some embodiments the enterprise process selection module may determine that one or more existing enterprise processes may be ineligible for integration because the existing enterprise process es is an ineligible variant of an existing enterprise process. For example one or more of the existing enterprise processes may be classified by the enterprise process selection module as being ineligible for integration because the existing enterprise process es includes an optional process step or mandatory process step that prevents the existing enterprise process es from being associated with an integration solution package. An example of an existing enterprise process with optional new enterprise processes that can be used to define variants of the existing enterprise process is shown in .

A flow of information between the process steps of existing enterprise process B is represented by arrows. For example optional process step B is related to mandatory process step B based on a function associated with the optional process step B being configured to process information e.g. data produced by a function of the mandatory process step B. Similarly optional process step B is related to mandatory process step B based on a function associated with the optional process step B being configured to send information e.g. data to a function of the mandatory process step B.

Each of the process steps from the existing enterprise process B can be referred to by their classification as a mandatory process step or as an optional process step which are types of process steps . For example process step B which is an optional process step and can be referred to as optional process step B.

In this embodiment the mandatory process steps are represented by rectangles with solid lines. In other words representations of the mandatory process steps include rectangles with solid lines. Also the optional process steps are represented by rectangles with dashed lines. In other words representations of the optional process steps include rectangles with dashed lines.

Various combinations of the optional process steps can be combined with e.g. bound to the mandatory process steps to define variants of the existing enterprise process B. For example process step B can be combined with the mandatory process steps to define a first variant of the existing enterprise process B and process steps B and B can be combined with the mandatory process steps to define a second variant of the existing enterprise process. A variant of the existing enterprise process B that includes only the mandatory process steps can be referred to as standard enterprise process B. These variants of the existing enterprise process B are not shown in .

In some embodiments the optional process steps can be dependent from the mandatory process steps but not dependent from other optional process steps . For example in some embodiments a variant of the existing enterprise process B must include all of the mandatory process steps but can include only a subset of the optional process steps . In other words a variant of the existing enterprise process B can include all of the mandatory process steps and only for example process step B. This variant of the existing enterprise process be can be operational without the preceding optional process steps process step B and process step B.

The process steps shown in existing enterprise process B can represent process steps within an existing enterprise process. For example the process steps of the existing enterprise process B can be representations of the process steps of a sales order processing enterprise process. Accordingly mandatory process step B can represent a main process step related to creation updating rejecting a sales order etc. and mandatory process step B can represent a process step related to an availability to purchase promise check and or update. Optional process step B can represent an optional credit check process step optional process step B can represent an optional advertising campaign determination step and optional process step B can represent an optional managerial accounting auditing process step. Mandatory process step B can represent a mandatory purchase order request process step and mandatory process step B can represent a mandatory delivery creation process step.

In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in existing enterprise B can be configured to function as a background process that is not visible. In other words the process step may neither require an input value from a user nor produce a result that may be visible to a user via for example a user interface. In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in existing enterprise B may require user input in order for the process step to be executed. For example a process step from existing enterprise process B may require an input value from a user so that one or more functions of the process step can be performed. In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in existing enterprise process B can be configured to produce a result that may be visible to a user via for example a user interface. For example a process step from the existing enterprise process B can be a process step that can produce a result that can be presented to a user via a user interface e.g. a notification via the user interface . As a specific example if the process step is a process step related to a credit check the result may be a credit score associated with a user of the existing enterprise process B. Although not shown in a new enterprise process can be or can include one or more process steps similar to those included in existing enterprise process B.

As shown in a plurality of enterprise process definitions representing a plurality of existing enterprise processes implemented on a target system are received block . In some embodiments the plurality of enterprise process definitions can be stored in a database associated with the computer system where the plurality of existing enterprise processes are implemented. In some embodiments at least a portion of the plurality of enterprise process definitions can be defined based on an analysis of the plurality of existing enterprise processes implemented at the computer system. In some embodiments at least a portion of the plurality of existing enterprise processes can be selected based on an eligibility condition being satisfied.

Based on the plurality of enterprise process definitions a proposed solution package including a new enterprise process is selected block . The proposed solution package can be selected from a set of proposed solution packages such as proposed solution package is shown in . In some embodiments the new enterprise process can be referred to as a proposed new enterprise process. In some embodiments the proposed solution package can be based on a portion of a new enterprise process e.g. a function of a new enterprise process . In some embodiments the proposed solution package can be selected based on a solution package condition being satisfied.

An indicator of a mandatory operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a first existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes and an indicator of an optional operational relationship between the new enterprise process and a second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise processes are defined block . In some embodiments the new enterprise process can be a new enterprise process that can be triggered by each of the first existing enterprise process and the second existing enterprise process. In some embodiments the operational relationship between the new enterprise process and the first existing enterprise process can be classified as a mandatory operational relationship based on an enterprise process definition associated with the first existing enterprise process. In some embodiments the operational relationship between the new enterprise process and the second existing enterprise process can be classified as an optional operational relationship based on an enterprise process definition associated with the second existing enterprise process. In some embodiments one or more of the indicators can be defined by a proposed solution package manager such as proposed solution package manager shown in .

An indicator that the optional operational relationship has been selected for binding to the second existing enterprise process from the plurality of existing enterprise process is received block . In some embodiments the optional operational relationship can be selected for binding to the second existing enterprise process by for example a user. In some embodiments the indicator can be received at a solution package generator such as solution package generator shown in .

Based on the indicator of the optional operational relationship selection an implementation of the new enterprise process in an integrated solution package is defined block . In some embodiments the integrated solution package can be an executable software solution package that can be installed on a computer system. In some embodiments the integrated solution package can be defined by a solution package generator such as solution package generator shown in .

In some embodiments the existing enterprise processes can be any type of enterprise process. For example the existing enterprise process G can be a quotation enterprise process the existing enterprise process G can be a sales order from stock enterprise process and the existing enterprise process G can be an outbound delivery enterprise process.

As shown in proposed new enterprise process E of the proposed solution package H can be triggered by the existing enterprise process G as represented by arrow M . In this embodiment because the proposed new enterprise process E of the proposed solution package H can operate with e.g. can be triggered by can trigger can be accessed by one or more process steps of the existing enterprise processes the proposed solution package H may be selected for integration of at least existing enterprise process G. In other words the proposed solution package H may be selected as a potential integrated solution package for integration of the existing enterprise processes .

In some alternative embodiments because the proposed new enterprise process E of the proposed solution package H can operate with e.g. can be triggered by one or more process steps of only one of the existing enterprise processes the proposed solution package H may not be selected for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes . In other words the proposed solution package H may not be selected as a potential integrated solution package for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes .

As shown in proposed new enterprise processes E and E of the proposed solution package H can operate with e.g. can be connected with can be triggered by one or more process steps of the new enterprise processes E and E as respectively represented by arrow N and O . Also as illustrated by arrow P proposed new enterprise process E of the proposed solution package H can operate with e.g. can be triggered by can trigger one or more process steps of the existing enterprise process G. The operational relationship of proposed new enterprise process E with existing enterprise process G can be considered an upgrade to existing enterprise process G because proposed new enterprise process E currently does not operate with existing enterprise process G. Similarly proposed new enterprise processes E and E can be considered an upgrade to existing enterprise process G.

In some embodiments the new enterprise processes can be any type of enterprise process. For example the new enterprise process E can be a credit check enterprise process and the new enterprise process E can be a credit update enterprise process.

Although not shown in the proposed new enterprise processes e.g. new enterprise process E new enterprise process E can be triggered as an upgrade by any of the process steps already included in existing enterprise processes e.g. enterprise process G . For example new enterprise process E can be triggered by at least a portion of process step G G and or G of existing enterprise process G. In other words one or more of the process steps included in the existing enterprise processes can function as an interface with the new enterprise processes. In some embodiments a process step configured to trigger functionality of a new enterprise process can be referred to as a triggering process step.

In this embodiment because the proposed solution package H includes at least one new enterprise process proposed new enterprise process E that can be associated with existing enterprise processes G and G the proposed solution package H may be selected for integration for at least these existing enterprise processes. In other words the proposed solution package H may be selected as a potential integrated solution package for operation with each of existing enterprise process G and existing enterprise process G.

As shown in the proposed solution package H includes a proposed new enterprise process E. The proposed new enterprise process E cannot be triggered by of the process steps of any of the existing enterprise processes . Thus proposed solution package H may not be selected for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes .

In some embodiments a proposed solution package can be selected for integration of several existing enterprise processes when the proposed solution package includes multiple new enterprise processes e.g. multiple proposed new enterprise processes that each can operate with only one existing enterprise process. For example a proposed solution package can include a first new enterprise process that can be operate with e.g. triggered by a process step included in a first existing enterprise process. The proposed solution package can also include a second new enterprise process that can be operate with e.g. triggered by a process step included in a second existing enterprise process. Although each of the new enterprise processes of the proposed solution package can operate with e.g. triggered by a process step from only one existing enterprise process the proposed solution package may be used for integration of the first existing enterprise process and the second existing enterprise process because the proposed solution package is associated with multiple existing enterprise processes.

In some embodiments the existing enterprise processes and portions thereof can be represented by at least one enterprise process definition. In addition one or more of the conditions described above can be defined within one or more solution package conditions. A proposed solution package manager such as proposed solution package manager shown in can be configured to select one or more of the proposed solution packages based on the at least one enterprise process definition and the one or more solution package conditions.

As shown in the existing enterprise processes include existing enterprise processes J through J. Operational relationships between the existing enterprise processes J through J and the proposed solution package H are also illustrated as arrows Q through T. Because the operational relationships represented by arrows Q through T are associated with proposed solution package H the operational relationships can be referred to as proposed operational relationships. Although not shown in each of the existing enterprise processes can include one or more process steps that can each be mandatory process steps or optional process steps.

The proposed solution package H includes a new enterprise process P that can operate with existing enterprise process J and existing enterprise process J. Because new enterprise process P is included in the proposed solution package H new enterprise process P can be referred to as proposed new enterprise process P.

As shown in existing enterprise process J and existing enterprise process J each include an interface that can be used to trigger functionality of the new enterprise process P. The interface included in existing enterprise process J and the interface included in existing enterprise process J are both dormant interfaces that have not yet been activated to trigger e.g. not yet configured to trigger one or more functions of the new enterprise process P. Accordingly the interface included in existing enterprise process J and the interface included in existing enterprise process J can be activated e.g. configured so that the interface included in existing enterprise process J and or the interface included in existing enterprise process J can operate with e.g. trigger use one or more functions of the new enterprise process P. For example if the new enterprise process P is implemented in an integrated solution package the triggering capability of the interface of existing enterprise process J can be activated so that the existing enterprise process J can operate with e.g. trigger use the functionality of new enterprise process P.

An interface can be for example a software and or hardware interface that can be used to trigger e.g. trigger execution of for example one or more functions e.g. functions of new enterprise process P . In some embodiments the interface can be an application programming interface API . In some embodiments the interface can be a process step e.g. instances of a process step that can be referred to as a trigger process step or as a triggering process step e.g. instances of a triggering process step . In some embodiments one or more parameter values can be sent and or received via an interface. For example if implemented in a solution package the interface of existing enterprise process J can be configured to trigger one or more functions associated with new enterprise process P.

In this embodiment an integrated solution package defined e.g. defined by a solution package generator based on the proposed solution package H can include an instance of new enterprise process P i.e. proposed new enterprise process P that can be executed both existing enterprise processes J and J. In other words the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can functionally operate with both existing enterprise processes J and J. Specifically because the existing enterprise processes J and J already include interfaces with the new enterprise process P the integrated solution package can be configured so that the proposed new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can operate with the existing interfaces included in the existing enterprise processes J and J.

In some embodiments the interfaces included in the existing enterprise processes J and J can be modified e.g. replaced by different upgraded versions so that the existing enterprise processes J and J can compatibly operate with the integrated solution package including the new enterprise process P. An example of an integrated solution package defined based on the proposed integrated solution package H is shown in .

Although not shown in in some embodiments the integrated solution package can also include one or more interfaces through which the integrated solution package e.g. the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can operate with the existing enterprise processes J and J. In some embodiments the interfaces included in existing enterprise processes J and J can be removed e.g. uninstalled and the existing enterprise processes J and J and integrated solution package can be configured to operate via one or more interfaces included in only the integrated solution package . Although not shown a proposed interface that can be implemented in the integrated solution package can be represented in the proposed solution package H shown in .

Referring back to the solid arrows Q and T between existing enterprise process J and J respectively and the proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H represent mandatory operational relationships i.e. proposed mandatory operational relationships between the existing enterprise processes J and J and the proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H. If an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package H the integrated solution package must be configured to operate with both existing enterprise processes J and J because the proposed operational relationships between proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H and existing enterprise processes J and J are proposed mandatory operational relationships. The solid arrow R between existing enterprise process J and the proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H also represents a proposed mandatory operational relationship.

The proposed mandatory operational relationships between the existing enterprise processes J J and J and the proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H are contrasted with the proposed operational relationship between the existing enterprise process J and the proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H. The proposed operational relationship between existing enterprise process J and the proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H is an optional operational relationship i.e. a proposed optional operational relationship as represented by the dashed arrow S. If an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package H the integrated solution package may optionally be configured to operate with existing enterprise processes J because the proposed operational relationships between proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H and existing enterprise processes J is a proposed optional operational relationship.

In some embodiments the classification of an operational relationship as a particular type of operational relationship e.g. mandatory operational relationship an optional operational relationship can be determined based on the enterprise process definition associated with an existing enterprise process and or one or more parameter values associated with a proposed solution package. For example the proposed operational relationship between existing enterprise process J and proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H can be classified as an optional operational relationship as represented by arrow S based on an enterprise process definition associated with existing enterprise process J and or based on integration features as defined within the propose solution package H. As another example the proposed mandatory operational relationship as represented by arrow Q between existing enterprise process J and proposed new enterprise process P included in the proposed solution package H can be classified as a mandatory operational relationship based on an enterprise process definition associated with existing enterprise process J. The enterprise process definition associated with existing enterprise process J can indicate that new enterprise process P is a mandatory new enterprise process and thus integration of new enterprise process P into an integrated solution package must be mandatory.

As shown in neither existing enterprise process J nor existing enterprise process J include interfaces that can be activated to enable operation with new enterprise process P. In other words neither existing enterprise process J nor existing enterprise process J include dormant interfaces to enable operation with new enterprise process P. However as shown by the proposed operational relationships represented by arrows S and R an integrated solution package can be defined to operate with existing enterprise processes J and J. Specifically the functionality of the proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H can be made available to existing enterprise processes J and J in an integrated solution package defined based on proposed solution package H. If an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package H the integrated solution package must be configured to operate with existing enterprise process J because the proposed operational relationship between proposed new enterprise process P included in proposed solution package H and existing enterprise processes J is a proposed mandatory operational relationship. However if an integrated solution package is defined based on the proposed solution package H the integrated solution package may optionally be configured to operate with existing enterprise process J because the proposed operational relationship between proposed new enterprise process P and existing enterprise processes J is a proposed optional operational relationship. In some embodiments a user can trigger or not trigger defining of the integrated solution package so that the integrated solution package can operate with existing enterprise process J.

Referring again to the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package is configured to operate with existing enterprise process J e.g. a new enterprise process within existing enterprise process J via an interface included in existing enterprise process J. However the new enterprise process P of the integrated solution package is not configured to operate with existing enterprise process J because the optional operational relationship between the proposed new enterprise process P of the proposed solution package H shown in was not triggered for implementation in the integrated solution package .

Although not shown in in some embodiments the integrated solution package can also include one or more interfaces through which the integrated solution package e.g. the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can operate with the existing enterprise processes J. In some embodiments an interface would not be installed in existing enterprise process J and integrated solution package would be configured to operate with existing enterprise process J via one or more interfaces included in only the integrated solution package .

The arrows shown in and the arrows Q R S and T shown in originate at the existing enterprise processes and terminate at the integrated solution package . The direction of the arrows indicates that the functionality in the integrated solution package and the proposed integrated solution package H shown in is triggered at the existing enterprise processes . In other words the existing enterprise processes are configured to trigger the functionality in the integrated solution package . In some embodiments the integrated solution package can be configured to trigger one or more functions included in one or more of the existing enterprise processes . In such embodiments an arrow for example can originate at the integrated solution package and terminate at the one or more of the existing enterprise processes to illustrate the triggering direction. In some embodiments triggering can be bidirectional as represented by for example double sided arrows. In other words the integrated solution package can be configured to trigger one or more functions included in one or more of the existing enterprise processes and one or more of the existing enterprise processes can be configured to trigger one more functions of the integrated solution package .

In some embodiments the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can be an upgrade to one or more of the existing enterprise processes and or portions thereof . For example the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package can be an upgrade version to the program version of the existing enterprise processes shown in . Accordingly the existing enterprise processes may be modified e.g. upgraded to a different program version so that the existing enterprise processes may operate with the new enterprise process P. In some embodiments modifying the existing enterprise processes may be a prerequisite for the existing enterprise processes to operate with the new enterprise process P. As a specific example the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package may be associated with a program version 5.0 and the existing enterprise processes shown in may be associated with a program version 4.0 which may not be entirely compatible with program version 5.0 . The existing enterprise processes may be upgraded from program version 4.0 to a program version that is compatible with program version 5.0 so that the existing enterprise processes may connect with the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package in a desirable fashion.

In some embodiments one or more interfaces included in the existing enterprise processes and or the integrated solution package can be or can be associated with an upgraded version or an installed version. For example the interface included in existing enterprise process J can be changed from an installed version of the interface to an upgraded version of the interface when the integrated solution package is defined. In some embodiments the integrated solution package can be configured to operate via an installed version of an interface even though the new enterprise process P included in the integrated solution package may be an upgraded version.

As shown in the existing enterprise processes include existing enterprise process X through X. Although not shown in each of the existing enterprise processes can include one or more process steps that can each be mandatory process steps or optional process steps. In some embodiments one or more of the process steps can be triggering process steps e.g. dormant triggering process steps . In this embodiment interfaces which can be included in one or more process steps at the existing enterprise processes and proposed interfaces at the proposed solution package T are not shown.

In this embodiment the existing enterprise processes X through X collectively define an end to end existing enterprise process as represented in by arrows between the existing enterprise processes . For example data produced by existing enterprise process X can be processed by existing enterprise process X as represented by the arrow between existing enterprise process X and existing enterprise process X.

In some embodiments the existing enterprise processes X through X can be any type of enterprise process. For example the existing enterprise process X can be a quotation enterprise process the existing enterprise process X can be a sales order from stock enterprise process the existing enterprise process X can be an outbound delivery enterprise process and the existing enterprise process X can be an post goods issue enterprise process.

As shown in the proposed solution package T includes proposed new enterprise processes K and K. The new enterprise processes K and K included in the proposed solution package T can be considered upgrades to the existing enterprise processes . For example the proposed new enterprise process K included in proposed solution package T can include upgraded functionality that can operate with e.g. can be accessed by can be triggered by existing enterprise process X.

As shown in a proposed optional operational relationship between existing enterprise process X and the proposed new enterprise process K of proposed solution package T is represented by dashed arrow U. A proposed optional operational relationship between existing enterprise process X and the proposed new enterprise process K of proposed solution package T is represented by dashed arrow V. A proposed mandatory operational relationship between existing enterprise process X and the proposed new enterprise process K of proposed solution package T is represented by solid arrow L. A proposed optional operational relationship between existing enterprise process X and the proposed new enterprise process K of proposed solution package T is represented by solid arrow W.

In some embodiments the new enterprise processes K and K can be any type of enterprise process. For example the new enterprise process K can be a credit check enterprise process and the new enterprise process K can be a credit update enterprise process.

As shown in proposed new enterprise process K shown as K is illustrated in a column associated with Optional New Enterprise Processes as being an optional new enterprise process that can operate with existing enterprise process X in an integrated solution package. The placement of proposed new enterprise process K in association with existing enterprise process X in the enterprise process user interface is a representation of the proposed optional operational relationship V shown in . Similarly proposed new enterprise process K is also illustrated in the column associated with Optional New Enterprise Processes as being an optional new enterprise process that can operate with existing enterprise process X in an integrated solution package and proposed new enterprise process K shown as K is illustrated in the column associated with Optional New Enterprise Processes as being an optional new enterprise process that can operate with existing enterprise process X in an integrated solution package.

Each of the optional new enterprise processes shown in is placed next to a set of selection boxes that can each be used to select whether or not an integrated solution package should be configured so that one or more of the proposed new enterprise process can operate with one or more of the existing enterprise processes. As shown in the X in the selection box from the set of selection boxes next to proposed new enterprise process K in the Optional New enterprise processes indicates that an integrated solution package when defined will enable proposed new enterprise process K to operate with existing enterprise process X. The X the selection box next to proposed new enterprise process K can represent that the proposed new enterprise process K will operate with the existing enterprise process X when implemented in an integrated solution package . The absence of a mark in the selection box next to proposed new enterprise process K which is associated with existing enterprise process X can represent that new enterprise process K will not operate with existing enterprise process X in an integrated solution package.

As shown in proposed new enterprise process K shown as K is illustrated as a mandatory new enterprise process that must be included in an integrated solution package for the existing enterprise process X because proposed new enterprise process K is shown in a column associated with Mandatory New enterprise processes . As shown in the proposed new enterprise process K is not associated with a selection box because an integrated solution package must include a binding between the proposed new enterprise process K and the existing enterprise process X.

As shown in one or more functional options F through F which are included in a column associated with Functional Options can be selected via the selection boxes . A functional option can represent additional selectable functionality associated with one or more of the new enterprise processes. For example if new enterprise process K is a credit check new enterprise process the functional options F through F can represent types of credit checks. Functional option F can represent a credit limit check functional option F can represent an oldest open item credit check and functional option F can represent a highest dunning level credit check.

The enterprise process user interface also includes a Generate Solution Package button. In response to the Generate Solution Package button being actuated an integrated solution package with the selected integration features can be produced by for example a solution package generator such as solution package generator shown in .

In some embodiments process steps rather than enterprise processes can be included in an integrated solution package. Such an example is described in connection with .

As shown in proposed process step W of the proposed solution package G corresponds with process step W which can be referred to as installed process step W included in the existing enterprise process W as represented by arrow Ml . In this embodiment because the proposed process step W of the proposed solution package G corresponds with a process step included in only one of the existing enterprise processes the proposed solution package G may not be selected for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes . In other words the proposed solution package G may not be selected as a potential integrated solution package for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes .

As shown in proposed process steps W and W of the proposed solution package W correspond respectively with process steps W and W which can be referred to as installed process steps W and W included in the existing enterprise process W as respectively represented by arrow N and O . Also as illustrated by arrow P proposed process step W of the proposed solution package W can be included as a process step after process step W of existing enterprise process W. The inclusion of proposed process step W in existing enterprise process W can be considered an upgrade to existing enterprise process W because proposed process step W is currently not included in existing enterprise process W. Although not shown in in some embodiments proposed process step W could be inserted as an upgrade between process steps already included in existing enterprise process W.

In this embodiment because the proposed solution package W includes at least one process step proposed process step W associated with existing enterprise processes W and W the proposed solution package W may be selected for integration for at least these existing enterprise processes. In other words the proposed solution package W may be selected as a potential integrated solution package for integration of at least one process step from each of existing enterprise process W and existing enterprise process W.

As shown in the proposed solution package G includes a proposed process step G. The proposed process step G neither corresponds with a process step from any of the existing enterprise processes nor can be included as a process step after any of the existing enterprise processes . Thus proposed solution package G may not be selected for integration of any of the existing enterprise processes .

In some embodiments a proposed solution package can be selected for integration of several existing enterprise processes when the proposed solution package includes multiple process steps e.g. multiple proposed process steps that each are associated with only one existing enterprise process. For example a proposed solution package can include a first process step that corresponds with a process step included in a first existing enterprise process. The proposed solution package can also include a second process step that corresponds with a process step included in a second existing enterprise process. Although each of the process steps of the proposed solution package corresponds with a process step of only one existing enterprise process the proposed solution package may be used for integration of the first existing enterprise process and the second existing enterprise process because the proposed solution package is associated with multiple existing enterprise processes.

In some embodiments a proposed solution package may not be selected for integration when a process step e.g. a proposed process step of the proposed solution package is not an upgrade to at least one process step from multiple existing enterprise processes. For example a proposed solution package can include a process step that corresponds with a process step included in a first existing enterprise process and a process step included in a second existing enterprise process. If the process step included in solution package is an upgrade to only the process step included in the first existing enterprise process but not the process step included in the second existing enterprise process the proposed solution package may not be selected for integration of the first existing enterprise process in the second existing enterprise process.

In some embodiments the existing enterprise processes and portions thereof can be represented by at least one enterprise process definition. In addition one or more of the conditions described above can be defined within one or more solution package conditions. A proposed solution package manager such as proposed solution package manager shown in can be configured to select one or more of the proposed solution packages based on the at least one enterprise process definition and the one or more solution package conditions.

Also as shown in each of the enterprise processes from the end to end enterprise process has an operational relationship with at least one enterprise process from the credit management solution package . Mandatory operational relationships are represented by solid arrows between the enterprise processes from the end to end enterprise process and the credit management solution package . Optional operational relationships are represented by dashed arrows between the enterprise processes from the end to end enterprise process and the credit management solution package .

The credit management solution package includes a credit check enterprise process a credit update enterprise process and a credit clearing enterprise process. The credit management solution package also includes a credit master database . As shown in the credit master database can be accessed by the credit check enterprise process and the credit update enterprise process.

Each of the enterprise processes included in the end to end process includes at least one interface configured to trigger one or more functions associated with the credit management solution package . Specifically each of the enterprise processes included in the end to end process includes at least one of a credit check trigger or a credit update trigger. For example the quotation enterprise process includes an instance of the credit check trigger that enables an operational relationship e.g. a bidirectional operational relationship a single direction operational relationship between the credit check enterprise process included in the credit management solution package and the quotation enterprise process. Similarly the sales order from stock enterprise process includes an instance of the credit update trigger that enables an operational relationship e.g. a bidirectional operational relationship a single direction operational relationship between the credit update enterprise process included in the credit management solution package and the sales order from stock enterprise process. In some embodiments the credit check trigger and or the credit update trigger can be included in as a function or can be a process step. In some embodiments one or more of the interfaces can be dormant interfaces that are or can be activated. Although not shown in in some embodiments less than all of the enterprise processes included in an end to end process may have an interface with an integrated solution package.

The boxes behind some of the enterprise processes shown in the end to end process represent variants of the respective enterprise processes. For example the box behind the quotation enterprise process represents a variant of the quotation enterprise process. In some embodiments the credit check trigger included in the quotation enterprise process can be the same as e.g. can share the credit check trigger associated with a variant of the quotation enterprise process. In some embodiments the credit check trigger associated each of with variants can be different.

In some embodiments the interfaces included in some of the enterprise processes of the end to end process can be different. For example the credit check trigger included in outbound delivery can be different than e.g. a different version of a different implementation of the credit check trigger included in post goods issue . In other words the credit check trigger included in outbound delivery and the credit check trigger included in post goods issue may not be instances of the same credit check trigger.
