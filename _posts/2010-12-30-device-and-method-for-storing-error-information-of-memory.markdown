The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2010 0116819 filed on Nov. 23 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to semiconductor memory devices and more particularly to a device and method for storing error information in a memory device which is applicable to any semiconductor memory chip.

In the early stage of the memory semiconductor industry a larger number of original good dies which had no defective cell in a memory chip that passed through a semiconductor fabrication process were distributed on a wafer. However as the memory capacity has increased it has become difficult to fabricate a memory chip without a defective cell. At the present time there is a small chance that a memory chip will be fabricated without a defective cell.

In order to overcome this limitation a method for replacing a defective memory cell with a spare memory cell i.e. a redundancy memory cell has been proposed. In order to replace a defective memory cell with a redundancy memory cell a solution thereof must be calculated by using external equipment. Research is being conducted to install such a repair circuit i.e. a memory self repair circuit in a memory chip.

Three main parameters to be considered for a memory self repair circuit may be an area a repair rate and an analysis speed of a repair circuit. The area is a parameter connected directly with the semiconductor chip fabrication cost. The repair rate is an important parameter connected with the yield of a semiconductor device. The analysis speed of a repair circuit may also be regarded as a parameter connected directly with the semiconductor chip fabrication cost because it is proportional to a test time.

A repair most method is disclosed in the prior art e.g. M. Tarr D. Boudreau and R. Murphy Defect analysis system speeds test and repair of redundant memories Electronics vol. 57 pp. 175 179 Jan. 12 1984 . A repair most method stores the number of defective cells of each row column address detected during a test process compares the number of defective cells of each row column address after completion of the test process and replaces a defective memory cell with a redundancy memory cell in descending order of the number of defects at an address. However the repair most method of the prior art utilizes a large area because it requires a large capacity buffer for storing a defective bit map. Also the repair most method of the prior art may have a long defect analysis repair time because it can perform a defect repair operation only after completion of a test process.

A local repair most method is also disclosed in the prior art e.g. C. T. Huang C. F. Wu J. F. Li and C. W. Wu Built in Redundancy Analysis for Memory Yield Improvement IEEE Trans. Reliability vol. 52 pp. 386 399 December 2003 . The local repair most method of the prior art uses a small sized defect bit map to reduce the area while applying a method similar to the repair most method. However the local repair most method of the prior art cannot store all information for efficient repairs due to a small sized bit map and cannot repair more than a predetermined number of defects due to insufficient information stored i.e. cannot repair defects due to insufficient information even in the case of sufficient redundancy memory thus reducing the repair rate.

Also an essential spare pivot method has been disclosed. The essential spare pivot method stores only core defect addresses instead of a defect bit map in order to reduce the area. Therefore a defect address collecting process is performed during a test process thus improving the analysis speed of a self test circuit. However a register capacity for storing defect addresses is insufficient thus reducing the repair rate.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a defect address storing device that can store all information regarding defective cells in a reduced area.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are also directed to a device and method for storing error information of a memory device which can improve the analysis speed of a self repair circuit including a defect address storing device by storing defective cell addresses in the defect address storing device in real time during a test process.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a device for storing error information of a memory device includes a plurality of parent memories each storing a row address and a column address of one defective cell and a plurality of child memories each storing a column address of a defective cell having a row address identical to a row address stored in the corresponding parent memory or storing a row address of a defective cell having a column address identical to a column address stored in the corresponding parent memory wherein each of the parent memories stores first information about whether a row repair must be performed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory and second information about whether a column repair must be performed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory.

The first information stored in each of the parent memories may indicate a row repair must be performed when the number of defective cells with the same row address exceeds the number of redundancy columns. The second information stored in each of the parent memories may indicate a column repair must be performed when the number of defective cells the same column address exceeds the number of redundancy rows.

In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a device for storing error information of a memory device includes a plurality of parent memories each storing a column address a row address a column must repair flag for the column address and a row must repair flag for the row address and a plurality of child memories each storing an address address information indicating whether the address is a row address or a column address and pointer information indicating which one of the parent memories correspond to the child memory.

The column must repair flag may be activated if the number of defective cells with the same column address exceeds the number of redundancy rows. The row must repair flag may be activated if the number of defective cells the same row address exceeds the number of redundancy columns.

In accordance with still another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method for storing error information of a memory device in a fault information storing device including a plurality of parent memories and a plurality of child memories includes ignoring a defective cell if the defective cell belongs to a row or a column classified as a must repair indicating that the row or column has been classified as a must repair in the parent memory storing the row or column if the row or column of the defective cell is to be classified as a new must repair and storing information about the defective cell in one of the parent memories or one of the child memories if the ignoring and the indicating operations are not performed.

The indicating operation may include activating a row must repair flag of the parent memory storing the row of the defective cell if the number of defective cells belonging to the row exceeds the number of redundancy columns and activating a column must repair flag of the parent memory storing the column of the defective cell if the number of defective cells belonging to the column exceeds the number of redundancy rows.

In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a memory device includes a memory cell array comprising a plurality of memory cells arranged in rows and columns and a fault information storing device configured to store row addresses and column addresses of defective memory cells and to store a row must repair flag and a column must repair flag.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may however be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.

First a repair rate and a defect classification method will be described for a better understanding of the present invention.

The optimal repair rate is 100 . The repair rate becomes 100 if one or more solutions can be found whenever a defect is repairable. In Equation 1 the denominator is the number of repairable chips. Therefore the impossibility of finding a solution for an unrepairable case i.e. the case where the number of defects exceeds the number of defects that can be covered by redundancy memory cells does not affect the repair rate. In order to increase the repair rate a fault information storing device preferably stores all information for a repair operation.

Reference character Rs denotes the number of redundancy rows and reference character Cs denotes the number of redundancy columns. Hereinafter it is assumed that Rs 2 and Cs 2.

A single fault refers to the case when there is no other defective cell at a column address and a row address where a defective cell is located. Referring to a defective cell A located at row and column is classified as a single fault because there are no other defective cells in row and no other defective cells in column .

A single fault may be repaired by replacing it with one redundancy row or one redundancy column. For example the defective cell A of may be repaired by replacing row with a redundancy row or replacing column with a redundancy column.

A row line fault may be repaired by replacing the k defective cells with one redundancy row or k redundancy columns. Also a column line fault may be repaired by replacing the j defective cells with one redundancy column or j redundancy rows. For example the defective cells B of may be repaired by replacing row with a redundancy row or replacing columns and with redundancy columns.

When there are k where k Cs defective cells at a row address the k defective cells are collectively referred to as a row must repair fault line or a must repair faulty row line . Also when there are j where j Rs defective cells at a column address the j defective cells are collectively referred to as a column must repair fault line or a must repair faulty column line . Thus the defective cells C of are classified as a row must repair fault line because the number of defective cells with the same row address e.g. row is which is greater than the number of redundancy columns Cs which is 2.

A row must repair fault line must be repaired by replacing it with a redundancy row. Likewise a column must repair fault line must be repaired by replacing it with a redundancy column. For example the defective cells C of must be repaired by replacing row with a redundancy row.

Referring to a fault information storing device in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of parent memories PM  PM X and a plurality of child memories CM  CM Y. Each of the parent memories PM  PM X stores a column address and a row address of one defective cell and also stores information about whether a row repair is needed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory i.e. whether a row must repair fault line exists and information about whether a column repair must be needed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory i.e. whether a column must repair fault line exists . Each of the child memories CM  CM Y stores a column address of a defective cell having a row address identical to the row address stored in the corresponding parent memory or stores a row address of a defective cell having a column address identical to the column address stored in the corresponding parent memory.

Each of the parent memories PM  PM X stores information about a defective cell having no overlapping address among the row addresses and the column addresses of the defective cells stored in another parent memory among the defective cells detected as a result of a test process. For example if an address of row and column is not stored in another parent memory at the time of detection of a defective cell at row and column the address of the defective cell at row and column is stored in a parent memory. Further if the detected defective cell belongs to a must repair faulty line the parent memory also stores information thereof.

A parent enable flag indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is valid or not. If the parent enable flag is 1 the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is valid and if the parent enable flag is 0 the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is invalid. Here the parent enable flag occupies a 1 bit storage space.

A row address of a defective cell is stored in a corresponding parent memory. A storage space necessary to store the row address varies according to the number of bits of the row address. For example if the row address is comprised of 10 bits a 10 bit storage space is necessary to store the same. In M denotes the number of all rows. If M is 1024 the row address may be comprised of 10 bits log1024 .

A column address of a defective cell stored in a corresponding parent memory. A storage space necessary to store the column address varies according to the number of bits of the column address. For example if the column address is comprised of 10 bits a 10 bit storage space is necessary to store the same. In N denotes the number of all columns. If N is 512 the column address may be comprised of 9 bits log2512 .

A row must flag indicates whether a row having the row address stored in the corresponding parent memory contains defective cells that are classified as a row must repair fault line. If the row must flag is 1 it indicates that a row must repair fault line exists at a particular row address and if the row must flag is 0 it indicates that a row must repair fault line does not exist at a particular row address. Here the row must flag occupies a 1 bit storage space.

A column must flag indicates whether a column having the column address stored in the corresponding parent memory contains defective cells that are classified as a column must repair fault line. If the column must flag is 1 it indicates that a column must repair fault line exists at a particular column address and if the column must flag is 0 it indicates that a column must repair fault line does not exist at a particular column address. Here the column must flag occupies a 1 bit storage space.

The parent memories PM  PM X are as many as the total redundancy number i.e. Rs Cs. The number of defective cells that all the parent memories PM  PM X can record is equal to the total redundancy number. If the number of defective cells to be recorded in the parent memories PM  PM X is greater than Rs Cs the memory is classified as unrepairable memory.

The child memories CM  CM Y correspond to one of the parent memories PM  PM X respectively. Each of the child memories CM  CM Y shares a column address or a row address with its corresponding parent memory PM  PM X. Further each of the child memories CM  CM Y may store information about a defective cell which belongs to a faulty line e.g. sparse faulty line or must repair faulty line with the column address or the row address stored in the parent memory PM  PM X. If the row address of the detected defective cell is stored in any one of the parent memories PM  PM X information about the defective cell is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory. Also if the column address of the detected defective cell is stored in any one of the parent memories PM  PM X information about the corresponding defective cell is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory. For example if row and column is already stored in the parent memory PM  when a defective cell at row and column is detected the column address of the defective cell i.e. the column address corresponding to column is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory PM .

A child enable flag indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding child memory is valid or not. If the child enable flag is 1 the address stored in the corresponding child memory is valid and if the child enable flag is 0 the address stored in the corresponding child memory is invalid. Here the child enable flag occupies a 1 bit storage space.

A row or column address of a defective cell is stored in a corresponding child memory. A storage space necessary to store the address is determined by the larger one of the number of bits of a row address and the number of bits of a column address. For example if the row address is 9 bits and the column address is 10 bits the storage space for storing the address occupies 10 bits in the child memory.

Address information indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a row address or a column address. If the address information is 0 the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a row address and if the address information is 1 the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a column address. Accordingly the address information occupies a 1 bit storage space.

Pointer information indicates the parent memory corresponding to the child memory storing the pointer information. For example if the pointer information of a child memory is 4 it may indicate that the child memory corresponds to the parent memory PM . The number of bits of the pointer information is determined according to the number of parent memories PM  PM X number of parent memories Rs Cs . Specifically the number of bits of the pointer information is equal to log Rs Cs .

The number of child memories CM  CM X is equal to Rs Cs 1 Cs Rs 1 . Therefore the sum of the number of parent memories PM  PM X and the number of child memories CM  CM X is 2 Rs Cs. This sum represents the maximum number of defective cell addresses that can be stored to repair the memory with a given redundancy memory. Accordingly the total number of bits of data to be stored by the parent memory and the child memory in accordance with the present invention is relatively small. Therefore the area of the fault information storing device of the present invention is reduced as compared to that of the prior art.

The fault information storing device in accordance with the present invention classifies information about defective cells according to the row and column addresses of the defective cells. A defective cell stored in the parent memory with the assistance of a corresponding child memory belongs to a faulty line i.e. sparse faulty line or must repair faulty line . A defective cell stored in the parent memory without the assistance of a child memory corresponds to a single fault. Further a defective cell stored in the parent memory storing an activated must repair flag belongs to a must repair faulty line.

Referring to when a defective cell is detected it is determined whether the detected defective cell belongs to a row address classified as a must repair or a column address classified as a must repair S . If it is determined that the detected defective cell belongs to a must repair information about the detected defective cell is ignored because it is no more necessary. That is information about the defective cell detected at a column address or a row address classified as a must repair is not stored.

Thereafter it is determined whether the address identical to the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell is already stored in the parent memory S . If the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are not already stored in the parent memory the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are written in the parent memory S .

If one of the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell is already stored in the parent memory it is determined whether the defective cell is to be classified as belonging to a new must repair faulty line S . If the defective cell is to be classified as a new column must repair faulty line or a new row must repair faulty line a must repair flag of the parent memory corresponding to the detected defective cell i.e. the parent memory storing the column address or the row address identical to that of the detected defective cell is activated S . Herein if the defective cell is classified as belonging to a column must repair faulty line a column must repair flag is activated and if the defective cell is classified as belonging to a row must repair faulty line a row must repair flag is activated.

If the defective cell is not to be classified as belonging to a must repair faulty line then the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell is stored in the child memory S .

That is in accordance with the present invention if a defective is cell is detected the detected defective cell is not ignored i.e. path NO in S is taken then one of three steps are performed 1 the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are stored in the parent memory S 2 the must repair flag of the parent memory is activated by the detected defective cell S or 3 the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell are stored in the child memory S .

In a repeat count value indicates the number of defective cells that have been previously detected at the same row address as the row address of the most recently detected defective cell and the number of defective cells detected that have been previously detected at the same column address as the column address of the most recently detected defective cell. The repeat count value is used to determine where e.g. in parent memory or in child memory information about a defective cell is to be stored. However the repeat count value is not stored in the fault information storing device.

Referring to process a of defective cell is the first detected defective cell. The column address and the row address of defective cell are compared with the column address and the row address stored in the parent memories PM  PM . However because no column addresses or row addresses have been written in the parent memories PM  PM  at the time of detection of defective cell the column address and the row address of defective cell are written in the parent memory PM . Also it can be seen from that the parent enable flag of the parent memory PM  is written as 1 the row address ADDR R is written as 5 and the column address ADDR C is written as 0 .

Referring to process b of when defective cell is detected the column address and the row address of defective cell are compared with the column address and the row address stored in the parent memories PM  PM . Because the row address of defective cell is identical to the row address written in the parent memory PM  the column address of defective cell is written in the child memory CM . The child enable flag of the child memory CM  is written as 1 the address ADDR is written as 3 and the address descriptor ADD DES is written as 1 to indicate that the written address is a column address. Also the pointer information POINTER is written as 0 to indicate that the child memory CM  corresponds to the parent memory PM .

Referring to process c of the column address and the row address of defective cell are not identical to the row and column addresses that have been previously written in the parent memories PM  PM . Likewise the column address and the row address of defective cell are not identical to the row and column addresses that have been previously written in the parent memories PM  PM . Thus the column address and the row address of defective cell are written in the parent memory PM  and the column address and the row address of defective cell are stored in the parent memory PM .

Referring to process d of the column address of defective cell is identical to the column address previously written in the parent memory PM . Thus the row address of defective cell is stored in the child memory CM . The child enable flag ENABLE of the child memory CM  is written as 1 the address ADDR is written as and the address descriptor ADD DES is written as 0 to indicate that the written address is a row address. Also the pointer information POINTER is written as 0 to indicate that the child memory CM  corresponds to the parent memory PM . Because the column address and the row address of defective cell are not identical to the row and column addresses previously written in the parent memories PM  PM  defective cell is written in the parent memory PM .

Referring to process e of the row address of defective cell is identical to the row address written in the parent memory PM . Herein it can be seen that the repeat count value is 2 0 which indicates that the number of defective cells detected previously at the row address of defective cell is 2. The number of defective cells detected at the same row address including defective cell becomes 3 which exceeds the number of redundancy columns Cs 2 . Accordingly each of defective cells and sharing the row address must be classified as belonging to a row must repair faulty line. Thus the row must repair flag MUST R of the parent memory PM  is activated to T. Also because information about defective cell detected at the row address does not need to be stored any more the child enable flag ENABLE of the child memory CM  is deactivated to 0 .

Referring to process f of the column address of defective cell is identical to the column address written in the parent memory PM . Thus the enable flag ENABLE of the child memory CM  is written as 1 the address ADDR is written as 1 the address descriptor ADD DES is written as 0 to indicate that the written address is a row address and the pointer information POINTER is written as 1 to indicate that the child memory corresponds to the parent memory PM .

Through the processes a to f of complete information for repairing the defective cells is stored in the fault information storing device. According to the information stored in the fault information storing device the address of a row must repair and the address of a column must repair can be detected and the locations of defective cells categorized as other faults than a must repair faulty line i.e. categorized as a single fault or belonging to a sparse faulty line can be detected.

Accordingly defective cells in must repair faulty lines can be identified so that they can be repaired without overly burdensome analysis. Also because the locations of all defective cells categorized as a single fault or belonging to a sparse faulty line can be detected the detected locations of the defective cells can be readily analyzed to determine how to repair the defective cells. Thus the present invention can achieve a 100 repair rate by using the information stored in the fault information storing device.

For each of the present invention prior art and prior art illustrates the area of the fault information storing device that changes according to a change in the number of redundancy columns Cs in a case where the memory is comprised of 1024 rows 1024 columns and the number of redundancy rows Rs is 5. It can be seen from that the fault information storing device of the present invention occupies a much smaller area than that of prior art . However the fault information storing device of the present invention occupies a larger area than that of prior art . This is because prior art omits storing information about defective cells and therefore cannot achieve a 100 repair rate.

For each of the present invention prior art and prior art illustrates the area of the fault information storing device that changes according to a change in the memory capacity in a case where the number of redundancy rows Rs is 5 and the number of redundancy columns Cs is 5. It can be seen from that the fault information storing device of the present invention occupies a much smaller area than that of prior art .

For reference the area of the fault information storing device of the present invention is calculated using Equation 2 below the area of the fault information storing device of prior art is calculated using Equation 3 below and the area of the fault information storing device of prior art is calculated using Equation 4 below. Herein M denotes the number of rows of the memory and N denotes the number of columns of the memory. Area log log3 1 1 log max log 2 Eq. 2 Area log1 log 1 log1 log 1 where 1 1 and log1 log1 Eq. 3 Area log1 log1 where log 1 log1 Eq. 4

As described above the repair information storing device and method according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention can store all information necessary for a repair operation in a reduced area. Thus the repair information storing device and method according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention can increase the repair rate while reducing the circuit area.

While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.
