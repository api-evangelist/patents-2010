title: Composite pavement structures
abstract: A composite pavement structure comprises a wearing course layer and a base course layer disposed below the wearing course layer. The wearing course layer comprises aggregate, e.g. glass and rock, and an elastomeric composition. The elastomeric composition comprises the reaction product of an isocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component. The isocyanate component comprises a polymeric isocyanate, and optionally, an isocyanate-prepolymer. The isocyanate-reactive component comprises a hydrophobic polyol and a chain extender having at least two hydroxyl groups and a molecular weight of from about 62 to about 220. The chain extender is present in the isocyanate-reactive component in an amount of from about 1 to about 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the isocyanate-reactive component. The base course layer comprises aggregate which is the same or different than the aggregate of the wearing course layer. Methods of forming the composite pavement structure are also disclosed.
