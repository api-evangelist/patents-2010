title: Platform with cooling circuit
abstract: A turbine engine component has an airfoil portion, which airfoil portion is bounded by a platform at one end. The platform has an as-cast open cavity bordered by at least one as-cast landing. A plate is welded to the at least one as-cast landing to cover and close the as-cast open cavity. A process for forming the turbine engine component is described.

The subject matter described herein was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 02 C 3003 award by the Department of the Navy. The government of the United States of America may have rights to the subject matter described herein.

The present disclosure is directed to a turbine engine component having a platform with a cooling circuit and a process for forming same.

Currently a high level of cooling technology for turbine airfoil platforms involves the placement of a miniature core within the wall of the platform. This core is suspended between the hot side of the wall or gas path and the cold side of the wall. This technology pulls air from the cold non gas path side through a number of cooling fins i.e. trip strips protruding from the gas path side and pins or pedestals spanning between the hot and cold walls. The air is evacuated out onto the gas path surface where the air spreads out on the surface to create a thin film of cooler air to help further protect the surface from hot gas path air.

This technology works extraordinarily well however it is complicated to implement in turbine vanes. It requires a four piece wax assembly for a turbine doublet which is not production friendly. The technology is expensive.

An inexpensive approach to forming a turbine engine component with a platform cavity is described herein.

In accordance with the present disclosure a turbine engine component broadly comprises an airfoil portion said airfoil portion being bounded by a platform at one end said platform having an as cast open cavity bordered by at least one as cast landing and a plate welded to said at least one as cast landing to cover said as cast open cavity.

Further in accordance with the present disclosure there is provided a process for forming a turbine engine component comprising the steps of casting a turbine engine component having an airfoil portion with a pressure side and a suction side and a platform with an open cavity and a landing positioned on a periphery of said cavity positioning a plate over an opening in said open cavity and welding said plate to said landing to close said cavity.

Other details of the platform with cooling circuit are set forth in the following detailed description in which like reference numerals depict like elements.

Referring now to there is shown a turbine vane with a covered platform cavity . The vane has outer and inner platforms with an airfoil spanning between them. The airfoil has multiple internal cavities and and has both a pressure or concave side and a suction or convex side . The outer and inner platforms and respectively have both a hot gas path side and a cooler non gas path side . The outer platform has a platform cavity which is formed by welding a plate onto the vane . The entrance to the cavity is a hole extending through the plate . This hole allows the cooler air on the non gas path side to enter the platform cavity and flow through the cavity to exit onto the hot gas path side of the outer platform where this air creates a thin film of cooler air on the surface which protects that surface from the hot gas path air.

The hole in the plate is positioned over an entrance area of the casting . The hole allows cooling fluid from the non hot gas side of the platform to enter the cavity . Holes are drilled into or otherwise formed in the exit area of the cavity so that the air can flow out of the cavity into the hot air gas path. shows the arduous paths the air must travel from the entrance of the cavity to the holes to exit onto the gas path side of the platform . It should be noted that the plate does not add any appreciable structural member to the platform as its cored counterpart.

As can be seen from the airfoil has a chord line . The cavity may be located on either the pressure side or the suction side of the chord line .

The process for forming the turbine engine component involves positioning the cores and in a mold not shown . The turbine engine component is then formed by a casting technique wherein molten metal is poured into the mold not shown . As a result of the casting process and subsequent solidification of the molten metal there is formed a component having the airfoil with the pressure side and the suction side the platforms and the open cavity in the platform the protrusions the at least one trip strip the entrance area the exit area and the peripheral landing . Following solidification the cores and may be removed using any suitable technique such as leaching known in the art. The plate may then be attached to the outer platform using any suitable welding or brazing technique known in the art. The exit holes may be formed either before or after the plate is installed. The exit holes may be formed using a drilling technique such as EDM.

One significant advantage to the technique described herein is that it is inexpensive. Another advantage is that while the entrance may be located at the leading edge of the cavity and the exit holes may be located at the trailing edge of the cavity it is entirely feasible to reverse the structure as shown in . This means that the same air which is used to cool the back side of the platform flowing forward can be used to create a protective cooling air film on the gas path side flowing aftward over the same region. This reverse flow is not possible using a mini core configuration due to the shape of the exits. The present technique may provide a distinct advantage in areas that can not be cooled by enhanced back side cooling alone.

There has been provided in accordance with the present disclosure a platform with a cooling circuit. While the present disclosure has been made in the context of one or more embodiments it should be apparent that unforeseen alternatives modifications and variations may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. It is therefore intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
