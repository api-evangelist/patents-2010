The present application is related to co filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 953 385 entitled Process of Finding Out if Software Will Run on an Operating System Without Installing That Software and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 953 286 entitled Find and Track Information of Interface Usage of Software Libraries by Other Software and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 953 023 entitled Mechanism for Providing Customized Visualization of Application Binary Interface Application Programming Interface Related Information which are assigned to the assignee of the present application.

The embodiments of the invention relate generally to software compatibility and more specifically relate to providing a mechanism for determining support criteria for shared libraries based on their priority levels.

Multiple software programs that run on a computing device often share libraries provided by the based operating system employed at the computing device. For example these libraries can be used by the software programs to access various library or operating system functions e.g. reading files writing files file management network communications inter process communications memory management string manipulations user interface manipulations mathematics functions etc. . Typically these libraries change when the operating system changes or is updated for example upgrading to a newer version of an operating system can change the functions presented in one or more shared libraries change versions and arguments used in these functions and or change functionalities of some none or all of the library functions. As a result a software program developed for one operating system may not work on another operating system and similarly upgrading to the new operating system may cause a software program not to work on the new or updated operating system. To determine whether a software program is executable on a new or updated operating system the software program is typically re compiled to run on the new or updated operating system.

The aforementioned re compiling and re running of the software program is further complicated when multiple software programs are involved and further they include customer generated software programs e.g. third party software programs that are created and provided by sources independent of the one providing the operating system and shared libraries . Furthermore a user e.g. software developer system administrator etc. remains unaware as to which of the shared libraries are important to the multiple third party software programs running on the operating system consequently by updating a shared library provided by the base operating system the user risks breaking existing software and adding to inefficiency by wasting system resources.

Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for determining support criteria for shared libraries based on their priority levels is described. A method of embodiments of the invention includes extracting interface provisioning detail relating to interfaces associated with shared libraries provided by an operating system running on a computer system. The interfaces include application binary interfaces ABIs . The method further includes detecting interface usage detail associated with the interfaces. The interface usage detail is based on a frequency at which one or more interfaces are used by one or more third party software programs running on the operating system. The method further includes comparing the interface provisioning detail with the interface usage detail to determine an importance level of each shared library and analyzing comparison results obtained from the comparison. The analyzing includes assigning a priority level to each shared library based on its importance level.

The embodiments of the present invention are provided for determining support criteria for shared libraries based on their priority levels. In one embodiment ABIs application programming interfaces APIs provisioning data including a list of ABIs and APIs associated with shared libraries and their associated metadata relating to software programs running on a computer system is extracted and stored on a database in communication with the computer system. Further ABI API usage detail of various ABIs and APIs being accessed and used by third party software programs is detected and stored in the database. In one embodiment ABI API provisioning and usage details are compared with each other and then analyzed to determine priority levels of various shared libraries. These priority levels allow a user to assess a level of importance associated with each shared library.

These priority levels are then used by the provider of the shared libraries to establish support criteria for the shared libraries such as to provide a higher customer support for a library that has a high priority level as opposed to the one that is assigned a lower priority level. The provider uses the support criteria for shared libraries to address its customers requests based on their changing needs and thus to provide better customer services. Further for example the provider may choose to collect fees from its customers based on the support criteria they enjoy for the shared libraries used by their third party software programs. As will be discussed throughout this document the provider here refers to a company or organization responsible for creating and providing the base operating system the shared libraries and local software programs while a customer or third party refers to a company or organization responsible for generating and providing the third party software programs. Further shared libraries and the related interfaces e.g. ABI API may be accessed and used by one or more third party software programs as well as by one or more local software programs that are part of the operating system and independent of the one or more third party software programs. ABI and or API refer to and may include data identifying ABIs and or APIs such as those providing identifying names locations IDs versions etc. The user refers to a computer programmer or system administrator associated with the provider.

In one embodiment host machine employs ABI API management mechanism ABI API mechanism to manage ABIs and APIs and their associated metadata such as the metadata that describes which shared library provides which ABI and or API and of what version along with identifying those Executable and Linkable Format ELF binary files that consume them. ABI API mechanism detects and extracts the ABI API metadata and stores it in a database . The ABI API metadata in one embodiment includes ABI API provisioning detail and ABI API usage detail as will be described later in this document. The ABI API provisioning detail for example includes the number of ABIs and or APIs associated with each shared library for various local software programs the known use of such ABIs and APIs various library or operating system functions associated with each ABI API and the importance of each of those operating system functions etc. On example of ABI API provisioning detail includes a prominent shared library like glibc libc.so.6 that provides an ABI strcmp which can be found in several applications and thus can be significantly important due to its high use frequency. The ABI API usage detail in one embodiment includes the usage detail of each ABI and or API and its associated shared library as it relates to each of the third party software programs . For example depending on the importance of a library or operating system function e.g. something as simple as printing deleting etc. to a third party software program an ABI and or API associated with that operating function is expected to be frequently accessed and used by that third party software program hence indicating the usage and thus the importance of the ABI and or API and its associated shared library . Further shared libraries and the related interfaces e.g. ABI API may be accessed and used by one or more third party software programs as well as by one or more local software programs e.g. including but not limited to local software programs that are part of and or provided by the same host or provider that provided the operating system and independent of the one or more third party software programs . As aforementioned ABI and or API refer to and may include data identifying ABIs and or APIs such as those providing identifying names locations IDs versions etc.

The database includes a storage device that is either employed on the host machine or remotely located on another machine that is in communication with the host machine . In one embodiment ABI API provisioning and usage details are then compared and analyzed by the ABI API mechanism to determine priority levels of various shared libraries . These priority levels may then be used by the provider e.g. organization or company that creates and or provides the operating system the shared libraries the local software program etc. to establish support criteria for the shared libraries such as to provide better customer support criteria for a shared library that has a high priority level as opposed to the one that is assigned a lower priority level to address and satisfy its customers changing requests and needs. Shared libraries refer to those libraries that are accessed and used by both the local and third party software programs to perform various operating system or library functions e.g. reading files writing files file management network communications inter process communications memory management string manipulations user interface manipulations mathematics functions etc. .

As is known in the art a library is a collection of classes and subroutines that are used to develop and support software programs such as representing code and data that provide services to both local and other independent software programs . For example an operating system provides shared libraries to implement aforementioned system functions that are used by various local and third party software programs . Other libraries may be provided by and specific to third party software programs created and provided by third party providers e.g. a third party software development company or organization other than the provider responsible for creating and providing the operating system and the shared libraries .

Each library provides a collection or group of ABIs. An ABI represents a compiled binary form of a function serving as a low level interface between software programs and the operating system . When a function is broken such as a print function e.g. when a print command executes double prints or does not print the entire text e.g. prints hell when asked to print hello etc. the broken function indicates a possible problem with the corresponding ABI and the associated library. In one embodiment an ABI may include details relating to data types sizes alignments calling conventions symbol versions system call numbers binary format of object files etc. An API refers to a library including routines to call data structures to manipulate and or object classes to use etc. Although ABI and API are referenced together as ABI API throughout this document it is contemplated that the ABI API mechanism may be used with ABIs and or APIs as necessitated or desired.

As aforementioned a third party or customer software program represents a software program that is developed by someone other than the provider that produces the operating system and the shared libraries . For example a third party software program may include a special purpose software program that is used for or by an organization e.g. media development software for media companies specialized modeling software etc. and like a local software program accesses and uses any number of shared libraries to utilize system functions.

In one embodiment ABI API extractor finds and extracts ABIs and or APIs associated with various operating system functions associated with and provided by the shared libraries . ABIs and APIs may generally refer to data identifying names locations IDs versions etc. ABI API extractor in one embodiment using for example a library controller or installer scans through the base operating system the local software programs and the shared libraries to find and extract their ABIs and or APIs and any metadata associated with them. Metadata may refer to various versions of any given ABI API and or library and where they come from such as ndx value bind value whether they are internal or not type of ABI API library etc. These extracted ABIs and or APIs and the associated metadata are organized as ABI API provisioning detail and stored in the database .

Similarly in one embodiment ABI API usage detector detects the use of various shared libraries by third party software programs . For example ABI API detector checks the various ABIs and or APIs associated with various system functions that are important to the third party software programs or monitors the access and use of relevant ABIs and or API that are accessed and used by the third party software programs to perform the important system functions. The information can then be used to determine which of the shared libraries are important e.g. frequently accessed or used to the third party software programs . Once the ABI API usage detail is detected it is then stored in the database . In one embodiment the importance of a shared library depends on the usage frequency of an ABI API based on its association with a library or operating system function. For example if a third party software program is known for printing documents then that third party software program is expected to use a particular library function that relates to printing e.g. print library function with a greater frequency than many of the other library functions and even more than by some of the other third party software programs . The aforementioned monitoring of the ABIs APIs can tell us the important of a particular ABI API such as in this example an ABI API that is associated with a shared library that relates to the print library function. Similarly the use of other library or operating system functions and consequently the use of their associated ABIs APIs can be monitored and from the monitoring data the importance of such ABIs APIs can be determined for example the higher the usage of an ABI API the higher the importance of a shared library associated with that ABI API and vice versa. In one embodiment the aforementioned monitoring of ABIs and or APIs may be performed by scanning a software code of the local and or third party software programs or in real time while executing the local and or third party software programs . One example of a monitoring technique includes keeping the usage detail of ABIs APIs by a local or third party software and adding a new software into a list to check after regular intervals whether they are still using the same ABI API or not. Further an in between check is performed to determine whether there is any breakage in the ABI API.

In one embodiment a comparison module compares the ABI API provisioning detail with the ABI API usage detail to determine the importance level of each shard library as it relates to one or more system functions that are important to and used by one or more of the third party software programs . For example of the shared libraries those shared libraries that relate to those library functions that are more frequently used by various third party software programs are regarded as more important than those shared libraries that are associated with those library functions that are less frequently used or not used at all by the third party software programs . Although it is not necessary that an important threshold be assigned to a shared library in one embodiment a user may set one or more threshold levels to classify importance of shared libraries . For example a first shared library that is used more than 200 times by any of the third party software programs and or by more than 5 third party software programs may be regarded as extremely important while a second shared library that is used 150 199 times and or by 4 third party software programs may be classified as important and similarly a third shared library that is used 100 149 times and or by 3 third party software programs may be regarded as moderately important and so forth. It is contemplated that these classifications or threshold levels as well as other factors e.g. customer history customer needs etc. may be taken into consideration when forming support criteria for shared libraries . In one embodiment the comparison of the ABI API provisioning detail with the ABI API usage detail points out the importance of each shared library based on its access and use by one or more of the third party software programs as represented by an ABI and or API corresponding to a system function . The comparison results are stored in the database . It is contemplated that a particular third party software program may provide various libraries that are exclusive to the execution of that particular third party software program and may be part of a greater set of libraries but remain irrelevant to the shared libraries .

An analysis module in one embodiment analyzes the comparison results obtained from the ABI API provisioning and usage details comparison performed by the comparison module . The analysis of the comparison results includes the analysis module assigning a priority level to each shared library according to its importance level gathered from the comparison results. For example the higher the importance of a shared library according to the comparison results the higher the priority level assigned to it by the analysis module . Further in one embodiment the analysis module includes intelligence and decision making component to recommend support criteria policies for the shared libraries based on their assigned priority levels as well as one or more of user defined predetermined criteria customer requests customer history system bandwidth and or third party software program usage history etc. For example using these recommended support criteria policies the provider may decide to establish an extensive support criteria for those shared libraries that are identified as being frequently used such as used by five or more of the third party software programs while establish a somewhat lesser support criteria for other less popular shared libraries or the like. Further for example certain large and often used libraries e.g. glibc are known to be important but using the ABI API mechanism even a relatively small and rarely used library e.g. lib.b.2 libfreedom etc. may also be determined to be important for example to a particular customer based on its third party software program s use of that small library. Thus having known the importance of this library in one embodiment the provider may choose to establish appropriate support criteria relevant to this library that is customized for the particular customer.

Method starts at block with finding and extracting of ABIs and APIs and their associated metadata by an ABI API extractor. This ABI API provisioning detail is then saved in a database at block . At block usage detail of various ABIs and APIs associated with shared libraries as determined from their use by third party software programs is detected. At block this ABI API usage detail is stored at the database. At block in one embodiment the ABI API usage detail is compared with the ABI API provisioning detail to determine the importance level of each shared library based for example on the frequency by with a shared library is accessed and used by any number of third party software programs. ABIs and APIs may generally refer to data identifying names locations IDs versions etc. At block these comparison results are stored in the database.

At block the comparison results are analyzed. These analyses include assigning a priority level to each shared library based on its determined importance level as set forth in the comparison results. As discussed previously for example a shared library may be assigned high importance if it is accessed and used by a large number of third party software programs or frequently accessed and used by only a small number of third party software programs. Further importance and priority level may be directly proportional to each other for example the higher the importance of a shared library the higher the priority level assigned to it.

At block based on the analysis of the comparison results support criteria policy recommendations may be provided to the provider. These support criteria policy recommendations may consider other relevant but optional factors such as user defined predetermined conditions customer requests customer history system bandwidth and or third party software program usage history etc. Based on these policy recommendations and other relevant factors e.g. customer loyalty future anticipated use of a shared library etc. the provider may form and provide to its customers appropriate support criteria for each of the shared libraries at block .
