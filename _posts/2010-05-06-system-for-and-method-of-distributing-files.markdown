As networks became widespread people saw it as a way of distributing data. But while the average bandwidth capacity is increasing users around the world are trying to share more data. Although the networks are able to support more bandwidth they cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing requests of the users. Some of the network configurations are not always suitable for disseminating files of considerable size. Often networks have to be managed in a very automatic dynamic and efficient way. For example enabling distribution of files may require flexible control distributed processing bandwidth sensitivity conditional processing auditing and security.

An exemplary embodiment provides a system and a process for distributing data to a plurality of work stations via a communication network. For example the plurality of work stations may be coupled to a data distribution system via the communication network. The data distribution system may distribute data e.g. application files to the plurality of work stations via the communication network. In an exemplary embodiment the data distribution system may distribute data to one work station of the plurality of work stations at a time in order to ensure sufficient bandwidth and processing power for other applications.

For example the data distribution system may distribute data to the plurality of work stations sequentially one work station at a time.

The data distribution system may also maintain a data request database for storing data requests transmitted from the plurality of work stations. In an exemplary embodiment during a data distribution process a work station may transmit a data request to the data distribution system. The data distribution system may store the data request from the work station in the data request database for later processing.

The one or more data probing requests may include data identifier information associated with data maintained at the data distribution system . The plurality of work stations N may process the one or more data probing requests. For example the work station may compare data maintained at the data distribution system based on the data probing requests with data maintained at the work station . The work station may include data identifier information associated with data maintained at the data distribution system and not at the work station into the data probing requests. Subsequently the plurality of work stations N may transmit the one or more processed data probing requests back to the data distribution system .

In another exemplary embodiment the work station may include data identifier information associated with data maintained at the work station to the one or more data probing requests. The work station may transmit the one or more data probing requests back to the data distribution system . The data distribution system may determine whether data maintained at the plurality of work stations N require update based at least in part on the one or more processed data probing requests. For example the data distribution system may determine whether the work station maintained the most recent data by comparing the data maintained at the work station with data stored in the data distribution system based on the data identifier information associated with data maintained at the work station . After receiving data distribution requests the method may proceed to block .

At block the data distribution system may store the data distribution requests. For example the data distribution system may store the data distribution requests in a data request queue database. The data distribution system may initiate a data distribution session based at least in part on the data distribution requests received from a plurality of work stations N .
