title: Domain based workflows
abstract: Technology is disclosed for using workflows based on domains in a hierarchical data structure (e.g. LDAP directory) or other type of data structure. When a workflow is created, it is associated with domain. The domain is defined by a selected node and all nodes below that selected node in the hierarchical data structure. At run time, the system identifies which workflows perform a requested task and are associated with a domain that includes the target of the task. If multiple workflows are determined, the user is provided with the ability to choose one of the identified workflows for performing the tasks.
