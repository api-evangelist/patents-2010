The present invention relates to a polyester for a toner usable in development or the like of latent images formed in for example electrophotography an electrostatic recording method an electrostatic printing method or the like a resin binder for a toner containing the polyester and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.

In recent years with the advancements in speed up and energy conservation of the machines toners having excellent low temperature fixing ability and hot offset resistance are in demand.

Patent Publication 1 discloses as an objective of providing a toner which is excellent in all of low temperature fixing ability offset resistance pulverizability dispersibility of an internal additive and storage property a toner containing as resin binders a polyester resin A and a polyester resin B having a softening point calculated from the softening point of the polyester resin A plus 10 C. or more wherein the above polyester resin A is a resin having a polyester unit obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing 1 2 propanediol in an amount of 65 by mol of the dihydric alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component containing a meth acrylic acid modified rosin and wherein the above polyester resin B is a resin having a polyester unit obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing 1 2 propanediol and 1 3 propanediol in a total amount of 70 by mol or more of the dihydric alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component containing a purified resin.

Patent Publication 2 discloses as an objective of providing a toner having degradability which has excellent fixing ability fixing strength offset resistance and blocking resistance a toner for electrostatic image development characterized in that the toner contains a polyester resin obtained by subjecting a composition containing lactic acid and a hydroxycarboxylic acid having three or more functional groups to a dehydration polycondensation and a colorant.

However in the patent publications mentioned above all of low temperature fixing ability hot offset resistance and durability cannot be satisfied.

The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography having excellent durability in addition to low temperature fixing ability and hot offset resistance a polyester for a toner usable in the toner and a resin binder for a toner.

an aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid compound having a total number of hydroxy group or groups and carboxyl group or groups of 4 or more 

an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having a hydroxyl group bound to a secondary carbon atom in an amount of 50 by mol or more and

wherein the aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid compound and the aliphatic diol having a hydroxyl group bound to a secondary carbon atom are in a molar ratio i.e. the aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid compound the aliphatic diol having a hydroxyl group bound to a secondary carbon atom of from 0.05 to 0.8 2 a resin binder for a toner containing the polyester for a toner as defined in the above 1 and 3 a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder as defined in the above 2 .

The fixing device of a copy machine AR 505 manufactured by Sharp Corporation was modified so that fixing could be carried out outside the machine. While sequentially raising the temperature of a fixing roller from 100 to 240 C. in an increment of 10 C. the unfixed images obtained were subjected to a fixing test at each temperature with a fixing device fixing speed 390 mm sec adjusted so that a total fixing pressure was 40 kgf. UNICEF Cellophane tape MITSUBISHI PENCIL CO. LTD. width 18 mm JIS Z 1522 was adhered to the fixed images and the resulting fixed images were allowed to pass through a fixing roller set at 30 C. and the tape was then removed. The optical reflective densities of the image before adhesion of the tape and after removal of the tape were measured with a reflective densitometer RD 915 manufactured by Macbeth Process Measurements Co. . The temperature of a fixing roller at which the ratio of the optical reflective densities after removal of the tape before adhesion of the tape initially exceeds 90 is defined as the lowest fixing temperature. The low temperature fixing ability was evaluated according to the following evaluation criteria. The results are shown in Table 5. Here the paper used in the fixing test was CopyBond SF 70NA 75 g m manufactured by Sharp Corporation.

In Test Example 1 a temperature at which offset was initially confirmed was visually judged upon sequentially raising a temperature of a fixing roller from 90 to 240 C. and hot offset resistance was evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The results are shown in Table 5.

A toner was loaded to a printer PAGEPRESTO N 4 manufactured by CASIO COMPUTER CO. LTD. fixing contact fixing method development method nonmagnetic monocomponent development method diameter of developer roller 2.3 cm and printing was conducted continuously on obliquely striped patterns having a print coverage of 5.5 under the environmental conditions of 32 C. and humidity of 85 . During the course of printing black solid images were printed for every 500 sheets and the presence or absence of the lines on the formed images was confirmed. At the point where the generation of the lines was observed printing was stopped and the test was conducted up to 5 000 sheets at the maximum. Durability was evaluated by defining the number of printed sheets at the point where the generation of lines was visually observed on the images as the number of sheets at which lines were generated by fusion or fixing of toner on a developer roller in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. In other words it can be judged that the larger the number of sheets without generation of lines the higher the durability of toner. The results are shown in Table 5.

It can be seen from the above results that Examples 1 to 11 are excellent in all of low temperature fixing ability hot offset resistance and durability as compared to Comparative Examples 1 to 6 in which a polyester without using an aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid compound is contained as a resin binder.

The polyester for a toner of the present invention is suitably used as a resin binder of a toner usable in development or the like of latent images formed in for example electrophotography electrostatic recording method electrostatic printing method or the like.
