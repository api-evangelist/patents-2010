title: Systems and methods for authenticating a user for accessing account information using a web-enabled device
abstract: Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for authenticating and efficiently re-authenticating a user with a financial institution in order to gain access to account information using a web-enabled device. The web-enabled device stores user profiles associated with the user including authentication information provided by the user during primary authentication. The device retrieves the authentication information upon secondary authentication, that is, validation of the user's identity, which in some embodiments, includes local validation of a personal identification number (“PIN”) and/or a remote control passcode (“RCP”). As such, the web-enabled device re-authenticates the user without requiring authentication communication with a financial institution server, and thereafter, the user interacts with an application running on the web-enabled device to retrieve desired account information from the financial institution server.

In general embodiments herein disclosed relate to systems methods and computer program products for authenticating users for access to account information and more specifically re authenticating users using locally stored authentication information for granting access to account information via a web enabled device such as a set top box a gaming console a web enabled television a vehicle web enabled display or the like.

Currently online and mobile banking provides financial institution customers the ability to access account information such as account balances transfer information recurring payment information and the like via personal computers or other computing devices capable of connecting with the financial institution servers over the Internet. However customers could often use account information in situations where a conventional computing device is unavailable or does not have access to the Internet. Even in circumstances where conventional computing devices such as personal or laptop computers are available it may be more convenient for a customer to use another device such as a web enabled television to access account information if possible.

Furthermore customers increasingly appreciate communication of desired information as quickly as possible. For example a customer watching a television show who desires to know his or her checking account balance has several avenues for learning the balance including booting a laptop computer waiting for the laptop computer to resolve a connection to the customer s wireless router for connecting to the Internet. Once the laptop has connected to the Internet the customer must start a web browser and navigate to the financial institution s website. Thereafter the customer must go through the authentication process which typically requires entry of a username and a password. Some financial institutions use different systems for additional security such as a web based authentication system for example SiteKey or the like which provides additional layers of mutual authentication between the customer and the financial institution s servers as discussed in further detail below. Once the user is fully authenticated and a secure transaction portal is established providing security around communicated information the financial institution server communicates the information desired by the customer who reads the information on the laptop. Such a process can take several minutes and in fact depending on various factors could take ten or fifteen minutes. A system requiring such a waiting period fails to satisfy a customer needing immediate communication of account information.

Therefore a need exists to develop methods systems computer program products and the like which provide for re authentication of a user using common web enabled devices such as web enabled televisions set top boxes gaming consoles and the like based on locally stored user profiles.

As illustrated in the web enabled device and the financial institution server are in network communication via the Internet although other public and or private intranets may also be implemented in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. The web enabled device includes secure computing platform having a processor and a memory . As previously noted the secure nature of computing platform dictates that the information communicated from the web enabled device specifically authentication information communicated from the web enabled device to the financial institution server and account information communicated from the financial institution server to the web enabled device is secure.

Further the memory of secure computing platform includes financial institution service application . The financial institution service application is operable for establishing a secure connection with the financial institution server to deliver account information to the user of the web enabled device . In various embodiments account information includes but is not limited to account current and available balances transaction information such as information regarding pending transactions and scheduled future transactions information concerning posted transactions such as date transaction type check number if applicable description of transaction and debit or credit amount customer information such as contact address phone and e mail and other information related to the customer s one or more accounts maintained by the financial institution. In addition from a business perspective the web enabled device may be in communication with a digital cash drawer card UPC scanner or the like which are not depicted in and thus the web enabled device may function as a point of sale device. The financial institution service application includes code and is specifically configured for the web enabled device on which it is implemented. Financial institution service application includes one or more locally stored user profiles . The local user profiles are collections of information corresponding to one or more customers who use the web enabled device .

In some embodiments the customer submits authentication information such as a username password and in some embodiments a chosen image and accompanying phrase used for authenticating the customer with the financial institution server . Once the customer has been authenticated with the financial institution server the web enabled device stores the customer s positive authentication for a predetermined period of time for example one week or one month. In some embodiments the web enabled device establishes a PIN for the customer to enter the next time the customer requires access to account information. The web enabled device simply requests the username and PIN the next time the customer desires account information. In this regard in some embodiments when the customer requires authentication subsequent to being authenticated a first time the authentication is performed locally to the web enabled device . This secondary authentication typically does not go through a more complicated process including secure communication with the financial institution server .

In the illustrated embodiment the financial institution server also includes a secure computing platform having a processor and memory . Memory includes a financial institution account module operable for providing a secure connection to the web enabled device and delivering account information to the web enabled device . Memory also includes server user profiles that include collections of information corresponding to one or more customers having accounts maintained by the financial institution.

In some embodiments the server user profiles include some or all of the information contained in one or more corresponding local user profiles . And in yet other embodiments the server user profiles are updated or changed concurrently or soon after changes are made to the corresponding local user profiles and in other embodiments the server user profiles are not updated based on changes to the local user profiles or are changed some time after changes are made to the local user profiles . The server user profiles in some embodiments were populated with information before the local user profiles and are used as a basis for populating the local user profiles with information.

Referring now to a block diagram illustrating a more detailed depiction of one embodiment of the web enabled device is shown. In addition to providing greater detail highlights various alternate embodiments of the present invention. The web enabled device includes in various embodiments different types of computerized communication devices capable of providing a platform for the financial institution service application and establishing a secure network connection with the financial institution server on behalf of the financial institution service application .

The web enabled device includes a secure computing platform configured for transmitting data across a wired and or wireless network and receiving and executing routines and applications. Secure computing platform includes memory which includes but is not limited to in various embodiments one or more of the following volatile and non volatile memory such as read only and or random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. Further memory includes in various embodiments one or more flash memory cells or in other embodiments includes a secondary or tertiary storage device such as magnetic media optical media tape or soft or hard disk.

Further secure computing platform also includes processor which in some embodiments is an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor logic circuit or other data processing device. Processor or another processor such as an ASIC may execute an application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs such as financial institution service application stored in the memory of the web enabled device . API is typically a runtime environment executing on the web based device and operable to control the execution of applications on the web enabled device .

Processor includes various processing subsystems embodied in hardware firmware software and combinations thereof that enable the functionality of web enabled device and the operability of the device on the wired or wireless network. For example processing subsystems allow for initiating and maintaining communications and exchanging data with other networked devices. For example processor may additionally include one or a combination of processing subsystems such as but not limited to sound non volatile memory file system transmit receive searcher layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 main control remote procedure digital signal processor Bluetooth system Bluetooth user interface security authentication graphics USB multimedia such as MPEG GPRS etc all of which are not individually depicted in for the sake of clarity .

Secure computing platform additionally includes communications module embodied in hardware firmware software and combinations thereof that enables communications among the various components of the web enabled device as well as between the web enabled device and the network. In described embodiments the communications module enables the communication of all correspondence between web enabled device and other wired or wireless devices. Thus communications module in some embodiments includes the requisite hardware firmware software and or combinations thereof for establishing a wired or wireless network communication connection.

As previously noted in regards to the memory of secure computing platform includes financial institution service application . The financial institution service application is configured for establishing a secure connection with the financial institution server to deliver authentication information to the financial institution server and to receive account information from the financial institution server . The financial institution service application is configured with code and is specifically configured for the web enabled device platform on which it is implemented. For example in an embodiment where the web enabled device is a gaming console or any other device that communicates with a signed application certificate bi directional application and financial institution server authentication are conducted by exchanging digital certificates between the application and the financial institution server. In addition to exchange of the digital certificates further authentication of the web enabled device is provided by communicating a web enabled device identifier that is stored in memory and accessible by API for communication to the financial institution server via communications module . The web enabled device identifier is communicated as plaintext or in certain embodiments the web enabled device identifier is encrypted or otherwise encoded prior to communication to prevent the identifier from being intercepted during communication.

In addition the financial institution service application can deliver user interfaces for the financial institution service that are unique to the web enabled device platform. The user interfaces may provide for the user customer to conduct transactions and the like using input mechanisms that are unique to the particular web enabled device being used. For example a game pad or gaming controller provides for multiple action buttons as opposed to the two buttons configured on a conventional mouse input device for a PC. In addition the user interface may rely on motion detection in the game controller for inputs to the user interface or other user inputs related to special purpose controllers or the like. In this regard the overall user experience with the financial institution service is enhanced by providing more interactivity and the like than would be provided by a conventional PC platform.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the memory includes a user authentication module that is configured to provide user authentication prior to granting the user authorization to access account information. The user authentication module may include a gaming console specific user authentication routine configured to provide user authentication based on pre determined user designated inputs to input mechanisms that are specific to the web enabled device .

For example certain remote controls and game controllers include an accelerometer or other mechanisms for detecting motion in the input mechanism. As such the user may designate a certain predetermined remote control passcode RCP for purposes of authentication. In some embodiments the RCP is also a series of keystrokes or button presses such as for example button A button C button B . The RCP in some embodiments includes a motion input corresponding to a plurality of vectors for example three dimensional vectors representing x y and z coordinates and a vector representing time. Once the motion input is received the vectors may be converted to a numeric value encrypted into a password and optionally hashed prior to communicating the password to a network entity for authentication purposes. Such motions would characteristically be harder to intercept or replicate and would be easier for the user to remember than conventional alpha numeric passwords.

In another example the input mechanism is a conventional gamepad also referred to in the art as a joypad. The gamepad can have anywhere from two input buttons keypads up to a dozen or more combined with multiple omnidirectional analogue or digital control sticks. In such input devices the user may designate a predetermined PIN which in various embodiments is a series or pattern of multiple inputs to the various buttons control sticks and the like configured on the remote control gamepad or other entry device. In some embodiments the PIN is an alphanumeric chain of characters such as a four digit numeric code. In other embodiments the PIN is or includes an RCP as discussed in further detail below.

In another example the input mechanism is a special purpose game controller such as a dance pad or other mechanism that provides for inputs based on feet movement to designated areas on the pad. In such input mechanisms the user designated predetermined PIN includes a series or pattern of multiple inputs to the various areas on the pad e.g. a dance step or routine . In another example the input mechanism is any other special purpose input device such as a steering wheel or a light gun and the user designated predetermined PIN is a series or pattern of one or more inputs to the specific special purpose input device. According to one embodiment of the invention user authentication routine is configured to store and accept a different user input action for each input mechanism such that the user can provide the predetermined input motion to the device depending upon which device or devices are currently connected to the web enabled device .

In another example the input mechanism is a touch screen or the like and the user designated predetermined PIN includes a series or pattern of various inputs to the touch screen display such as movement of objects on the display or a series pattern of taps to the display.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates a method for authenticating a customer with a financial institution server and communicating account information to the customer using a web enabled device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At step a financial institution service application is loaded onto a web enabled device . The financial institution service application in some embodiments is obtained from the financial institution in a tangible form such as Compact Disc CD or the like loaded onto the web enabled device by inserting the CD in a portable media drive and saving the application in device memory . In alternate embodiments the financial institution service application is downloaded from a financial institution networked site such as a public website or the like and stored on the web enabled device s memory . As previously mentioned the financial institution service application in some embodiments is associated with one or more financial institutions such as a commercial bank brokerage firm lending firm or the like. The financial institution service application provides for establishing a secured network connection to the associated financial institution for delivery of authentication information verification of authentication and communication of account information. As indicated above the account information in various embodiments includes but is not limited to account current and available balances transaction information such as information regarding pending transaction and scheduled future transactions information concerning posted transactions such as date transaction type check number if applicable description of transaction and debit or credit amount customer information such as contact address phone and e mail and other information related to the customer s one or more accounts maintained by the financial institution and the like.

At step the financial institution service application is launched on the web enabled device . An indication for launching the financial institution service application in some embodiments is based on user input to an input mechanism such as a remote control game controller or the like. In other embodiments the financial institution service application is configured for launching at or proximate the boot up power up of the web enabled device .

At step the financial institution service application establishes a connection with the financial institution server . In some embodiments the connection is secured using bi directional digital certificate exchange between the application and the financial institution server . In addition to digital certificate exchange for the purpose of verifying both the application at the financial institution server and the financial institution server at the application the web enabled device in some embodiments is configured to communicate a hardware identifier to the financial institution server for the purpose of verifying the web enabled device at the financial institution server as briefly discussed above regarding the web enabled device identifier .

In some embodiments the connection between the web enabled device and the financial institution server is secured by encrypting the communications between the two. In various embodiments different encryption routines are used and in those various embodiments the encryption routine may be a secret private key encryption routine such as a block cipher routine implementing an XOR function or a more detailed secret key encryption algorithm such as Data Encryption Standard DES Triple DES 3DES DESX Advanced Encryption Standard AES CAST 128 CAST 256 International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Rivest Ciphers 1 6 RC1 RC 6 Blowfish Twofish Camellia MISTY1 Secure And Fast Encryption Routine SAFER KASUMI SEED Skipjack or any other suitable private key encryption routine. Additionally a public key encryption routine may be used in some embodiments to encrypt the numeric value in the authentication process. The public key encryption routine may be but is not limited to RSA Diffie Hellman Digital Signature Algorithm DSA ElGamel Elliptical Curve Crptography ECC Public Key Crytography Standards PKCS Cramer Shoup Key Exchange Algorithm KEA LUC or the like. In some embodiments the user s password discussed below is hashed prior to communication to a network entity to provide for further security. The hash function is applied to ensure that the password is not intercepted during communication and serves as a digital fingerprint to ensure that the password has not been altered by an intruder or virus.

At step once the network connection has been established the user is authenticated as a means of authorizing the user to receive and in some embodiments edit the account information. User authentication allows the user to provide authentication credentials generally in the form of a password or passcode which are securely validated by the financial institution. According to one embodiment of the invention the user authentication credentials are defined by web enabled device specific user inputs such as a predetermined set of keystrokes provided on the input mechanism such as a remote control or gamepad. In some embodiments of the web enabled device motion provided to a motion detecting input mechanism or other predetermined inputs provided to a joypad or any other special purpose input mechanism .

In different embodiments of the invention various authentication methods and systems are used. For example in one embodiment a configuration of the SiteKey system is used. SiteKey is a web based security system that provides one type of mutual authentication between users and websites or institution servers such as the financial institution server . The SiteKey system had been owned by RSA Data Security which is the security division of EMC Corporation and is headquartered in Bedford Mass. but the SiteKey registered trademark is owned by Bank of America Corporation of Charlotte N.C. the assignee of the present invention. The first step in SiteKey authentication is the user identifies him or herself to the authenticating entity which is in this case the financial institution server . The user s identity in most embodiments takes the form of a username or alias. If the authenticating entity determines a valid username or alias has been entered by the user then the process proceeds. If not the user is either asked to enter the username again or is blocked from entering additional usernames. The next step involves the authenticating entity authenticating itself to the user. This is typically accomplished by the authenticating entity displaying an image and or an accompanying phrase that was previously chosen by the user and stored by the authenticating entity. If the user does not recognize the image and or an accompanying phrase the user should assume the entity in communication is not the actual account provider but rather a phishing website or other nefarious entity. As such should the user not recognize the image and or the accompanying phrase the user should immediately abandon the interaction without entering any additional information. If the user does recognize the image and or the accompanying phrase the user may deem the entity authentic and proceed. Typically the next step is for the user to enter a password that is associated with the previously entered username. If the password does not match the username entered the authenticating entity in some embodiments begins the entire process again and in others prevents additional tries to authenticate. If the password matches the entered username the authenticating entity validates the user and confirms the user s validation by communicating the validation to the web enabled device .

Accordingly at step based on the authentication process the web enabled device receives confirmation of the validation of the user authorization and in some embodiments communicates the successful authentication to the user through the display device . Once validation of authentication has been received at the web enabled device the web enabled device creates a PIN associated with the user step . In other embodiments the financial institution server creates the PIN and communicates the PIN to the web enabled device and in yet other embodiments the web enabled device allows the user to choose an appropriate PIN and the device receives the user s input regarding PIN using the input mechanism . In some of those embodiments the user is asked to enter the PIN more than once to ensure that the captured PIN corresponds with the user s intended PIN. Once the web enabled device is satisfied with the user s PIN entry or the PIN has been created the PIN is locally stored step . This stored PIN is referred to herein as an initial PIN. Similarly in embodiments where an RCP is created or input by a user the RCP is referred to herein as an initial RCP. In other embodiments the PIN is locally stored along with the authentication information provided by the user such as the username and password and in others only the authentication information is locally stored. In most embodiments the authentication information and or the PIN are locally stored in the memory in a local user profile associated with one or more users. For example in one embodiment after the user has been authenticated using the SiteKey system discussed above including entering a username and an associated password the user is prompted to enter a PIN twice. After the PIN has been accepted the web enabled device stores both the PIN and the authentication information including the username and password in a local user profile associated with the user. In addition in some embodiments the validation received from the financial institution server see step is stored along with the authentication information in the local user profile of the memory .

At step the user conducts one or more account information transactions. For example in one embodiment the user chooses an accounts tab displayed in conjunction with the financial institution service application running on the web enabled device and visualized on the display device . Once the user has chosen the accounts tab the user s account summaries are displayed for example checking savings investment and credit card account identification and balance information is displayed. The user can then choose a particular account to retrieve additional related account information. For example the user can choose a particular checking account or savings account and thereafter choose one or more pieces of account information for additional more detailed information. In one embodiment the application displays a listing of cleared and or pending transactions with interactive transaction information such as clickable selectable transaction identifiers which when chosen retrieve additional information concerning a particular transaction. For example if the user chooses a check deposit choosing the application in one embodiment provides a hyperlink leading to an image of the deposited check. In other embodiments various other pieces of account information and transaction information are displayed such as for example transaction amount data and type of transaction.

In another embodiment conducting transactions is based on inputs from accessories devices applications which are in communication with the web enabled device . The accessories may include but are not limited to a card scanner a cash drawer a UPC scanner or the like. In this regard the business user can use the web enabled device as a point of sale terminal enabling cash services via the web enabled device and or back end financial transactions conducted by the financial institution via the secure session established between the application and financial institution server s .

Generally steps through and and in various embodiments other method steps are termed primary authentication for the user. In some embodiments the user retains this primary authentication that is authentication requiring validation from the financial institution server for a predetermined finite period of time. In such a configuration the user will not be required to re enter authentication information such as a password for a predetermined period of time. Rather once method has been executed including receiving validation of the authentication from the financial institution see step and locally storing the user s authentication information in a user profile see step the user will not need to re enter authentication information for a predetermined period of time. The predetermined period of time being for example a day a few days one week two weeks one month or some other predetermined period of time set as a constant or variable and stored within the financial institution service application and the financial institution account module . The user for example once authenticated via method can efficiently access account information using the financial institution service application running on the web enabled device . In some embodiments however the user will be required to provide secondary authentication that is validation of the user s identity before accessing account information in addition to the primary authentication of process . In some embodiments as discussed below in detail with reference to such secondary authentication typically involves inputting a predetermined PIN or RCP see steps and for creating and storing the PIN . Once the PIN or RCP is authenticated or validation of authentication is received at the device see step for local authentication of step for remote authentication and step for receiving validation of the user via the web enabled device can access account information. In other embodiments discussed below with reference to the user s secondary authentication is processed automatically that is without requiring action by the user such as the need to enter a PIN by use of a pre approved personal mobile device in wireless communication with the web enabled device.

Referring now to a method is illustrated for providing secondary authentication or re authenticating the customer using retained authentication information stored in one or more user profiles according to one embodiment of the present invention. At step user authentication information is retrieved from one or more user profiles stored locally in the memory . Step is initiated when the user prompts the web enabled device to provide account information. For example in one embodiment the user chooses a widget or application running in the background of the display using the input mechanism . The user provides identity information which is information tending to identify the user. Examples of identity information include but are not limited to the user s actual name a username associated with the user a PIN and or a RCP. The PIN and or RCP received from the user during this secondary authentication process is referred to herein as a current PIN and or a current RCP. The current PIN current RCP is the user s input when the user is prompted by the system for the user s PIN RCP which was created input to the system and stored during method . As discussed above the PIN RCP stored in the system is referred to as the initial PIN and or initial RCP and is typically identical to the current PIN current RCP input by the user unless the user incorrectly enters his or her PIN or in the case where the user is someone without access to the account. The user s identity information is received by the input mechanism step and the web enabled device authenticates the received identity information locally thereby verifying the identity of the user step . Locally refers to using the processor without communicating the authentication information across the Internet to the financial institution server for authentication. At step if the user is authenticated the web enabled device communicates the validation of the user authentication to the financial institution server . As such the financial institution server becomes aware that the user has been authenticated for an account information communication session and at step the web enabled device facilitates the user conducting one or more account information transactions such as those discussed at length above.

Referring now to a method is illustrated for providing secondary authentication or re authenticating the customer using retained authentication information stored in one or more user profiles according to another embodiment of the present invention. At step the user authentication information is retrieved from one or more user profiles associated with the user. Step is initiated upon prompting by the user to access account information. As discussed above with reference to the financial institution service application is typically running in the background of other actively displayed content on the display . However the user can choose the application or maximize the application for interaction with the application as desired. Once the user indicates to the web enabled device the user s identification information the web enabled device receives the identification information step and communicates the authentication information to the financial institution server step . In some embodiments the authentication information communicated to the financial institution server includes the identification information and in other embodiments it does not. In some embodiments the financial institution server re authenticates the user by verifying the identity of the user using the latest authentication information provided by the user step . Next validation of the user authentication is received from the financial institution server step . Finally once the user is authenticated one or more account information transactions are conducted step .

The method illustrated in is an alternative method to the method illustrated in . Method involves local authentication of the user at the web enabled device based on minimal user input such as a username PIN and or RCP which are compared to authentication information stored in one or more local user profiles stored in the local memory . Accordingly communication with the financial institution server need not occur until validation of the authentication is sent from the web enabled device to the financial institution server . On the other hand method involves remote authentication of the user at the financial institution server . Remote refers to a process or processes occurring at a location separate and independent from the web enabled device. Method is also based on minimal user identity information input such as a username PIN and or RCP however method involves communicating the user s authentication information from the web enabled device to the financial institution server . In various other embodiments a combination of the local authentication of method and the remote authentication of method are used. For example in one embodiment the user s PIN is authenticated locally but the username and password retrieved from the user profile is communicated to the server for additional authentication. Another example in another embodiment involves local PIN authentication in addition to remote PIN authentication.

Referring now to a diagram illustrating various alternate embodiments of a system in accordance with the invention is shown. The web enabled device communicates over the Internet with the financial institution server as described in detail above. The web enabled device is typically connected to a display or includes an integrated display such as an embodiment having a web enabled television. Also as discussed above a user can input authentication and or identification information such as a PIN RCP or other information such as information indicating a choice associated with the application s graphical user interface to the web enabled device using an input mechanism such as a remote control or a gaming controller.

In another embodiment the web enabled device is configured for communicating wirelessly with one or more personal mobile devices such as but not limited to a tablet computer A a personal digital assistant PDA B a cellular phone C or a smart phone D. The user in one embodiment carries with him or her a mobile device that includes a mobile device identifier stored thereon. The mobile device identifier is saved in the memory of the web enabled device such that the mobile device when in wireless communication with the web enabled device communicates its mobile device identifier to the web enabled device for identification. The process in some embodiments substitutes for the secondary authentication processes discussed above. In another embodiment the mobile device is used as the input mechanism such that the user enters the PIN and or RCP using the mobile device . In yet other embodiment the mobile device communicates its mobile device identifier to the web enabled device as well as receiving input from the user regarding the PIN and or RCP. In this regard the secondary authentication includes two layers of authentication. These embodiments particularly the first embodiment discussed wherein the proximity of the mobile device with the web enabled device provide a great level of convenience for the user . For example in one embodiment the user has previously performed the primary authentication and his mobile device s identifier has been stored on the web enabled device . In order to access account information the user only needs to move within wireless communication range of the web enabled device for secondary authentication to take place. For a predetermined period of time thereafter the user can use the application to access account information.

In another embodiment of the system the user is operating a vehicle having a web enabled display . In some embodiments the vehicle web enabled display also provides a wireless hotspot for connecting one or more mobile wireless devices to the Internet through the vehicle s Internet connection. In certain embodiments the vehicle web enabled display is the web enabled device of the present invention. As such the vehicle web enabled display performs the functions and applicable process steps discussed above from methods and . In some such embodiments the input mechanism is a touch screen or other input device such as a touchpad or keypad disposed within the vehicle and wired to or wirelessly connected with the vehicle web enabled display . Furthermore in some embodiments secondary authentication is performed using a mobile device as discussed above with regard to .

In accordance with some embodiments the web enabled device is a secure device that executes signed code only the web enabled device implements a cryptography engine to perform common cryptographic functions such as encryption decryption authentication digital signing hashing and the like. The cryptography engine may be implemented as part of the CPU or in software stored on a hard disk drive not shown or memory that executes on the CPU so that the CPU is configured to perform the requisite cryptographic functions.

The web enabled device in some embodiments is operated as a stand alone system by simply connecting the system to a television or other display . In a stand alone mode the web enabled device allows one or more users to watch multimedia content play games or listen to music. However with the integration of broadband connectivity made available through the communications module the web enabled device may further be operated as a participant in a larger network multimedia sharing community social networking community gaming community and or be connected to other networked entities.

Thus present embodiments provide for systems methods and computer program products for authenticating and efficiently re authenticating a user with a financial institution in order to gain access to account information using a web enabled device. The web enabled device stores user profiles associated with the user including authentication information provided by the user during primary authentication. The device retrieves the authentication information upon secondary authentication that is validation of the user s identity which in some embodiments includes local validation of a personal identification number PIN and or a remote control passcode RCP . As such the web enabled device re authenticates the user without requiring authentication communication with a financial institution server and thereafter the user interacts with an application running on the web enabled device to retrieve desired account information from the financial institution server.
