The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to tube launched projectiles and in particular to tube launched projectiles that are statically stabilized.

Tube launched projectiles may require adequate aerodynamic stability to damp out launch disturbances and maintain a low angle of attack throughout flight. Projectiles may be stabilized one of two ways statically or gyroscopically.

A projectile may be considered statically stable if its aerodynamic center of pressure is aft of its center of gravity CG . The distance between the aerodynamic center of pressure and the CG is known as the static stability margin or SSM. As a rule of thumb a projectile may be considered to possess adequate static stability if the SSM is at least 10 of the overall body length.

When designing a projectile stabilizing surfaces such as tail fins flares may be placed near the aft end of the projectile to produce an aerodynamic restoring moment. The stabilizing surfaces may be designed to produce enough lift so that the projectile has an adequate SSM. If the projectile is subjected to launch disturbances that cause it to rotate to an angle of attack the restoring moment may realign the projectile axis with the velocity vector. Aerodynamic theory and empirical data may help select methods for producing the largest possible stabilizing moment at the desired flight conditions while not causing undesirable side effects such as high aerodynamic drag. The greatest benefits may be obtained by employing large lifting surfaces as far behind the CG as possible.

Most projectiles have practical limitations on the size length or diameter of tail stabilizers. Tube launched projectiles in particular may be constrained in that no part of the body may be larger than the inside diameter of the tube. Some projectiles bodies such as tank fired kinetic energy projectiles may be much smaller than the tube diameter. Such sub caliber projectile bodies may be supported by and guided along the tube with a sabot which discards upon exit from the tube. Once in flight the fins are then a larger diameter than the diameter of the flight projectile body.

Some tube launched projectiles may utilize folding fins or wrap around fins to increase the aspect ratio of the fins commonly used with tube launched rockets and missiles . Such fins may be stowed within or near the body and may be deployed upon exit from the gun tube. The resultant super caliber fins may add significantly to the projectile s stability. However the cost complexity and reduced reliability of these designs may be undesirable. These types of fins may increase the aerodynamic drag substantially resulting in a loss of range. Most of these types of fins may have many moving parts. The moving parts must survive the harsh environment inside the gun tube high pressures temperatures and accelerations and then deploy reliably upon exiting the tube.

To maximize the SSM stabilizing surfaces may be located as far rearward as possible. Many times however the overall projectile length may be constrained due to packaging storage or handling considerations. Thus the stabilizer may not be moved far enough rearward to provide adequate stability. When faced with this dilemma the aerodynamic designer may resort to the use of folding fins to provide additional tail lift. While folding fins may provide the necessary SSM such a solution may be undesirable for the reasons described above.

For a full caliber projectile with a constrained length a need exists for a static stabilizer that mitigates or eliminates the disadvantages associated with known static stabilizers such as folded fins.

It is an object of the invention to provide a stabilizer for a projectile having a full caliber body.

It is another object of the invention to provide a projectile stabilizer with a minimum of moving parts.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of stabilizing a tube launched projectile.

One aspect of the invention is a projectile. The projectile may include a fixed tail boom having an outer diameter and a sliding tail boom having a through bore with an inner diameter. The fixed tail boom may be at least partially disposed in the through bore of the sliding tail boom. The sliding tail boom may be translatable with respect to the fixed tail boom. A collar may be fixed to a forward end of the sliding tail boom. The collar may support the sliding tail boom such that the outer diameter of the fixed tail boom does not contact the inner diameter of the sliding tail boom. The through bore of the sliding tail boom may include a portion having an increased inner diameter. A transition from the inner diameter to the increased inner diameter may include a tapered portion.

A tail boom sleeve may be fixed to a rear portion of the fixed tail boom. The tail boom sleeve may include a guide that mates with a complementary guide on the sliding tail boom. The tail boom sleeve may include a portion of increasing outer diameter that abuts the tapered portion of the through bore when the sliding tail boom is in an extended position. At least one fin may be attached to the sliding tail boom.

A forward portion of the fixed tail boom may include a plurality of gas openings and a forward portion of the sliding tail boom may include a plurality of gas openings. In a stowed position of the sliding tail boom the plurality of gas openings of the sliding tail boom may be substantially aligned with the plurality of gas openings of the fixed tail boom.

A retainer may fix the sliding tail boom in a stowed position prior to launch of the projectile. The retainer may release the sliding tail boom from the stowed position prior to the projectile exiting a launch tube.

Another aspect of the invention is a stabilizer for a projectile. The projectile may have a fixed tail boom with an outer diameter. The stabilizer may include a sliding tail boom having a through bore with an inner diameter. The fixed tail boom may be disposable in the through bore of the sliding tail boom. The sliding tail boom may be translatable with respect to the fixed tail boom. A collar may be fixed to a forward end of the sliding tail boom. The collar may support the sliding tail boom to prevent contact of the outer diameter of the fixed tail boom with the inner diameter of the sliding tail boom.

The through bore of the sliding tail boom may include a portion having an increased inner diameter. A transition from the inner diameter to the increased inner diameter may include a tapered portion.

A tail boom sleeve may be fixable to a rear portion of the fixed tail boom. The tail boom sleeve may include a guide that mates with a complementary guide on the sliding tail boom. The tail boom sleeve may include a portion of increasing outer diameter that abuts the tapered portion of the through bore when the sliding tail boom is in an extended position.

A further aspect of the invention is a method that may include providing a projectile placing the projectile in a launch tube and igniting propellant in the launch tube. The method may include translating a sliding tail boom rearward with respect to a fixed tail boom before the projectile exits the launch tube.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A method for enhancing the performance of statically stabilized projectiles may include using fixed fins. The method may be used with for example a statically stabilized projectile having a geometry and mass that may preclude the use of known conventional fixed fins.

The method may include using an extendable tail. The extendable tail may be a passive device that may contain for example only one moving part. The method may be used to enhance the performance of statically stabilized projectiles including projectiles having a body diameter that is the full bore diameter.

An embodiment of a conventional fin stabilized full bore tube launched projectile is shown in . Projectile may be fired from a smooth bore tube. Projectile may include a body a fixed boom propellant and a plurality of fins . Projectile may not possess adequate static stability. Because the overall length of projectile may be constrained it may not be possible to achieve static stability by locating fins farther rearward.

A collar may be fixed to a forward end of sliding tail boom . Collar may support sliding tail boom such that outer diameter A of fixed tail boom does not contact inner diameter B of sliding tail boom .

Through bore of sliding tail boom may include a portion having an increased inner diameter C best seen in . A transition from inner diameter B to increased inner diameter C may include a tapered portion .

A tail boom sleeve and A may be fixed to a rear portion of fixed tail boom . Tail boom sleeve may include a guide that mates with a complementary guide on sliding tail boom . In the embodiment shown in the Figures the guide on tail boom sleeve may be one or more slots and the complementary guide on sliding tail boom may be one or more projections . Tail boom sleeve may include a portion of increasing outer diameter that abuts tapered portion of through bore when sliding tail boom is in an extended position.

A forward portion of fixed tail boom may include a plurality of gas openings . A forward portion of sliding tail boom may include a plurality of gas openings see also . In the stowed position of sliding tail boom shown in gas openings of sliding tail boom may be substantially aligned with gas openings of fixed tail boom .

A retainer may fix sliding tail boom in the stowed position of prior to launch of projectile . The retainer may release sliding tail boom from the stowed position prior to the projectile exiting a launch tube . The retainer may include at least one shear pin Each shear pin may be disposed in an opening in fin assembly an opening in sliding tail boom and an opening in tail boom sleeve .

Projectile may be loaded in tube with sliding tail boom in the stowed position of . Then the propellant may be ignited and the aft end of projectile may be immersed in high pressure gun gases. The high pressure gun gases may act upon the surface area of projectile resulting in a force that may accelerate projectile up gun tube .

Sliding tail boom may be subject to the same high pressure gun gases in tube as is projectile body . However sliding tail boom may have very little rearward facing surface area. The area of projectile body acted upon by the gun gases may be approximately an order of magnitude larger than the area of sliding tail boom acted upon by the gun gases thereby creating a large differential force. The force accelerating sliding tail boom in the forward direction may be quite small. The difference in forces acting on projectile body and sliding tail boom may cause shear pin or pins to release.

When pin or pins shear sliding tail boom may move rearward relative to projectile body . When sliding tail boom is fully extended rearward relative to projectile body it may lock in the fully extended position by mating tapered portion of sliding tail boom with tapered portion of tail boom sleeve . Sliding tail boom may remain in the fully extended position for the remainder of the flight of projectile . The rearward movement and locking of sliding tail boom may occur while projectile is inside of gun tube . is a side view of projectile with sliding tail boom in the fully extended position.

An alternative to shear pins may be a retainer made of an energetic material or other material that may be consumed by the gun gases thereby allowing sliding tail boom to slide rearward.

The embodiment of the invention shown in the Figures is described in conjunction with a mortar projectile. However the invention may be applied to any statically stabilized projectile.

Fixed boom may be an integral part of projectile body or it may be permanently attached to the aft end of projectile body . Because cylindrical outer diameter A of fixed boom may be smaller than inside diameter B of sliding tail boom there may be no physical contact between fixed boom and sliding tail boom . Collar may support and guide sliding tail boom as it slides rearward along fixed boom . Projections on sliding tail boom and mating slots in tail boom sleeve may guide and align sliding tail boom as it slides rearward.

Projections and mating slots may also prevent sliding tail boom from rotating relative to fixed boom . When projectile is in free flight outside of launch tube the roll torque generated by fins may be transmitted to the projectile body so that the components of projectile spin together. Thus it may be important to prevent sliding tail boom from rotating relative to fixed boom .

When sliding tail boom is fully extended it may lock in the fully extended position by mating of tapered portion of sliding tail boom with tapered portion of tail boom sleeve . Tapered portion of tail boom sleeve may provide a stop and lock for sliding tail boom . After projectile is launched there may be minimal forces that act to push sliding tail boom forward on fixed boom . Thus the locking taper may be sufficient to prevent any such movement. If necessary an additional locking device such as a spring loaded detent not shown may be used to further lock sliding tail boom in its extended position.

For certain applications such as mortar projectiles fixed boom may include a conventional ignition cartridge sleeve and plug .

Wind tunnel tests were performed at subsonic Mach numbers on a mortar projectile with sliding tail boom in both stowed and extended positions. The test results indicate that the projectile with sliding boom tail in the extended position achieves greater static stability with no increase in aerodynamic drag.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
