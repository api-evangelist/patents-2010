The exemplary configuration illustrated in is provided for simplicity. It should be understood that devices in system may include more or fewer devices than illustrated in . In an exemplary implementation one or more components of system may perform operations in response to processor executing sequences of instructions contained in a computer readable medium such as memory . A computer readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device. The software instructions may be read into memory from another computer readable medium e.g. a hard disk drive HDD SSD etc. or from another device via communication interface . Alternatively hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the implementations described herein. Thus implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

As described above resource management system receives orders associated with for example content creators that wish to package and distribute the content to consumers via a number of different communication channels and having a number of different formats. Resource management system may estimate the capacity required to complete work orders and reserve capacity to complete the work orders. Resource management system may also schedule and allocate resources in real time to fulfill customer orders as described in detail below.

Databases may include WO schedule planner metrics and statistics storage and resource forecast . Each of elements may be a separate database. For example WO schedule planner may store schedule information associated with a number of different work orders along with resource information identifying resources reserved to fulfill the scheduled work orders. Metrics and statistics storage may include a database storing actual completion times by work unit processes and resource type associated with executed work orders. The information in metrics and statistics storage may have been collected and or stored by metrics collector .

Resource forecast may include a database storing information associated with capacity usage in DDC . For example resource forecast may store information identifying whether capacity usage within DDC is trending upward whether the percentage utilization of resources e.g. NEs is within some system network tolerance whether the percentage utilization of resources is decreasing etc. Runtime resource manager and or WO scheduler may access resource forecast to generate exhaust dates for NEs user groups UGs by resource type information associated with work orders to be executed.

WO server as described briefly above may include one or more servers or computing devices that act to coordinate processing associated with a work order. For example WO server may receive an order from order management system . WO server may include interfaces e.g. application programming interfaces APIs to communicate with WO estimator WO decomposer and optimizer and WO scheduler . In an exemplary implementation WO server may use the information received from WO estimator and WO decomposer and optimizer and provide information to other components in resource management system e.g. WO scheduler to aid in scheduling and reserving capacity for executing work orders.

As described above resource management system may represent the functions performed by various NEs as resource types. Resource management system may also represent the capacity of the NEs using resource capacity units RCUs . WO estimator includes logic to estimate the number of RCUs needed for a decomposed work order across the work units based on the associated assets and or quantities by asset type. For example WO decomposer and optimizer may include logic to break down or convert customer orders received by WO server into work orders WOs . In an exemplary implementation WO decomposer and optimizer may break down a work order using a work flow and preset parameter settings associated with the order to generate work unit tasks WUTs task parameters and task connectors that define constituent tasks and functions that must be executed to fulfill a customer order.

WO decomposer and estimator may forward a decomposed work order to WO server which may save the work order. The WO may include an associated list of assets and or quantities by asset type. WO estimator may use the decomposed work order and associated list of assets to generate a rough order of magnitude ROM estimate for the work order as described below.

WO estimator may include logic to receive a decomposed work order from WO server and generate an estimate associated with the decomposed work order. In an exemplary implementation WO estimator may provide an estimate based on an associated list of assets and or quantities by asset type for the decomposed work order. For example WO estimator may use the list of assets associated with the WO to generate an ROM estimate. The ROM estimate generated by WO estimator may include RCU estimates and time duration estimates for all resource types and all work units in the selected work flow. These RCUs may then be used with other information e.g. a rate table to establish a high level cost estimate to complete the entered order. In some implementations the cost estimate and or time estimate for completing the work order may be provided to the customer to allow the customer to determine whether to approve the estimate.

In an exemplary implementation by classifying an asset into types e.g. asset types customers and or a DDC operator may not have to be aware of the size and duration of assets e.g. the length of a movie associated with various customer requests. More specifically DDC e.g. order management system provides a list of normalized asset types that can be used. For estimation purposes WO estimator uses asset type information associated with what a content creator provides during order entry to establish an ROM estimate timeline information and or a cost estimate. As an example an asset type may be CableLabs CL compliant MP2 approximately 2 hours 4 GB movie class. In this example the customer may know that the asset associated with the order is a movie stored in a CL compliant format is approximately two hours in duration and has a size of about 4 gibabytes GB . However the customer or DDC operator does not have to be aware of more detailed information regarding the asset.

WO decomposer and optimizer as described briefly above receives information provided by order management system . In an exemplary implementation WO decomposer and optimizer establishes mappings from the work flow and quantities of assets to resource types and RCU reservations against NEs and User Groups UGs needed to execute the work flow. Work units may be instantiated in a database for each work order as tasks to be performed. WO decomposer and optimizer may also generate task connectors that represent configured connectors in the work flow. Using presets parameter selections across the work unit tasks for a particular work order along with the selected asset types quantities WO estimator may generate estimates by resource type for each work unit task in the work order as described in more detail below.

In an exemplary implementation NEs can provide multiple functions and each resource type that an NE can provide may be stored in a table or database. For example illustrates an exemplary table storing information associated with two NEs i.e. transcoder TC and TC that may be used to transcode assets from one format into another format. Table may be stored in databases . As illustrated in table may include configuration field resource type field quantity field type field time unit field sub total field and NE weight field . Configuration field may represent the configuration of an NE and resource type field may identify a resource function provided by the NE in field . For example TC and TC may represent the configuration of two NEs i.e. transcoders in this example that provide a common set of functions as illustrated in entries and respectively. That is TC and TC both provide functions associated with transcoding content having an MP2 format into a windows media video WMV format illustrated by entries and transcoding content having an audio video interleave AVI format into a WMV format illustrated by entries and transcoding content having an MP2 format into a CableLabs compliant video on demand CLVOD format illustrated by entries and . TC may also transcode content having an MP2 format into a H.264 format as illustrated by entry .

Quantity field represents the number of RCUs available for the resource type. In this example type field and time unit field indicate that the RCUs for TC and TC are represented as tasks per hour. The RCU value in field may represent a maximum allocation that the NE TC in field can provide if it was only providing that resource type. For example when NE TC has a reservation for 20 RCUs for resource type AVI WMV all of the capacity associated with TC is consumed by the AVI to WMV transcoding and the other three resource types that TC is capable of providing i.e. MP2 WMV MP2 CLVOD MP2 H.264 are no longer available as described in more detail below.

Table may also include weighting information for each task. For example the values in sub total field for each NE add up to 1.0 and each value in field represents the portion of total RCUs available for the particular resource type. For example the value of 0.625 in field of entry represents the 20 RCUs available for MP2 WMV transcoding divided by the 32 total RCUs for TC i.e. 20 32 . NE weight field is an inverse of the value in subtotal field . For example the value in NE weight field of entry is 1 0.625 or 1.6 as illustrated in . The weighting information may be used when calculating estimated RCUs needed to perform a task. As an example if NE TC is reserved for AVI WMV transcoding the available 20 RCUs will be multiplied by the weighting factor of 3.7 illustrated in field of entry to generate a value of 74 as the total number of RCUs consumed. In other words WO estimator may multiply the weighting factor in field by the RCU value in field to generate a value identifying an estimated total RCUs consumed when performing a task.

WO estimator may also calculate the total pooled RCUs by resource type. For example WO estimator may calculate values available for each resource type across a number of different network elements and store this information in table illustrated in . Referring to table may include resource type field quantity field quantity total field NE weight field and RCUs available field . As illustrated entry may store the value 60 in quantity field indicating that the combined total of RCUs associated with the use of TC and TC to perform MP2 to WMV transcoding is 60 RCUs. Similarly entries and store the values 30 6 and 10 respectively representing the total RCUs available from TC and TC to perform AVI to WMV transcoding MP2 to CLVOD transcoding and MP2 to H.264 transcoding respectively.

Quantity divided by total field represents the percentage of available RCUs for each resource type and NE weight field represents the inverse of field . For example the value of 0.28 in quantity total field of entry represents the 30 RCUs available for AVI WMV decoding divided by 106 total RCUs available. RCUs available field represents the total available RCUs per resource type. As illustrated in table 106 total RCUs are available across all resource types.

In an exemplary implementation reservations for NEs are made against particular NEs since NEs are multi functional with respect to resource type as illustrated in table . As a result use of one function will impact the capacity of other resource types. For example when NE TC has a reservation for 20 AVI WMV all of the capacity is consumed and the other three resource types illustrated in entries and of table are no longer available. For example assume that 20 RCUs have been consumed for AVI WMV transcoding by TC as illustrated in entry of table in . Further assume that no other resources associated with TC have been consumed during this time. As illustrated in entry 74 RCUs are consumed during the transcoding 20 multiplied by the weighting factor of 3.7 table entry field . As a result when NE TC has a reservation for 20 RCUs for AVI WMV transcoding the availability associated with MP2 WMV transcoding for NE TC and NE TC is reduced from 60 to 20 as illustrated in entry in available resources table in . That is the 40 RCUs identified in field of entry in table are no longer available. Table in illustrates the revised pool of available RCUs per resource type as a result of TC performing the transcoding associated with AVI to WMV transcoding discussed above with respect to table .

WO estimator may also establish a mapping between configured asset types and RCU quantity and duration required to complete processing of the resource type. For example illustrates a mapping performed by WO estimator . In table illustrates asset type information used to generate an estimate for an order. Table includes asset type field asset class field format field estimated duration field unit type field estimated size field resource type field RCU quantity field reservation duration field and pool availability field .

Entry in table stores information indicating that a CL compliant movie provided in MP2 format has an estimated duration of 2 hours and an estimated size of 4 GB. Entry also indicates that transcoding the CL compliant movie from MP2 format into a WMV format will consume 1 RCU for a 1 hour duration and that the available pool of RCUs is 20 per hour. Similarly entry in table stores information indicating that a CL compliant movie preview originally provided in MP2 format has an estimated duration of 0.1 hours and an estimated size of 4 GB. Entry also indicates that transcoding the CL movie preview from MP2 format to WMV format will consume 1 RCU for 0.25 hours and that the available pool of RCUs is 80 per hour.

Continuing with this example suppose that a work order from a customer indicates that 65 CL compliant movies are to be transcoded from MP2 to WMV format as indicated in entry in . In this case WO estimator indicates a resource reservation requirement of 65 RCUs i.e. 1 RCU for each of the 65 movies and reservation duration of 4 hours as illustrated by entry . That is since 20 RCUs per hour are available in each of hours 1 3 20 movies may be transcoded as illustrated in resulting in consumption of 60 RCUs. In hour 4 the last five movies may be transcoded for a total of 65 movies being transcoded in four hours.

Similarly suppose that a work order from a customer indicates that 245 CL compliant previews are to be transcoded from MP2 to WMV format as indicated in entry in . In this case WO estimator indicates a resource reservation requirement of 245 RCUs and reservation duration of 4 hours as illustrated by entry . That is since 80 RCUs per hour are available in each of hours 1 3 80 movie previews may be transcoded resulting in consumption of 80 RCUs. In hour four the last five movie previews may be transcoded for a total of 245 movie previews being transcoded in four hours.

In an exemplary implementation WO estimator may also take into consideration human resources referred to herein as users when generating estimates. For example users may be associated with user groups UGs that perform various functions associated with executing work flows. For example one UG may perform tasks such as reviewing and approving work orders. Another group may be associated with performing assemblies associated with work flows that may require concatenating assets as well as performing reviews and approvals. WO estimator may map UGs to resource types for completing the necessary tasks to complete a work order.

For example is an exemplary table illustrating resource to resource type breakdown associated with human resources. WO estimator may access table e.g. a human resource task table to establish a normalized capacity for the functions e.g. resource types that a human resource can complete per unit of time. In an exemplary implementation a one hour time unit may be initially configured with respect to table . Table may be used to estimate RCUs associated with human resources.

Referring to table includes resource field resource type field and plan quantity field . Resource field may identify individual users field may identify resource types e.g. functions that may be performed by the user in field and plan quantity field may identify the estimated RCUs for each resource type.

For example entry indicates that resource user Bob performs approvals and reviews and that the RCUs for these resource types take an estimated 50 and 20 RCUs respectively. As further illustrated in entry resource user Joe performs approvals reviews and assemblies and that the RCUs for these tasks consume an estimated 50 20 and 10 RCUs respectively. The total plan RCUs for the five users illustrated in table are 280.

In addition WO estimator may establish a plan weight by function associated with UGs similar to that described above for NEs . However allocation of human resources may be at the UG level instead of being associated specific users. In this manner tasks can be performed by any user of the User Group as long as his her access is sufficient. For example one user group may include Bob Mary and Joe and a second user group may include Joe Susan and Reza. In this case Joe may overlap into both of the UGs

WO estimator may also review schedule information and based on the RCUs and duration required provide estimated start and end date times for each work unit task and as a result provide an estimated start end time for the entire work order. In an exemplary implementation WO estimator does not make any resource reservations regarding NEs UGs. That is resource reservation may be performed by other components e.g. WO scheduler runtime resource manager etc. . WO estimator may also generate estimated cost information as described in more detail below.

WO scheduler may include logic to match the estimates of each resource type required for each work unit for a work order into a timed schedule of allocations across network elements and user groups. For example WO scheduler may generate scheduled start end times for each work unit task and resource reservations per its priority. WO scheduler may store this information in WO schedule planner .

Referring back to runtime resource manager may include logic to interface with command processor when allocating network elements user groups at the time of execution. For example runtime resource manager may allocate network elements user groups to a process at the time of execution on behalf of a work unit. Runtime resource manager may also attempt to honor scheduled reservations of resources stored in WO schedule planner . However if the resources are unavailable runtime resource manager may attempt to obtain replacement resources as described in detail below.

Metrics collector as described briefly above may include logic that receives actual completion times by work unit and resource type from WO execution module. This information may be stored in metrics and statistics storage and used to refine estimates for future work orders.

Jeopardy manager may include logic that monitors ongoing work order processing. For example jeopardy manager may monitor actual completion metrics against expected completion rates metrics. In one implementation jeopardy manager may trigger alarms and or notices if the completion rates are beyond an acceptable threshold or will impact completion date times of work orders in process or those that are scheduled for later execution.

As described above resource management system may break down customer orders into work unit tasks associated with a workflow and estimate time and or costs associated with executing an order in accordance with the workflow. Resource management system may also manage resources and scheduling information associated with network elements NEs and UGs in DDC as described in more detail below.

WO decomposer and optimizer may decompose the order act . For example as described above WO decomposer and optimizer may break down the customer order into a WO based on the associated work flow and preset parameter settings. In an exemplary implementation WO decomposer and optimizer may generate work unit tasks task parameters and task connectors based on the work flow. After decomposing the work order WO optimizer and decomposer may forward the decomposed work order to WO server .

WO server may receive the decomposed work order and save the decomposed work order. WO server may also forward the decomposed WO to WO estimator . WO estimator as described above may generate an estimate associated with executing the work order act . For example illustrates exemplary processing associated with generating an estimate.

Processing associated with generating an estimate may begin with WO estimator identifying asset s or quantities by asset type associated with a work order and identifying resource types needed to fulfill the work order act . For example WO estimator may identify a list of assets and or the quantities of each asset type captured during order entry. Referring to the example described above with respect to entry in table in WO estimator may identify that 65 CL compliant movies are to be transcoded from MP2 to WMV format.

WO estimator may use the list of assets and or quantities of each asset type to generate an estimate of the number of RCUs needed for each work unit task act . For example continuing with the example described above with respect to entry in table WO estimator may determine that 65 RCUs are needed to transcode the 65 CL compliant movies from MP2 to WMV format. As another example WO estimator may determine that 245 RCUs are need to transcode 245 CL compliant movie previews from MP2 to WMV format as illustrated in entry in table . In each case WO estimator may generate a value representing the total number of RCUs needed per resource type to execute each work unit task in the work order.

WO estimator may also determine time requirements associated with executing each of the work unit tasks in the work order act . For example continuing with the example in WO estimator may determine that it will take four hours to transcode 65 CL complaint movies as illustrated in entry in . WO estimator may also determine that it will take four hours to transcode 245 movie previews as illustrated in entry in

WO estimator may also review the schedule of work orders awaiting execution. For example WO estimator may access WO schedule planner and review a schedule of work orders awaiting execution. Based on the number of RCUs and duration required for the work order being estimated WO estimator may provide an estimated start and end time for each work unit task and as a result provide an estimated start and end time for the entire work order act .

In an exemplary implementation WO estimator may also estimate or generate a risk factor associated with a work order act . For example during order entry DDC may allow a customer to request an order start date and time associated with when the customer would like the customer order completed. The customer requested completion date may drive a priority setting with respect to the work order. That is the requested completion date may correspond to a standard normal work order an expedited work order or an emergency work order. WO estimator may access business rules associated with estimating a work flow including estimating whether the work flow can be completed within the desired time frame. If all the tasks in the work order are within defined business rule thresholds and can be fulfilled in the requested time frame at the requested priority WO estimator may assign a low risk factor to the work order. Orders with a low risk factor may be automatically approved. That is no human intervention is required to approve work orders with a low risk factor.

In situations where the order may be done within a calculated risk factor e.g. medium risk factor WO estimator may place the order in a review queue for manual approval by a DDC operator administrator. In situations where the order cannot be completed within the requested time frame WO estimator may reject the order and request that the order be updated and resubmitted with a new requested completion date time.

WO estimator may also store the estimates e.g. RCU and time estimates and risk factor for each work unit task in for example WO schedule planner act . In an exemplary implementation the estimated start and end times for each work unit task will not lock in the date time for execution of the work units. That is no resource reservation entries are made in a resource reservation schedule by WO estimator .

WO estimator may further provide an estimated cost for the WO using for example a rate table such as rate table illustrated in . Referring to table may include billing plan field rate group field rate element field rate field and unit type field . Billing plan field may include information indicating whether the task is performed on a standard basis expedited basis emergency basis or some other basis. The particular billing plan information stored in field may be based on the time frame with which a customer wishes to have an order fulfilled.

Rate group field may indicate the task or work unit to be executed such as ingest transcode quality assurance etc. Rate element field may include more particular information associated with rate group . For example rate element field may indicate particular tasks to be performed such as transcoding storage inspection etc. Rate field may include a rate per RCU. In this example the rate may be in dollars per RCU. Unit type field may include units associated with the rate element such as task or storage units e.g. megabytes . As an example entry indicates that an expedited transcoding from MP2 to WMV format has a cost of 4.00 per RCU.

WO estimator may use rate table to generate a cost estimate for each task in a work order and total the costs for each task to generate an overall cost estimate for the customer order act . The cost estimate may be provided to the customer prior to the customer approving the order act . In addition the estimated schedule information associated with fulfilling the order may be provided to the customer to allow the customer to approve reject the order based on the estimated completion time act .

Referring back to WO server may also forward the work order to WO scheduler . WO scheduler may receive the work order and check capacity associated with NEs and UGs needed to execute the work order act . For example WO scheduler may access WO schedule planner to identify and allocate resources for executing the tasks work units of the work order act .

WO scheduler may then schedule execution of the WO act . For example WO scheduler may match the estimates of each resource type required for each work unit into a timed schedule of allocations across the NEs and user groups. WO scheduler may generate scheduled start end times for each work unit task and reserve resources based on its priority. WO scheduler may store the schedule information in WO schedule planner . WO scheduler may also change the state of the work order to submitted scheduled after all tasks have been scheduled. In some implementations a DDC operator may approve the work order prior to the state of the work order changing to submitted scheduled. After a work order is scheduled runtime resource manager may interact with DDC WOE system to facilitate execution of the work order as described in detail below.

For example runtime resource manager may allocate NEs UGs at the time of execution. In one implementation runtime resource manager may determine if the planned schedule resources stored by WO scheduler in WO schedule planner are currently available act . That is runtime resource manager may attempt to honor the resources that were reserved by WO scheduler during scheduling. For example runtime resource manager may check the current capacity to determine if planned resources are still available to fulfill the tasks in the work order. In some implementations runtime resource manager may also determine if the available resources minus the sum of the allocated resources plus the resources required for the particular task is not a negative value. If the reserved resources are available act yes runtime resource manager may execute the work order act . That is runtime resource manager may signal WOE system to execute the work unit tasks of the work order using the reserved resources. Runtime resource manager may also update a calendar and the state of the corresponding resource reserve schedule with the actual start time of the execution.

If however the resources are not available at the time of execution act no runtime resource manager may check current capacity associated with NEs UGs and attempt to allocate alternate resources as necessary act . For example suppose that a task associated with transcoding an asset has reserved TC as the transcoder to be used. Further assume that TC is busy unavailable at the scheduled time but that TC is available. In this case runtime time resource manager may identify TC as being the transcoder to be used for the transcoding task as opposed to TC. In each case runtime resource manager may allocate alternative resources if possible. In other instances runtime resource manager may schedule the work order or tasks associated with the work order at a different time.

In this example assume that runtime resource manager has identified alternative resources and reserved the alternative resources. Runtime resource manager and or WOE system may execute the work order act . For example runtime resource manager may signal WOE system to execute the work order using the reserved resources.

In an exemplary implementation WO scheduler and or runtime resource manager ensures that schedules are established to provide high utilization of network elements. For example illustrates an example in which two NEs i.e. TC and TC are scheduled to execute tasks associated with 11 different work orders i.e. WOs . As illustrated TC may execute tasks associated with W WO and WO in hour number one. Concurrently TC may execute tasks associated with WO WO and WO in hour number one. In hour two TC may execute tasks associated with WO and WO and TC may execute tasks associated with WO and WO. In hour three TC may execute tasks associated with WO. In this manner WO scheduler may overlap schedules to allow TC and TC to be used in an efficient manner. As illustrated the total allocated capacity associated with use of TC and TC in hour number one is close to the total native or overall capacity of TC and TC. The total allocated capacity of TC and TC however varies more greatly from the total native capacity in hours two and three in this example.

As described above resource management system may decompose schedule and estimate work orders. In addition in some implementations WO decomposer and optimizer may take into consideration optimizations that may be performed with regard to asset re use within a work order. For example WO decomposer and optimizer may re use assets that have been previously processed and that are still available in working storage or are available to be pulled from an archive to avoid re processing a task through quality assurance transcoding encryption etc. That is if an asset has already been processed and may be used by another workflow task or by the same workflow task when a problem has occurred during processing the asset may be re used as described in detail below.

WO decomposer and optimizer may also take into account work units that may be performed in parallel as opposed to work units that must be performed in a pipelined or serial manner. WO decomposer and optimizer may use any such parallel processing to compress the overall execution time of a work order. In this manner WO decomposer and optimizer may streamline work order processing.

As described above DDC may optimize the overall use of resources such as network elements and user groups UGs human elements to fulfill customer orders. illustrates an exemplary portion of DDC that may include components to aid in optimizing work order processing. Referring to DDC may include WO server WO estimator WO decomposer and optimizer WO scheduler and databases . All or some of the components illustrated in may be implemented in resource management system e.g. by processor or other portions of DDC . In other implementations additional or different components may be involved in work order optimization within DDC . In addition in other implementations the functions described below as being performed by one component in may be performed by another component. Further the functions described as being performed by one component may be performed by multiple components and vice versa.

WO server as described above may receive customer orders and forward the customer orders to WO decomposer and optimizer . WO decomposer and optimizer may include logic to break down or convert customer orders received by WO server into work orders WOs . As also described above WO estimator may include logic to receive a decomposed work order from WO server and generate an estimate associated with the decomposed work order. WO scheduler may generate scheduled start end times for each work unit task and resource reservations per its priority.

In an exemplary implementation WO decomposer and optimizer may communicate with databases to identify work order processing that may be reused. For example assets that have been previously processed by DDC or are currently being processed by DDC may be reused for a currently scheduled work order. illustrates an exemplary database that may be included in databases . Database also referred to herein as table may include information regarding assets that were previously processed or are scheduled for processing by DDC . For example referring to database may include asset field type field status field customer field location field and date field .

Asset field may include a title or other identification of an asset processed by DDC . Type field may indicate the format in which the asset identified in field is stored e.g. MP2 WMV AVI CLVOD MP4 etc. . Status field may indicate the status of an order associated with the asset in field such as completed pending in progress. Customer field may include a name or some other identifier associated with a customer e.g. a DMR for whom the order was processed. Location field may include a location in which the asset in field is stored such as an archive associated with DDC working storage of DDC etc. Date field may store a date and or time e.g. day month year hour in which an asset identified in field was processed.

For example fields of entry may indicate that movie A e.g. Star Wars I was processed transcoded into MP2 format has been completely processed for distribution by Customer X and has been stored in an archive of DDC on Jun. 5 2009 at 10 00 AM. Similarly entries in table may store similar information for other processed assets e.g. previews TV shows concerts etc. .

WO decomposer and optimizer may access database when processing work orders to attempt to identify whether a particular asset currently scheduled for processing has already been processed and may be reused in some manner when executing a work order or task currently scheduled by WO scheduler . By searching database WO decomposer and optimizer may avoid re processing one or more tasks through one or more steps e.g. quality assurance transcoding encryption etc. as described in detail below.

After the work order has been decomposed into a number or work unit tasks WO decomposer and optimizer may access database that stores information identifying processed assets act . WO decomposer and optimizer may determine whether any asset listed in database may be reused for the current work order act . For example WO decomposer and optimizer may determine if one or more tasks in the work order associated with processing the movie has already been performed. If WO decomposer and optimizer determines that no previously processed asset or asset currently being processed identified in database is relevant to the current work order or can be reused in some manner when processing the current order act no WO estimator may provide an estimate for executing the work order and WO scheduler may schedule the tasks for execution as described above with respect to act . In some implementations if WO decomposer and optimizer determines that no previously processed asset or asset currently being processed identified in database can be reused in its existing format when processing the current work order act no WO decomposer and optimizer may perform additional processing as described below with respect to .

If however WO decomposer and optimizer determines that one or more assets identified in table can be reused when processing the current work order act yes WO decomposer and optimizer may identify the particular asset to be reused act . As an example assume that the current work order involves transcoding the movie Toy Story 3 into an MP4 format suitable for mobile device viewing and that entry in table indicates that the Toy Story 3 movie is stored in working storage of DDC in MP4 format. In this case WO decomposer and optimizer may identify the asset identified in entry in table as being able to be reused for the current work order.

WO decomposer and optimizer may also identify whether any additional tasks need to be performed with respect to the current work order act . For example WO decomposer and optimizer may determine whether the identified asset exactly matches the needed output for the current work order. If the previously processed asset matches the desired output for the current work order and no additional tasks need to be performed with respect to the current work order act no WO decomposer and optimizer may signal WO scheduler to simply retrieve the processed asset at a desired or scheduled time to meet the customer s order requirement act . That is WO decomposer and optimizer may forward information from location field and WO scheduler may schedule that asset for retrieval at the desired time.

If however additional tasks need to be performed for the current work order act yes WO decomposer and optimizer may identify the additional tasks that need to be performed. WO estimator may generate an estimate for the additional tasks to be performed and WO scheduler may schedule the additional tasks act . For example assume that the current work order involved transcoding the movie Toy Story 3 into MP4 format and a movie preview needed to be inserted into the movie. Further assume that the asset identified in entry does not include the preview. In this case WO decomposer and optimizer may identify tasks associated with concatenating the preview at the beginning of the MP4 formatted movie. WO estimator may estimate the RCUs needed for this task i.e. inserting the preview and WO scheduler may schedule the task as described above with respect to .

Runtime resource manager may then retrieve the previously processed asset from working storage of DDC act . That is runtime resource manager may retrieve the MP4 transcoded movie identified from location field of entry . WO execution system may then execute the additional tasks at the scheduled time act . In this manner assets previously processed by DDC may be reused in part or in whole when processing new work orders. This may save significant time and resources when processing customer orders.

WO decomposer and optimizer may also perform other types of work order optimizations. For example as described above with respect to at act in some implementations if WO decomposer and optimizer determines that no previously processed asset or asset currently being processed that is identified in database is in a form that can be reused in its current format state for a current work order act no WO decomposer and optimizer may perform additional processing to optimize work order processing as described below.

For example an asset encoded into one particular format may be useful when transcoding an asset into another format. As an example fields and of entry in table indicates that movie A has been transcoded into an MP2 format. Field of entry indicates that the MP2 encoded movie A may be used as an intermediate transcoding for a WMV format and an MP4 format. WO decomposer and optimizer may use this information when performing optimizations. For example if a customer order indicates that the customer wants to transcode movie A from an AVI format into an MP4 format WO decomposer and optimizer may determine that it is more efficient to use the already transcoded MP2 formatted movie when transcoding the movie into its ultimate format i.e. MP4 in this case as opposed to using the AVI input format provided by the customer as described in more detail below.

Other field may include additional information such as RCU savings and or time savings associated with using the asset type identified in type field when transcoding assets into other formats. For example other field may indicate that the time needed to transcode the movie identified in field of entry into an MP4 from the MP2 format is four hours. Other field may further indicate a time savings associated with transcoding the movie from MP2 to MP4 as opposed to transcoding the movie from AVI to MP4. Alternatively WO decomposer and optimizer may calculate the time savings associated with various different transcodings. In each case WO decomposer and optimizer may use table to attempt to identify optimizations available when processing a work order as described in detail below.

As described above with respect to in some implementations if a processed asset may not be able to be reused in its current state act no additional processing may be performed to optimize work order processing as described in detail below. illustrates exemplary processing associated with performing work order optimization. Processing may begin after WO decomposer and optimizer determines that no stored asset identified in table can be used in its current state format act no . WO decomposer and optimizer may access table that stores information identifying processed assets and information identifying relationships between a stored asset and other formats asset types act . WO decomposer and optimizer may determine whether any asset identified in database may be reused as an intermediate asset that is usable for the current work order act . For example WO decomposer and optimizer may determine whether one of the tasks of the current work order could be more efficiently processed using a stored asset as an intermediate asset as opposed to processing the task using the initial asset format provided by the customer. If WO decomposer and optimizer determines that no processed asset is usable as an intermediate asset for the current order act no WO estimator may provide an estimate for executing the work order and WO scheduler may schedule the tasks associated with the current work order for execution as described above with respect to act .

If however WO decomposer and optimizer determines that one or more stored assets can be reused as an intermediate asset act yes WO decomposer and optimizer may identify the particular asset act . As an example assume that the current order involves transcoding movie C i.e. Toy Story 3 into MP2 format and movie C has already been transcoded into MP4 format as indicated in asset field and type field of entry in table . As also illustrated in intermediate use field of entry the MP4 format may be usable when transcoding the Toy Story 3 movie into MP2 format. In this case WO decomposer and optimizer may identify the asset identified in field of entry in table as being able to be reused for the current work order.

WO decomposer and optimizer may also identify additional tasks or sub tasks needed to be performed with respect to the current work order act . For example WO decomposer and optimizer may determine that the MP4 encoded asset needs to be transcoded into MP2 format for the current work order.

In this case WO decomposer and optimizer may indicate to WO estimator that the MP4 encoded asset needs to be transcoded into MP2 format. WO estimator may estimate the RCUs needed for this task and WO scheduler may schedule the task s sub task s act as described above with respect to .

Runtime resource manager may then retrieve the previously processed asset from working storage or archives of DDC . That is runtime resource manager may retrieve the MP4 encoded movie at the scheduled time. WO execution system may then execute the additional task s or sub task s at the scheduled time act . That is WO execution system may transcode the MP4 formatted movie into the desired MP2 format. In this manner assets previously processed by DDC may be reused as intermediate assets e.g. in part or in whole when processing new work orders. This may also save significant time and resources when processing customer orders.

Resource management system may perform additional types of optimizations when processing work orders. For example if two customer orders are received that involve the same content WO decomposer and optimizer may break down each customer order into a work order that includes a number of similar or duplicate work unit tasks. In this case WO decomposer and optimizer may determine that one or more of the tasks such as a transcoding task may be identical in each of the two work orders. WO decomposer and optimizer may perform the duplicate tasks a single time and use the single transcoded asset for each work order.

As another example encryption of the content for different DMRs may be identical for two work orders. In this case the encryption task may be performed once and the encrypted file asset may then be used for further processing if necessary for each separate work order.

As still another example one customer order can be associated with multiple media files. During order optimization DDC may generate a workflow or let the user associated with processing the order select a workflow to process the multiple media files in parallel or in sequence based on the nature of the order. For example based on a customer s deadline with respect to the order DDC may process the multiple media files in parallel to meet the deadline. DDC may then optimize the work order processing in accordance with the deadline and as described above.

Implementations described herein provide an infrastructure that allows customer orders to be broken down into work orders that include work unit tasks. Resource management system may also optimize execution of work orders using previously processed assets or files. Using previously processed files or assets may reduce the processing associated with an incoming customer order.

The foregoing description of exemplary implementations provides illustration and description but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the embodiments.

For example features have been described above with respect to resource management system performing various tasks to process orders and perform various optimizations to work orders. In other implementations other components systems platforms etc. in DDC may perform some or all of these tasks. For example in some implementations an asset manager component may store tables and described above and manage the files associated with processed assets. In such a case WO decomposer and optimizer may interact with the asset manager to perform the optimizations described above. In addition in some implementations network may include multiple DDCs .

In addition tasks associated with a work order that involves transcoding a media file have been described above. It should be understood that other types of orders may be processed by DDC . For example other types of orders may include inserting advertisements logos or watermarks into a media file concatenating a second media file to the media file e.g. concatenating episodes of a series together inserting black space into at least a portion of the media file performing audio transcoding on the media file performing image audio overlay on the media file etc.

Further while series of acts have been described with respect to and respectively the order of the acts may be varied in other implementations. Moreover non dependent acts or signal flows may be implemented in parallel.
