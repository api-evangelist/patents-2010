title: Aiming post light
abstract: An improved aiming post light configuration wherein a luminescent material in conjunction with an optical taper or other magnification structure is positioned within the body of the aiming post along with a recharge circuit which recharges the luminescent material periodically or when light output from the luminescent material falls below a predetermined threshold. Advantageously, the entire configuration may be integral to the aiming post itself.

This disclosure relates generally to the field of artillery and mortars. More particularly it pertains to an improved aiming post light for use with for example field mortar systems.

Aiming posts are structures that are placed into the ground and used as a sighting point in aligning a weapon for indirect fire missions. Aiming posts having attached lights and are placed forward of their guns at a distance for example 50 to 100 meters. As may be appreciated replacement of the posts lights or batteries may be particularly hazardous when an enemy is nearby. Accordingly an aiming post light exhibiting a long battery life while not exposing its position to the enemy would represent a significant advance in the art.

Such an advance in the art is made according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to an aiming post light configuration. Viewed from a first aspect the present disclosure is directed to an aiming post light configuration employing a luminescent material. The configuration employs a fiber optic taper or an optical taper or other optical magnifier to produce a visible light spot from the luminescent material. Advantageously the entire configuration may be integral to the aiming post itself.

Viewed from another aspect the present disclosure is directed to an aiming post light configuration utilizing a recharge circuit which measures the light output from the luminescent material. When the measured output falls below a predetermined threshold the circuit enables an LED or other light source to recharge the luminescent material. Once that material is recharged the LED or other light source is turned off and the aiming post light output is produced by the luminescent material and enhanced by the effect of the optical taper or fiber optic taper. In this manner significant battery life is achieved as the LED or other powered light source is operated a minimal amount of time preferably only to perform the recharge. Still further the use of the optical or fiber optic taper produces a visible light spot from a small amount of light emitted from the luminescent material which at the same time is generally visible only within a direct line of sight and not peripheral thereby minimizing its detection by any enemy.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the disclosure as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

Thus for example it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the disclosure.

With reference now to there is shown a schematic diagram of an aiming post configuration according to an aspect of the present disclosure. As generally shown the configuration includes an aiming post having an integral light as shown. Shown further in that is a cross sectional view of the light portion of the aiming post .

With reference to that cross sectional view it may be observed that positioned within the aiming post itself are a luminescent material e.g. Tritium or other materials which produces light and aiming post optics which receives light output from the luminescent material at one end and outputs light at another end. As will be discussed in greater detail the aiming post optics in a preferred embodiment will enhance particular characteristics of the light output from the luminescent material such that the overall utility and effectiveness of the aiming post is improved.

With continuing reference to that cross sectional view an electrical recharge circuit is employed and functions to monitor the light output from the luminescent material and if that light output falls below a predetermined threshold will apply light to that material from for example an LED or other light source such that the luminescent material is recharged.

At this point it may be apparent to those skilled in the art that the aiming post optics employed according to the present disclosure may be conveniently performed by an optical taper or a fiber optic taper. As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art tapers provide a method of magnifying or reducing an image with minimal distortion. Advantageously tapers may be fabricated to a variety of specifications and may be machined into configurations from round to round square to square round to square or rectangular. Sizes may be varied and typical magnification rations range up to 3 1. In one representative embodiment a fiber optic taper optically transmits either a magnified or reduced image from its input surface to its output surface.

As part of the aiming post that is the subject of the instant disclosure the aiming post optics may comprise a taper and will therefore magnify light emitted from the luminescent material and received at the small end of the taper.

While not specifically emphasized to this point one advantage of an aiming post constructed according to the present disclosure is that the light generation may be completely contained within the aiming post itself. In this manner the size of the light is kept relatively small while providing some environmental protection to the light and convenient packaging.

Still further the taper provides output light that is directional in nature. That is to say an observer of the light must be viewing the aiming post within a tight viewing angle. Consequently the aiming post may remain positioned operational yet undetected by an enemy that may be in its area.

Turning now to a simple circuit schematic is shown according to an aspect of the present disclosure. More particularly a light sensor a light source i.e. LED a transistor and a battery are shown in electrical communication with one another. Operationally the light sensor detects light output from the luminescent material and when that output is below some predetermined threshold then the battery operated recharging circuit will activate the LED to recharge the luminescent material . In this manner a prolonged light output from the luminescent material may be realized while minimizing the battery drain thereby extending its operational lifetime.

As may be appreciated the light sensor may advantageously be constructed from a variety of sensors including phototransistors or micro electromechanical systems MEMS .

At this point while we have discussed and described the invention using some specific examples those skilled in the art will recognize that our teachings are not so limited. For example it is noted that while the continuous monitoring of the light output from the luminescent glow material is shown and described it is noted that other recharge strategies may be employed as well. In particular a scheme whereby the recharge light is activated according to some set schedule may be employed. For a example a timer could be added to the circuit to regulate the duration of time the LED is activated. Accordingly the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto.
