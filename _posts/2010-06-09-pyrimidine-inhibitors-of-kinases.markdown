This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 185 758 filed Jun. 10 2009 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form which is incorporated herein by reference.

Mitosis is a process by which a complete copy of a duplicated genome is segregated by the microtubule spindle apparatus into two daughter cells. Aurora kinases key mitotic regulators required for genome stability have been found to be overexpressed in human tumors. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit Aurora kinases compositions comprising the inhibitors and methods of treating diseases during which Aurora kinases are unregulated or overexpressed.

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is one of the primary biochemical mechanisms mediating eukaryotic cell signaling. This reaction is catalyzed by protein kinases that transfer the g phosphate group of ATP to hydroxyl groups on target proteins. 518 such enzymes exist in the human genome of which 90 selectively catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxyl groups Cytosolic tyrosine kinases reside intracellularly whereas receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs possess both extracellular and intracellular domains and function as membrane spanning cell surface receptors. As such RTKs mediate the cellular responses to environmental signals and facilitate a broad range of cellular processes including proliferation migration and survival.

RTK signaling pathways are normally highly regulated yet their over activation has been shown to promote the growth survival and metastasis of cancer cells. Dysregulated RTK signaling occurs through gene over expression or mutation and has been correlated with the progression of various human cancers.

The VEGF receptor VEGFR family consists of three RTKs KDR kinase insert domain containing receptor VEGFR2 FLT1 Fms like tyrosine kinase VEGFR1 and FLT4 VEGFR3 . These receptors mediate the biological function of the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF A B C D E and placenta growth factor PlGF a family of homodimeric glycoproteins that bind the VEGF receptors with varying affinities.

KDR is the major mediator of the mitogenic angiogenic and permeability enhancing effects of VEGF A hereafter referred to as VEGF. Many different cell types are able to produce VEGF yet its biological activity is limited predominately to the vasculature by way of the endothelial cell selective expression of KDR. Not surprisingly the VEGF KDR axis is a primary mediator of angiogenesis the means by which new blood vessels are formed from preexisting vessels.

FLT1 binds VEGF VEGF B and placental growth factor. FLT1 is expressed on the surface of smooth muscle cells monocytes and hematopoietic stems cells in addition to endothelial cells. Activation of FLT1 signaling results in the mobilization of marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells that are recruited to tumors where they contribute to new blood vessel formation.

FLT4 mediates the signaling of VEGF C and VEGF D which mediate formation of tumor associated lymphatic vessels lymphangiogenesis . Lymphatic vessels are one of the routes by which cancer cells disseminate from solid tumors during metastasis. The PDGF receptor PDGFR family consists of five RTK s PDGFR a and b CSF1R KIT and FLT3.

The a and b isoforms of the platelet derived growth factor PDGF receptors occur as homodimers or a b heterodimers and are found most commonly on the surface of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. PDGFR b contributes to tumor angiogenesis through the proliferation and migration of pericytes the peri endothelial cells that associate with and stabilize immature blood vessels. In gliomas autocrine PDGFR stimulation brought about by the co expression of PDGF and PDGF receptors mediates tumor cell proliferation and survival.

CSF 1R is encoded by the cellular homolog of the retroviral oncogene v fms and is a major regulator of macrophage development. Macrophages are frequent components of tumor stroma and have been shown to modify the extracellular matrix in a manner beneficial to tumor growth and metastasis.

KIT is expressed by hematopoietic progenitor cells mast cells germ cells and by pacemaker cells in the gut interstitial cells of Cajal . It contributes to tumor progression by two general mechanisms namely autocrine stimulation by its ligand stem cell factor SCF and through mutations that result in ligand independent kinase activity.

FLT3 is normally expressed on hematopoietic stem cells where its interaction with FLT3 ligand FL stimulates stem cell survival proliferation and differentiation. In addition to being over expressed in various leukemia cells FLT3 is frequently mutated in hematological malignancies with approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML harboring activating mutations.

The identification of effective small compounds which specifically inhibit signal transduction and cellular proliferation by modulating the activity of tyrosine kinases to regulate and modulate abnormal or inappropriate cell proliferation differentiation or metabolism is therefore desirable. In particular the identification of methods and compounds that specifically inhibit the function of a tyrosine kinase which is essential for angiogenic processes or the formation of vascular hyperpermeability leading to edema ascites effusions exudates and macromolecular extravasation and matrix deposition as well as associated disorders would be beneficial.

Examples of such substituents include ethynyl 2 propynyl 3 propynyl 2 butynyl and 3 butynyl and the like.

The term carbocyclyl alone or in combination with another term s means a saturated cyclic i.e. cycloalkyl partially saturated cyclic i.e. cycloalkenyl or completely unsaturated i.e. aryl hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms ring atoms are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent . A carbocyclyl may be a single ring monocyclic or polycyclic ring structure.

A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl cyclopropanyl cyclobutyl cyclobutanyl cyclopentyl cyclopentanyl cyclopentenyl cyclopentadienyl cyclohexyl cyclohexanyl cyclohexenyl cyclohexadienyl and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic i.e. may contain more than one ring . Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged fused and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl the rings share at least two common non adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo 2.2.1 heptanyl bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 enyl and adamantanyl. In a fused ring carbocyclyl system two or more rings may be fused together such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two or three fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl tetrahydronaphthalenyl tetralinyl indenyl indanyl dihydroindenyl anthracenyl phenanthrenyl and decalinyl.

The term cycloalkyl alone or in combination with another term s means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms.

If a substituent is described as being substituted a non hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus for example a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted the substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent whichever is less. Thus for example if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

The prefix halo indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl 1 bromoethyl fluoromethyl difluoromethyl trifluoromethyl and 1 1 1 trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical those halogen radicals may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

The prefix perhalo indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals i.e. each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus for example the term perfluoro means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate the term perfluoroalkyl means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.

At least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom i.e. oxygen nitrogen or sulfur with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon oxygen nitrogen and sulfur. A heterocyclyl may be a single ring monocyclic or polycyclic ring structure.

A heterocyclyl may be a single ring which typically contains from 3 to 7 ring atoms more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single ring heterocyclyls include furanyl dihydrofuranyl tetrahydrofuranyl thiophenyl thiofuranyl dihydrothiophenyl tetrahydrothiophenyl pyrrolyl pyrrolinyl pyrrolidinyl imidazolyl imidazolinyl imidazolidinyl pyrazolyl pyrazolinyl pyrazolidinyl triazolyl tetrazolyl oxazolyl oxazolidinyl isoxazolidinyl isoxazolyl thiazolyl isothiazolyl thiazolinyl isothiazolinyl thiazolidinyl isothiazolidinyl thiodiazolyl oxadiazolyl including 1 2 3 oxadiazolyl 1 2 4 oxadiazolyl 1 2 5 oxadiazolyl furazanyl or 1 3 4 oxadiazolyl oxatriazolyl including 1 2 3 4 oxatriazolyl or 1 2 3 5 oxatriazolyl dioxazolyl including 1 2 3 dioxazolyl 1 2 4 dioxazolyl 1 3 2 dioxazolyl or 1 3 4 dioxazolyl oxathiazolyl oxathiolyl oxathiolanyl pyranyl dihydropyranyl thiopyranyl tetrahydrothiopyranyl pyridinyl azinyl piperidinyl diazinyl including pyridazinyl 1 2 diazinyl pyrimidinyl 1 3 diazinyl or pyrazinyl 1 4 diazinyl piperazinyl triazinyl including 1 3 5 triazinyl 1 2 4 triazinyl and 1 2 3 triazinyl oxazinyl including 1 2 oxazinyl 1 3 oxazinyl or 1 4 oxazinyl oxathiazinyl including 1 2 3 oxathiazinyl 1 2 4 oxathiazinyl 1 2 5 oxathiazinyl or 1 2 6 oxathiazinyl oxadiazinyl including 1 2 3 oxadiazinyl 1 2 4 oxadiazinyl 1 4 2 oxadiazinyl or 1 3 5 oxadiazinyl morpholinyl azepinyl oxepinyl thiepinyl and diazepinyl.

A heterocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic i.e. may contain more than one ring . Examples of polycyclic heterocyclyls include bridged fused and spirocyclic heterocyclyls. In a spirocyclic heterocyclyl one atom is common to two different rings. In a bridged heterocyclyl the rings share at least two common non adjacent atoms.

The term heteroaryl alone or in combination with another term s means an aromatic heterocyclyl containing from 5 to 14 ring atoms. A heteroaryl may be a single ring or 2 or 3 fused rings. Examples of heteroaryl substituents include 6 membered ring substituents such as pyridyl pyrazyl pyrimidinyl pyridazinyl and 1 3 5 1 2 4 or 1 2 3 triazinyl 5 membered ring substituents such as imidazyl furanyl thiophenyl pyrazolyl oxazolyl isoxazolyl thiazolyl 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 or 1 3 4 oxadiazolyl and isothiazolyl 6 5 membered fused ring substituents such as benzothiofuranyl benzisoxazolyl benzoxazolyl purinyl and anthranilyl and 6 6 membered fused rings such as benzopyranyl quinolinyl isoquinolinyl cinnolinyl quinazolinyl and benzoxazinyl.

A prefix attached to a multi component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate the term alkylcycloalkyl contains two components alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus the C C prefix on C C alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms the C C prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further the prefix halo on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as halogen substituted alkyloxyalkyl rather than haloalkyloxyalkyl. And finally if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as alkyloxyhaloalkyl.

To determine the induction of polyploidy in H1299 cells NCI H1299 were seeded 4K well into 96 well culture plates tissue culture grade black flat clear bottom and incubated overnight to produce cell to plate adherence. Inhibitors at varying concentrations were added into duplicate wells containing cells and culture media RPMI 1640 10 fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 C for 48 hours. The plates were then washed with PBS and the adherent cells fixed by incubating with 3 formalin for 1 hour. After washing four times with PBS the cells were then stained with Hoechst and subjected to fluorescent 360 i 460e microscopic high content analysis to determine the effect of inhibitors on nuclear size. Polyploid cells 4N were defined as those having nuclear area 750 . Potency was expressed as the concentration of inhibitor necessary to induce polyploidy in 15 of cells EC15 and was calculated from least squares analysis of the log dose response.
