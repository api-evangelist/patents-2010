The following embodiments are exemplary. Although the specification may refer to an embodiment in several locations this does not necessarily mean that each such reference is to the same embodiment s or that the feature only applies to a single embodiment. Single features of different embodiments may also be combined to provide other embodiments.

With reference to a client apparatus is described. The client apparatus comprises a processor and a memory including computer program instructions . The memory and the computer program instructions are configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to output a series of missions forming a crowd game to a display device each mission specifying a task for spectators of an event to determine a result for a mission on the basis of participation and or reaction by the spectators for the task and to determine a total result for the crowd game on the basis of the results for the missions. The crowd game is played by the spectators of a spectator event. The spectator event may relate to spectator sports but it may also be another type of public gathering such as a concert a song contest a large company event or any other event. The scale does not matter there may be ten spectators or one million spectators or any other number of spectators. Typical spectator sports are American football soccer rugby ice hockey basketball baseball cricket NASCAR Formula One some other motorsport alpine skiing golf tennis etc. The spectators may be fans of a specific team or of a specific athlete for example.

Social media and communities continue to grow. There is a clear trend that social features will be built into almost all businesses. Sports and events are by nature social but there are still lots of potential to put the fans into the center and improve the social experience. People also want to be rewarded and recognized for what they do. The crowd game will allow the audience to be the stars at the event and entertain themselves via game on the big video screen . The crowd game is actually creating a totally new type of game genre played by thousands of people simultaneously in a single location making it a really unique product never seen before.

The crowd game differs from standard big screen animations and video clips developed by clubs themselves by providing much more holistic and unified experience. Also the possibility to have the same software used by several clubs and across a league offers great possibilities for comparing the different clubs arena results and atmosphere something that may happen only if the same core software is provided in multiple locations.

The basic idea of the crowd game is to entertain and activate spectators to participate more in the event by using the big screens as the medium for the game play. The game itself follows a normal game storyline with clearly scripted and designed crowd missions and tasks. Some of the tasks may be simple ones like by using an animation to challenge the crowd to make as loud noise as they can or to clap their hands for support.

As it is a game there may also be a score and potential reward for good performance. Each mission gives a certain score which is based on percentages on 0 100 scale for example. For example in a hockey game in each of the three periods there would be three to five missions. Total score and performance would be then calculated based on the average of all crowd missions. Scores are more fun if there is a way to reference them. For this reason leader boards hall of frames and other ways to compare scores between different events clubs and sports are included in the game design.

Each event is unique and therefore some adjustment may be needed based on amount of spectators in the arena importance of game identity of the team etc. It is the role of a game operator to drive the game tasks as it is most suitable for that particular event. There may be also tailored tasks or bonus missions driven based on the performance of the crowd .

The crowd game software includes a very simple and easy to use control panel for the game operator at the event. This control panel will allow the operator to change big screen game tasks easily as well as adjust scores and drive results. The software may be run from a laptop computer that is connected to video screen equipment video mixer in order to get output to the video screen at the arena.

The crowd game software client may have connectivity features that enable two way communication with a backend server. This will allow client software to upload data to server to fetch data like statistics from the server and display them at the event to the audience. This feature actually means that the crowd game extends to multiple event locations that are live at the same time. Audiences at different locations may compete in the crowd game and results may be shown and compared in real time manner. This kind of experience and software has never been created or used before.

The crowd game extends also to an advertising platform that is incorporated into the crowd game software. This platform allows brands and products to be displayed within crowd game missions. This in game ad system will create new medium for advertisers and sponsors to find their target audiences in a new way.

In general the client apparatus may be an electronic digital computer which may comprise besides the processor and the working memory a system clock . Furthermore the computer may comprise a number of peripheral devices. In some peripheral devices are illustrated a non volatile memory a communications interface an analyzer input interface a video output interface a sound output interface and a user interface such as a pointing device a touch pad a touch screen a keyboard a display etc. . Naturally the computer may comprise a number of other peripheral devices not illustrated here for the sake of clarity.

The system clock constantly generates a stream of electrical pulses which cause the various transferring operations within the computer to take place in an orderly manner and with specific timing.

Depending on the processing power needed the computer may comprise several parallel processors or the required processing may be distributed amongst a number of computers . The computer may be a laptop computer a personal computer a server computer a mainframe computer or any other suitable computer.

The term processor refers to a device that is capable of processing data. The processor may comprise an electronic circuit or electronic circuits implementing the required functionality and or a microprocessor or microprocessors running computer program instructions implementing the required functionality. When designing the implementation a person skilled in the art will consider the requirements set for the size and power consumption of the client apparatus the necessary processing capacity production costs and production volumes for example. The electronic circuit may comprise logic components standard integrated circuits application specific integrated circuits ASIC and or other suitable electronic structures.

The microprocessor implements functions of a central processing unit CPU on an integrated circuit. The CPU is a logic machine executing computer program instructions . The program instructions may be coded as a computer program using a programming language which may be a high level programming language such as C or Java or a low level programming language such as a machine language or an assembler. The CPU may comprise a set of registers an arithmetic logic unit ALU and a control unit CU . The control unit is controlled by a sequence of program instructions transferred to the CPU from the working memory . The control unit may contain a number of microinstructions for basic operations. The implementation of the microinstructions may vary depending on the CPU design. The microprocessor may also have an operating system a general purpose operating system a dedicated operating system of an embedded system or a real time operating system for example which may provide the computer program with system services.

There may be three different types of buses between the working memory and the processor a data bus a control bus and an address bus . The control unit uses the control bus to set the working memory in two states one for writing data into the working memory and the other for reading data from the working memory . The control unit uses the address bus to send to the working memory address signals for addressing specified portions of the memory in writing and reading states. The data bus is used to transfer data from the working memory to the processor and from the processor to the working memory and to transfer the instructions from the working memory to the processor .

The working memory may be implemented as a random access memory RAM where the information is lost after the power is switched off. The RAM is capable of returning any piece of data in a constant time regardless of its physical location and whether or not it relates to a previous piece of data. The data may comprise crowd game data and mission data any temporary permanent data needed during the processing and computer program instructions etc.

The non volatile memory retains the stored information even when not powered. Examples of non volatile memory include read only memory ROM flash memory magnetic computer storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical discs.

An embodiment provides a computer readable storage medium comprising computer program instructions which when loaded into the client apparatus cause the client apparatus to perform to output a series of missions forming a crowd game to a display device each mission specifying a task for spectators of an event to determine a result for a mission on the basis of participation and or reaction by the spectators for the task and to determine a total result for the crowd game on the basis of the results for the missions.

The computer program may be in a source code form object code form or in some intermediate form. The computer program may be stored in a carrier which may be any entity or device capable of carrying the program to the client apparatus . The carrier may be implemented as follows for example the computer program may be embodied besides computer readable storage medium on a record medium stored in a computer memory embodied in a read only memory carried on an electrical carrier signal carried on a telecommunications signal and or embodied on a software distribution medium. In some jurisdictions depending on the legislation and the patent practice the carrier may not be a telecommunications signal.

There are many ways to structure the program . The operations of the program may be divided into functional modules sub routines methods classes objects applets macros etc. depending on the software design methodology and the programming language used. The division divides the desired functionality into separately programmable parts. As illustrated in the program may be structured as a collection of parts . In modern programming environments there are software libraries i.e. compilations of ready made functions which the program may utilize for performing a wide variety of standard operations. Besides the basic entities described earlier there may be a number of other supplementary entities. Data which comprises crowd game data and mission data may be brought into the working memory via the non volatile memory or via the communications interface . There may be a further software entity for this operation. The data may have been brought into the non volatile memory via a memory device such as a memory card an optical disk or any other suitable non volatile memory device or via a tele communications connection via Internet or another wired wireless connection through the communications interface . Various interfaces may be implemented by a suitable communication bus such as USB Universal Serial Bus or some other serial parallel bus operating in a wireless wired fashion. The interfaces may be directly coupled to external devices or there may be a telecommunications connection between the interfaces and the external devices.

Now that the basic structure of the client apparatus has been described its functionality may be studied in detail. The main functionality includes three parts mission output mission result determination and the total result determination .

In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to output the series of missions forming the crowd game to the display device under control of the user interface and via the video output interface . This control highlights the fact that the crowd game may be of such nature that it is not possible to automate all stages of it but it is supervised and sequenced by the trained and skilled human operator observing the spectators .

In the first part the series of missions forming the crowd game is outputted from the client apparatus to the display device via the video output interface . Each mission specifies a task for the spectators of the event. As shown in the task for the fans of Team Finland is displayed on the display device chant the name of the team. The task may be aimed for all spectators or a part of the spectators . The spectators may be divided into groups with various criteria. One group may include supporters of one team and the other group may include supporters of the other team for example. The task is designed in such a manner that it induces participation and or reaction by all spectators or some part of the spectators .

The display device may be an electronic visual display for example. Electronic visual display may be observed directly direct view display or the displayed information may be projected to a screen transmissive or reflective screen . Visual information is generated according to the electrical input signal analog or digital either by generation of light active displays or alternatively by modulation of available light during the process of reflection or transmission passive displays . A wide array of implementation techniques is available for the electronic visual displays LCD liquid crystal display electroluminescence plasma display panel LED light emitting diode display OLED organic light emitting diode etc. Any technology suited for displaying information to the spectators of the event may be used.

Besides outputting the mission to the display device other ways to communicate with the spectators may be utilized as well. In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to output sound information relating to the mission to a loudspeaker system through the sound output interface . Basically loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer that converts electrical signal into sound loudspeaker moves in accordance with the variations of the electrical signal and causes sound waves to propagate through the air. The loudspeaker system may utilize any suitable technology and it is dimensioned according to the space the spectators accommodate. The sound information may be fetched from a prerecorded file stored in the non volatile memory for example. Other option is that the sound information is direct live talk by the human operator for example. In the example of the sound information urges during the task the spectators to chant louder the team name.

With reference to the structure of the mission will next be explained. Basically each mission may comprise three parts an intro section a body section and a trailer section . Besides specifying the task for the spectators the mission may include advertisement. In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to output together with the mission an advertisement relating to a brand and or a product and or a service to the display device . Naturally the sound of the advertisement may be played through the loudspeaker system .

The intro section begins the mission. The intro section may contain an advertisement or a number of advertisements and an intro for the mission. The intro may include the name of the mission and possibly also instructions tutorial relating to the mission. As shown in the intro may be shown on the display device Mission for Team Finland Chant team name . The advertisement s may be shown simultaneously on the display device or sequentially sequenced together with the intro . For the same mission there may be an alternative advertisement and an alternative intro . The alternative intro may be for example Mission for Team Canada Chant team name . The alternative advertisement s and the alternative intro s may be available for the operator to choose manually instead of the default advertisement and intro .

Alternatively the intro section may contain no advertisement and only the intro or the other way round only the advertisement and no intro . In some cases the intro section may contain no advertisement and no intro .

The body section contains the mission body i.e. the output during the task performed by the spectators . The mission body may be a passive content such as an animation or a video clip or interactive content such as a game. The mission body may contain suitable visual and possibly also audio information such as video pictures animation etc. One example of such information is shown in mission result is shown on the display device in a live fashion i.e. the development of the result is shown in real time during the mission. In the example the mission result has achieved 100 in other words Team Finland has chanted the team name in such a fashion that it has achieved the highest possible score.

The trailer section ends the mission with several possible combinations end success with an advertisement s end forced with the advertisement s or end abort with the advertisement s or any of the three possible endings success forced abort with no advertisement . In some cases the trailer section may contain no end and no advertisement . End success is a normal default ending with a result. End forced is an abnormal premature ending due to the operator or system intervention with a result whatever applies to the mission . End abort is an abnormal premature ending due to the operator or system intervention without a result mission interrupted .

In the second part the result for the mission is determined on the basis of the participation and or the reaction by the spectators for the task. This second part gives another requirement for the task of the mission the participation and or the reaction by the spectators induced by the task is measurable. The participation and or reaction by the spectators may comprise sounds generated by the spectators the supporters of Team Finland may chant the team name as required in the task for example. Alternatively or additionally the participation and or reaction by the spectators may comprise body movements of the spectators body part movements of the spectators and or handling of accessories by the spectators . The body movements and or body part movements may be synchronized in order to produce the so called audience wave. The accessories may include any type of accessory that is safe to use in a mass event. The accessory may produce sound or movement for example. In the accessories are so called thundersticks i.e. inflated plastic batons including air chambers inside to amplify the sound as the spectators strike them together in a clapping motion. Accordingly besides the motion generated by the thundersticks also the sound produced by them may be measured. The accessories may also be oversized foam fingers or hands towels flags accessories provided in the event etc.

The result for the mission is determined on the basis of the participation and or the reaction by the spectators for the task i.e. the participation and or reaction is measured.

In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to determine the result for the mission in such a manner that a human operator sets the result with the user interface on the basis of observing the participation and or reaction by the spectators . Such measurement is based on human evaluation which may be performed according to some predetermined rules or a heuristic evaluation of the observed participation and or reaction. The scale may be relatively coarse such as a four point scale poor medium good excellent.

In an embodiment the client apparatus further comprises a pulse based scoring user interface and the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to receive scores in such a manner that the human operator rates the participation and or reaction by the spectators with scores during the mission in real time with the pulse based scoring user interface and to determine the result for the mission on the basis of the scores for the mission.

The pulse based scoring may comprise two simultaneously working layers a base layer and a buffer layer. These two layers work in an overlapping fashion but have different functions. The function of the base layer is to provide static score data and consequently it is not editable. The function of the buffer layer is to provide dynamic score data and consequently it may be edited.

The base layer is the data foundation of the pulse based scoring providing real time scoring data in every loop. Base layer scoring data is only stored for the scoring database of the game software. Base layer scoring data is static information.

The buffer layer is the data filter of the base layer s scoring database. Its main function is to provide scoring data and consequently it is dynamic information. The buffer layer also converts the data to desired score attribute units.

A percentile score may be provided by the dual layer system. The percentile score may be converted to a desired attribute unit or units such as symbols numeral attributes or verbal attributes. If the percentile score is 75 for example it may be expressed as a colored portion of five stars three stars are fully colored and one star is partly colored of a symbol illustrating five stars as a numeral attribute 7500 POINTS or as a verbal attribute GREAT EFFORT .

There may be four variations to mission scoring. All four types have the dual layer scoring as the foundation and they only differ in the characteristics of the pulse specification. The four mission types are 

1. Unit missions. Goal is to achieve the highest possible unit level by shouting or making noise. Basically this may be seen as a decibel meter mission but with a vast variation of different types of missions. Examples beer breaking slapshot javelin high speed driving etc. Pulse specification pulse grading is in real time software reacts directly to operator grading. Animation delay is possible.

2. Effort missions. Goal is to achieve the highest overall effort for a mission. Missions are possible with endless variations of tasks to the audience from easy to more complex for example. Examples basic home team chant old time hockey chant speeding hey up and down we will rock you etc. Pulse specification pulse grading varies by mission directed to claps shouts etc.

3. Direct grade missions. Goal is to achieve the highest grade possible. Example karaoke. Pulse specification pulse grading by one direct grade given by the operator which may be changed as many time as needed during the mission. Final grade is given as counts as the grade for the final score.

4. Lap missions. Goal is to achieve highest amount of laps or rounds. Example audience wave. Pulse specification pulse grading by amount of laps and laps have certain values.

In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to determine the result for the mission on the basis of the information received via the analyzer input interface coupling a spectator reaction analyzer to the client apparatus . As illustrated in the spectator reaction analyzer may be a sound level meter a spectator motion detection meter and or spectator motion detection analyzer . It is important to notice here that the spectator reaction analyzer may process the raw data sound and or motion information to a more refined form such as an evaluation of the participation and or reaction. But on the other hand the spectator reaction analyzer may be a simpler device such as a microphone and or a video camera whose raw data is further processed within the client apparatus for example.

In the third part the total result for the crowd game is determined on the basis of the results for the missions. In order to enrich the spectator experience the memory and the computer program instructions may further be configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to determine a game period result on the basis of the results for the missions played during the game period. The game period result may be an intermediary result of the total result for the crowd game. On the basis of the game period results the total result for the crowd game may be determined. In the total result is displayed on the display device Total result Team Finland wins .

So far the basic assumption has been that there is one client apparatus . In some cases it may be so that there really is one physical client apparatus for implementing one crowd game. But this is just one option. The client apparatus may be implemented as a single computer a distributed client apparatus a group of computers implementing the structure and functionality of the client apparatus or a group of distributed parts implementing the structure and functionality of the client apparatus .

Besides implementing the client apparatus within one site as one apparatus or a distributed apparatus the client apparatus may also communicate over the Internet for example with other client apparatuses or with a specific server apparatus. Depending on the scale of the whole system client apparatuses may communicate with a specific server apparatus or one client apparatus may also implement the server functionality in a peer to peer network fashion for example. The system may thus include client apparatuses and a server apparatus.

In an embodiment the client apparatus comprises the communications interface and the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to receive a predetermined mission and or a crowd game via the communications interface from another apparatus. The idea here is that the entire crowd game or a mission may have been designed in another location in a centralized manner for example. The exchange of development results may promote forming of a joint experience. As shown in such crowd game data and mission data may be stored in the non volatile memory .

The communication between various sites may also promote the joint experience in other ways. In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to transmit the result for the mission and or the total result for the crowd game and or data relating to the crowd game via the communications interface to another apparatus. Accordingly the memory and the computer program instructions may further be configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to receive a result for a mission from a crowd game played in another location and or a total result for a crowd game played in another location via the communications interface from another apparatus. In this way the results achieved by the spectators in various locations may be compared even in real time if so desired. The server functionality may form from such results comparison information. In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the client apparatus to receive comparison information via the communications interface from another apparatus the comparison information comparing results for missions between different events between different clubs and or between different spectator sports and or the comparison information comparing total results for crowd games between different events between different clubs and or between different spectator sports. The game experience is also expanded between different events in different physical locations arenas . This allows battle of fans type of multiplayer and location game mode where fans from different cities may compete against each other.

The server apparatus may be implemented in a similar fashion as the client apparatus of . The server apparatus comprises a communications interface a user interface a processor and a memory including computer program instructions . The memory and the computer program instructions are configured to with the processor cause the server apparatus to design a series of missions forming a crowd game under control of the user interface each mission specifying a task for spectators of an event and to transmit the crowd game to a second apparatus via the communications interface . The second apparatus here refers to the client apparatus . In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the server apparatus to receive a result for a mission and or a total result for a crowd game via the communications interface from the second apparatus and to transmit the received result for the mission and or the result for the crowd game to a third apparatus located at a different site than the second apparatus. The second and third apparatuses here refer to the client apparatuses . In an embodiment the memory and the computer program instructions are further configured to with the processor cause the server apparatus to produce comparison information the comparison information comparing results for missions between different events between different clubs and or between different spectator sports and or the comparison information comparing total results for crowd games between different events between different clubs and or between different spectator sports.

The described crowd game may be implemented as the Uplause Entertainment System comprising missions such as crowd games clients moderator tools distribution system asset management system reporting and statistics system and crowd game mission development kit. The crowd game creates a brand new and unique MMCPG Massively Multiplayer Crowd Playing Game genre within the games industry. The main idea is that everyone can play. Based on the performance and participation in single game missions and levels points results and high scores will be provided and eventually also rewards and or prizes may be given to everyone. It is possible that as many as tens of thousands of people may be playing the same game simultaneously meaning that lots of game design attention has been put to the scoring system so that it is intuitive responsive and rewarding. The game design enables in game advertising through promotional placements. The games are designed to be easy to pick and access but will offer unlimited depth to further improve scores and compare performance against leaderboards and all time high scores.

The client instance contains the selected missions and the control panel application to manage the missions.

In addition a client software component exists for the purpose of sending mission results to the backend system and for a multisite event to retrieve receive results from missions executed on other sites related to the event or tournament.

The purpose of the moderator tools are create and manage missions create and manage events create and manage clients generate client instances build or rebuild a client for an event create and manage feeds and generate reports.

The system requires interfaces for receiving data records from clients at specific events sending data records from one client to other clients i.e. update sites information external data feeds internal data feed monitoring dashboard event organizer reporting statistics and internal reporting and statistics.

The purpose of the receive data records interface is for centrally collecting mission data results from client systems at specific events.

The client instance specific contents may be encrypted by the client using a client specific private key before sending it to the server. The server will decrypt the contents using a client specific public key.

The purpose of the send data records interface is in a multi site event for sending providing other sites comparative mission data results.

The site specific contents may be encrypted by the server using a server specific private key before sending it to the client instances associated with a specific event. The clients will decrypt the contents using a server specific public key.

If the contents are to be sent to client instance specific queues then the contents may be encrypted by the server using a client specific public key instead. The clients will then decrypt the contents using a client specific private key.

The purpose of the external data feeds interfaces is to provide mechanism to provide both formatted HTML RSS Atom for example and unformatted XML or even binary for example data feeds regarding the progress of a particular event.

Access to a particular data feed may be public or authenticated only specific users systems may receive the feed .

The purpose of the event organizer reporting interface is to provide event reporting and statistics data for reporting purposes after the event.

The purpose of the system reporting interface is to provide full and complete access to all data and statistics in the system for internal reporting purposes.

This interface also allows the creation of a real time or semi real time monitoring dashboard of the entire system.

With reference to the client software architecture in the Uplause Entertainment System will be described.

Stateless request response protocol between components modules is represented by dual arrows in the architecture diagram. Unidirectional data command control is represented by a single arrow. For simplification purposes some connections arrows have been omitted from the architecture diagram each functional component module may be communicating with a license authorization manager component module for example . Input sources coming to an input manager analog or digital may be things such as keyboard mouse that the client software operates on or external analog or digital sensors dB meters video cameras feeds etc. .

An individual mission comprises mission specific components as shown in . More than one mission might be executing running at the same time a game and a separate audio clip for example . Simultaneously executing missions are restricted to specific types and combinations of missions.

A mission player is responsible for managing the execution of an individual and specific type of a mission . The mission player may be integrated into the executable mission as a subcomponent subroutine or it might be a separate component module. Specific mission player components are required for handling specific types of missions such as animation video clip audio clip game event status leaderboard etc.

All activity events are also logged through a data manager component module as are mission specific results scores if any .

A mission launcher is a client service component module. Its task is to launch all individual missions and their status as well as communications with a control panel .

The mission launcher also isolates the control panel from mission type specific implementations and also provides for potential support for multiple computers managing multiple missions at a single event.

A control widget is a mission specific control widget that exposes adjustable parameters and general mission controls via the control panel . The control panel only provides a frame sub window area for the mission specific control widget to represent itself.

A status widget is a mission specific widget that exposes the widget s running status e.g. current score if applicable etc. via the control panel . The control panel only provides a frame sub window area for the mission specific status widget to represent itself.

An input manager is a component module that receives and manages routes all input to the relevant components functions of the client .

Typical input may be generated via the mouse keyboard on the computer that the client runs on but also external analog or digital inputs such as sensors or video feeds may be applicable depending on the supported missions and or the event venue .

A data store is local data storage event log mission scores client configuration mission configuration etc. . The data store may be implemented as one or multiple relational databases and or individual data files.

A data manager is a component module that is responsible for saving storing any data locally whether client system or mission specific or received from the backend . If applicable it is also responsible for relevant object relational mapping ORM . It is also responsible for sending the client generated data to the backend. The client and backend communication is handled via a connection manager .

The connection manager is a component module that manages the communication between the client and the backend.

The communication between the client and backend takes place by using an asynchronous message passing queueing mechanism.

The connection manager is also responsible for providing the control panel status information regarding backend connectivity.

A send queue receives the messages that the client wishes to transmit to the backend. The queueing system confirms to the connection manager when a backend message has been accepted into the queue or when one has not been accepted and in that case why . The send queue depends on corresponding message queueing software residing on both the client as well as the backend side.

A receive queue receives messages that the backend wishes to transmit to the client. The receive queue depends on corresponding message queueing software residing on both the client as well as the backend side.

With reference to the server or backend software architecture in the Uplause Entertainment System will be described.

The server manages client configurations customers clients events reporting external data feeds etc. It also in a multi site event situation acts as the relay and storage for site specific event results which other clients related to the event at other sites are to receive and use. In addition the backend is also providing a means for updating content at the client side.

Outputs are internal as well as external customers partners and public consumers web feeds and reports and client packages which represent customer event venue specific client installation packages and updates to existing delivered installed clients.

A connection manager is a component module that manages the communication between the backend and the clients.

The communication between the backend and clients takes place by using an asynchronous message passing queueing mechanism.

The connection manager is also responsible for providing the status information regarding client connectivity.

A send queue s receive the messages that the backend wishes to transmit to the clients. The queueing system confirms to the connection manager when a backend message has been accepted into the queue or when one has not been accepted and in that case why . The send queue depends on corresponding message queueing software residing on both the client as well as the backend side.

A receive queue s receives messages that the clients wish to transmit to the backend. The receive queue depends on corresponding message queueing software residing on both the client as well as the backend side.

Clients contain the software and associated content for managing executing individual missions at a specific event venue. Event statistics are transmitted to the backend and as appropriate the backend may transmit updates and data from other events venues to clients.

A data store is local data storage event logs client configurations mission configurations events venues customers etc. . The data store may be implemented as one or multiple relational databases and or individual data files.

The purpose of a client data manager is to contain the business logic regarding backend communication between the clients. It has full access to the relevant data in the data store for this purpose.

A feed and report manager contains the business logic including possible feed report specific modules for managing different output types .

Subcomponents in the feed and report manager may be a module function to generate public RSS feeds of the Uplause Entertainment System data statistics all public data or event venue specific data a module function for generating a statistical report Excel spreadsheet Adobe PDF document etc. that shows mission and ad results execution times exposure etc. and a web widget that besides just the data provides a complete feed user interface that may be embedded placed on a web site uplause.com or an associate s web site for example

The number of possible feeds and reports is not limited by the system. The configuration details and properties of individual feeds and reports as well as the related raw data are stored in the data store .

The feed and report manager exposes an API Application Programming Interface that allows for either programmatic batch access to its functions and for the generation of a management user interface.

A feed and report manager user interface provides a web browser based mechanism for a user to manage available feeds and their visibility state as well as generate defined reports or depending on the implementation also generate new reports.

A client configuration manager contains the business logic for generating installable client packages which in essence contain the required software and relevant configuration data and content for installing a new instance of the client for a specific customer event venue.

The client configuration manager exposes an API that allows for either programmatic batch access to its functions and for the generation of a management user interface.

A client configuration user interface provides a web browser based mechanism for a user to manage available existing clients to generate build new client packages . The client configuration user interface is implemented over the client configuration manager API.

A customer and event venue manager contains the business logic for maintaining the client customer data as well as event venue data.

The customer and event venue manager exposes an API that allows for either programmatic batch access to its functions and for the generation of a management user interface.

A customer and event venue manager user interface provides a web browser based mechanism for a user to manage client event and venue data.

The customer and event venue manager user interface is implemented over the customer and event venue manager API.

An asset manager contains the business logic for maintaining the various system assets mission files components such as animations games audio clips video clips logos etc. .

The asset manager exposes an API that allows for either programmatic batch access to its functions and for the generation of a management user interface.

An asset administration user interface provides a web browser based mechanism for a user to manage system assets. The asset administration user interface is implemented over the asset manager API.

A data store represents the backend database s used to drive the client generation store logs and statistics as well as all the customer client event and venue data as well as all other relevant information.

With reference to data structures of the backend data store are described. There are two main parts mission run data client to server and asset management server storage .

Mission run data includes MissionRunData . MissionRunData represents the data record of an executed mission by a specific client at a specific event. The data will be sent also to the central server after execution queued mode .

Missions include MissionTypes Missions MissionBLOBs MissionMissionBLOBs MissionCopyrightTypes MissionCopyrightHolders and MissionRuns .

MissionTypes categorize classify different types classes of missions that may be treated differently depending on the case e.g. game vs. video clip .

MissionBLOBCopyrightHolderID MissionBLOBContents typically a file an archive file or pointer to a file or an archive and MissionBLOBFingerprint.

MissionMissionBLOBs keep track of individual elements e.g. files related to a specific mission the assets that a mission consists of .

EventTypes identify specific types classes of events. A single event such as one unique concert or sports event or it may represent a long event or tournament or an entire season consisting of numerous games competitions concerts etc.

Events identify a specific and unique event that may last only hours days or even weeks months in the case of a long event or tournament . An event may happen in a single location or multiple locations.

Entertainment system clients execute individual missions through the operator commands issued through the control panel application and they include ClientInstances and ClientInstanceMissions . The ClientInstances identify all that encompasses a single client instance single personal computer at an event site and related attributes.

ClientInstanceMissions tie together the entire set of applicable missions for a specific client instance and related event .

Client server communications may be implemented via a reliable mechanism system such as the ActiveMQ message queue for example. Backend storage may be implemented with MySQL or Postgre SQL for example. illustrates one way to implement the server functionality a web server connected to the Internet through a firewall router and a separate application server and network access storage protected by another firewall router .

Next a method will be described with reference to . The operations are in no absolute chronological order and some of the operations may be performed simultaneously or in an order differing from the given one. Other functions not described in this application may also be executed between the operations or within the operations. Some of the operations or parts of the operations may also be left out or replaced by a corresponding operation or part of the operation. The method starts in . In a series of missions forming a crowd game is outputted to a display device each mission specifying a task for spectators of an event. In a result for a mission is determined on the basis of participation and or reaction by the spectators for the task. In a total result for the crowd game is determined on the basis of the results for the missions. The method ends in . The embodiments of earlier described client apparatus and or server apparatus may also be used to enhance the method.

It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that as technology advances the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are not limited to the examples described above but may vary within the scope of the claims.
