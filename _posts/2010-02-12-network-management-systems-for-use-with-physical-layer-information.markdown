This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 152 624 filed Feb. 13 2009 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Communication networks typically include numerous logical communication links between various items of equipment. Often a single logical communication link is implemented using several pieces of physical communication media. For example a logical communication link between a computer and an inter networking device such as a hub or router can be implemented as follows. A first cable connects the computer to a jack mounted in a wall. A second cable connects the wall mounted jack to a port of a patch panel and a third cable connects the inter networking device to another port of a patch panel. A patch cord cross connects the two together. In other words a single logical communication link is often implemented using several segments of physical communication media.

A network or enterprise management system generally referred to here as a network management system or NMS is typically aware of the logical communication links that exist in a network but typically does not have information about the specific physical layer media that are used to implement the logical communication links. Indeed NMS systems typically do not have the ability to display or otherwise provide information about how logical communication links are implemented at the physical layer level.

Physical layer management PLM systems do exist. However existing PLM systems are typically designed to facilitate the adding changing and removing of cross connections at a particular patch panel or a set of patch panels at a given location. Generally such PLM systems include functionality to track what is connected to each port of a patch panel trace connections that are made using a patch panel and provide visual indications to a user at a patch panel. However such PLM systems are typically patch panel centric in that they are focused on helping a technician correctly add change or remove cross connections at a patch panel. Any intelligence included in or coupled to the patch panel is typically only designed to facilitate making accurate cross connections at the patch panel and trouble shooting related problems for example by detecting whether a patch cord is inserted into a given port and or by determining which ports are coupled to one another using a patch cord .

Moreover any information that such PLM systems collect is typically only used within the PLM systems. In other words the collections of information that such PLM systems maintain are logical islands that are not used at the application layer level by other systems. Though such PLM systems are sometimes connected to other networks for example connected to local area networks or the Internet such network connections are typically only used to enable a user to remotely access the PLM systems. That is a user remotely accesses the PLM related application layer functionality that resides in the PLM system itself using the external network connection but external systems or networks typically do not themselves include any application layer functionality that makes use of any of the physical layer related information that resides in the PLM system.

One exemplary embodiment is directed to a network management system NMS comprising an interface to communicatively couple the NMS to a network and a programmable processor configured to execute software. The software comprises physical layer information PLI functionality that receives physical layer information. The NMS uses at least a portion of the physical layer information in performing a network management function. At least a portion of the physical layer information was read from a storage device included in or on physical communication media.

Another exemplary embodiment is directed to a method that is performed when a channel has been certified as complying with at least one channel specification. The method includes receiving information about the compliance of components used to implement the channel with at least one component specification and receiving information about the compliance of a permanent link used to implement the channel with at least one permanent link specification. The method further includes receiving information about the compliance of the channel with the at least one channel specification and determining using physical layer information associated with the components used to implement the channel at that time if the basis for the channel being certified as being in compliance with the at least one channel specification has changed since when the channel was certified as being in compliance with the at least one channel. The physical layer information associated with the components used to implement the channel at that time includes information stored on or in the component that identifies the components.

The details of various embodiments of the claimed invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

Each segment of physical communication media is attached to a respective port . Each port is used to connect two or more segments of physical communication media to one another for example to implement a portion of a logical communication link . Examples of connector assemblies include for example rack mounted connector assemblies such as patch panels distribution units and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media wall mounted connector assemblies such as boxes jacks outlets and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media and inter networking devices such as switches routers hubs repeaters gateways and access points .

At least some of the connector assemblies are designed for use with segments of physical communication media that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. The identifier and attribute information is stored in or on the segment of physical communication media in a manner that enables the stored information when the segment is attached to a port to be read by a programmable processor associated with the connector assembly . Examples of information that can be stored in or on a segment of physical communication media include without limitation an identifier that uniquely identifies that particular segment of physical communication media similar to an ETHERNET Media Access Control MAC address but associated with the physical communication media and or connector attached to the physical communication media a part number a plug or other connector type a cable or fiber type and length a serial number a cable polarity a date of manufacture a manufacturing lot number information about one or more visual attributes of physical communication media or a connector attached to the physical communication media such as information about the color or shape of the physical communication media or connector or an image of the physical communication media or connector and other information used by an Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system or inventory control system. In other embodiments alternate or additional data is stored in or on the media segments. For example testing or media quality or performance information can be stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. The testing or media quality or performance information for example can be the results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured.

Also as noted below in some embodiments the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated. For example the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated to include the results of testing that is performed when a segment of physical media is installed or otherwise checked. In another example such testing information is supplied to an aggregation point and stored in a data store maintained by the aggregation point both of which are described below . In another example the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media includes a count of the number of times that a connector not shown attached to a segment of physical communication media has been inserted into port . In such an example the count stored in or on the segment of physical communication media is updated each time the connector is inserted into port . This insertion count value can be used for example for warranty purposes for example to determine if the connector has been inserted more than the number of times specified in the warranty or for security purposes for example to detect unauthorized insertions of the physical communication media .

In the particular embodiment shown in each of the ports of the connector assemblies comprises a respective media reading interface via which the respective programmable processor is able to determine if a physical communication media segment is attached to that port and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached segment if such information is stored therein or thereon . The programmable processor associated with each connector assembly is communicatively coupled to each of the media reading interfaces using a suitable bus or other interconnect not shown .

In the particular embodiment shown in four exemplary types of connector assembly configurations are shown. In the first connector assembly configuration shown in each connector assembly includes its own respective programmable processor and its own respective network interface that is used to communicatively couple that connector assembly to an Internet Protocol IP network .

In the second type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are physically located near each other for example in a bay or equipment closet . Each of the connector assemblies in the group includes its own respective programmable processor . However in the second connector assembly configuration some of the connector assemblies referred to here as interfaced connector assemblies include their own respective network interfaces while some of the connector assemblies referred to here as non interfaced connector assemblies do not. The non interfaced connector assemblies are communicatively coupled to one or more of the interfaced connector assemblies in the group via local connections. In this way the non interfaced connector assemblies are communicatively coupled to the IP network via the network interface included in one or more of the interfaced connector assemblies in the group. In the second type of connector assembly configuration the total number of network interfaces used to couple the connector assemblies to the IP network can be reduced. Moreover in the particular embodiment shown in the non interfaced connector assemblies are connected to the interfaced connector assembly using a daisy chain topology though other topologies can be used in other implementations and embodiments .

In the third type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are physically located near each other for example within a bay or equipment closet . Some of the connector assemblies in the group also referred to here as master connector assemblies include both their own programmable processors and network interfaces while some of the connector assemblies also referred to here as slave connector assemblies do not include their own programmable processors or network interfaces . Each of the slave connector assemblies is communicatively coupled to one or more of the master connector assemblies in the group via one or more local connections. The programmable processor in each of the master connector assemblies is able to carry out the processing described below for both the master connector assembly of which it is a part and any slave connector assemblies to which the master connector assembly is connected via the local connections. As a result the cost associated with the slave connector assemblies can be reduced. In the particular embodiment shown in the slave connector assemblies are connected to a master connector assembly in a star topology though other topologies can be used in other implementations and embodiments .

Each programmable processor is configured to execute software or firmware that causes the programmable processor to carry out various functions described below. Each programmable processor also includes suitable memory not shown that is coupled to the programmable processor for storing program instructions and data. In general the programmable processor determines if a physical communication media segment is attached to a port with which that processor is associated and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segment if the segment includes such information stored therein or thereon using the associated media reading interface .

In the first second and third configurations and each programmable processor is also configured to communicate physical layer information to devices that are coupled to the IP network . The physical layer information PLI includes information about the connector assemblies associated with that programmable processor also referred to here as device information as well as information about any segments of physical media attached to the ports of those connector assemblies also referred to here as media information The device information includes for example an identifier for each connector assembly a type identifier that identifies the connector assembly s type and port priority information that associates a priority level with each port. The media information includes identity and attribute information that the programmable processor has read from attached physical media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on it. The media information may also include information about physical communication media that does not have identifier or attribute information stored in or on it. This latter type of media information can be manually input at the time the associated physical media segments are attached to the connector assembly for example using a management application executing on the programmable processor that enables a user to configure and monitor the connector assembly .

In the fourth type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are housed within a common chassis or other enclosure. Each of the connector assemblies in the configuration includes their own programmable processors . In the context of this configuration the programmable processors in each of the connector assemblies are slave processors . Each of the slave programmable processor is also communicatively coupled to a common master programmable processor for example over a backplane included in the chassis or enclosure . The master programmable processor is coupled to a network interface that is used to communicatively couple the master programmable processor to the IP network . In this configuration each slave programmable processor is configured to determine if physical communication media segments are attached to its port and to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segments if the attached segments have such information stored therein or thereon using the associated media reading interfaces . This information is communicated from the slave programmable processor in each of the connector assemblies in the chassis to the master processor . The master processor is configured to handle the processing associated with communicating the physical layer information read from by the slave processors to devices that are coupled to the IP network .

The system includes functionality that enables the physical layer information that the connector assemblies capture to be used by application layer functionality outside of the traditional physical layer management application domain. That is the physical layer information is not retained in a PLM island used only for PLM purposes but is instead made available to other applications. In the particular embodiment shown in the system includes an aggregation point that is communicatively coupled to the connector assemblies via the IP network .

The aggregation point includes functionality that obtains physical layer information from the connector assemblies and other devices and stores the physical layer information in a data store.

The aggregation point can be used to receive physical layer information from various types of connector assemblies that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. Examples of such connector assemblies are noted above. Also the aggregation point and aggregation functionality can also be used to receive physical layer information from other types of devices that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. Examples of such devices include end user devices such as computers peripherals such as printers copiers storage devices and scanners and IP telephones that include functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media.

The aggregation point can also be used to obtain other types of physical layer information. For example in this embodiment the aggregation point also obtains information about physical communication media segments that is not otherwise automatically communicated to an aggregation point . One example of such information is information about non connectorized physical communication media segments that do not otherwise have information stored in or on them that are attached to a connector assembly including for example information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network as well as media information about the segment . Another example of such information is information about physical communication media segments that are connected to devices that are not be able to read media information that is stored in or on the media segments that are attached to their ports and or that are not able to communicate such information to the aggregation point for example because such devices do not include such functionality because such devices are used with media segments that do not have media information stored in or on them and or because bandwidth is not available for communicating such information to the aggregation point . In this example the information can include for example information about the devices themselves such as the devices MAC addresses and IP addresses if assigned to such devices information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network for example other connector assemblies and information about the physical media attached to the ports of the devices. This information can be provided to the aggregation point for example by manually entering such information into a file such as a spreadsheet and then uploading the file to the aggregation point for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. Such information can also for example be directly entered using a user interface provided by the aggregation point for example using a web browser .

The aggregation point can also obtain information about the layout of the building or buildings in which the network is deployed as well as information indicating where each connector assembly physical media segment and inter networking device is located within the building. This information can be for example manually entered and verified for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. In one implementation such location information includes an X Y and Z location for each port or other termination point for each physical communication media segment for example X Y and Z location information of the type specified in the ANSI TIA EIA 606 A Standard Administration Standard For The Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure .

The aggregation point can obtain and maintain testing media quality or performance information relating to the various segments of physical communication media that exist in the network. The testing media quality or performance information for example can be results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured and or when testing is performed when a particular segment of media is installed or otherwise checked.

The aggregation point also includes functionality that provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point . This access can include retrieving information from the aggregation point as well as supplying information to the aggregation point . In this embodiment the aggregation point is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the PLI maintained by the access point . Because the aggregation point aggregates PLI from the relevant devices on the IP network and provides external devices and entities with access to such PLI the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the IP network that provide PLI nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The aggregation point in the embodiment shown in implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API.

For example as shown in a network management system NMS includes physical layer information PLI functionality that is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and provide it to the other parts of the NMS for use thereby. The NMS uses the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more network management functions for example as described below . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in the PLI functionality of the NMS retrieves physical layer information from the aggregation point using the API implemented by the aggregation point . The NMS communicates with the aggregation point over the IP network .

As shown in an application executing on a computer can also use the API implemented by the aggregation point to access the PLI information maintained by the aggregation point for example to retrieve such information from the aggregation point and or to supply such information to the aggregation point . The computer is coupled to the IP network and accesses the aggregation point over the IP network .

In the embodiment shown in one or more inter networking devices used to implement the IP network include physical layer information PLI functionality . The PLI functionality of the inter networking device is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and use the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more inter networking functions. Examples of inter networking functions include Layer 1 Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the OSI model inter networking functions such as the routing switching repeating bridging and grooming of communication traffic that is received at the inter networking device. In one implementation of such an embodiment the PLI functionality uses the API implemented by the aggregation point to communicate with the aggregation point .

The PLI functionality included in the inter networking device can also be used to capture physical layer information associated with the inter network device and the physical communication media attached to it and communicate the captured physical layer information to the aggregation point . Such information can be provided to the aggregation point using the API or by using the protocols that are used to communicate with the connector assemblies .

The aggregation point can be implemented on a standalone network node for example a standalone computer running appropriate software or can be integrated along with other network functionality for example integrated with an element management system or network management system or other network server or network element . Moreover the functionality of the aggregation point can be distribute across many nodes and devices in the network and or implemented for example in a hierarchical manner for example with many levels of aggregation points .

Moreover the aggregation point and the connector assemblies are configured so that the aggregation point can automatically discover and connect with devices that provide PLI to an aggregation point such as the connector assemblies and inter network device that are on the network . In this way when devices that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point such as a connector assembly or an inter networking device are coupled to the IP network an aggregation point is able to automatically discover the connector assembly and start aggregating physical layer information for that connector assembly without requiring the person installing the connector assembly to have knowledge of the aggregation points that are on the IP network. Similarly when an aggregation point is coupled to the IP network the aggregation point is able to automatically discover and interact with devices that are capable of providing PLI to an aggregation point without requiring the person installing the aggregation point to have knowledge of the devices that are on the IP network . Thus the physical layer information resources described here can be easily integrated into the IP network .

The IP network can include one or more local area networks and or wide area networks including for example the Internet . As a result the aggregation point NMS and computer need not be located at the same site as each other or at the same site as the connector assemblies or the inter networking devices .

Various conventional IP networking techniques can be used in deploying the system of . For example conventional security protocols can be used to secure communications if they are communicated over a public or otherwise unsecure communication channel such as the Internet or over a wireless communication link .

In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector assembly each port of each connector assembly and each media segment is individually addressable. Where IP addresses are used to individually address each connector assembly a virtual private network VPN dedicated for use with the various connector assemblies can be used to segregate the IP addresses used for the connector assemblies from the main IP address space that is used in the IP network .

Also power can be supplied to the connector assemblies using conventional Power over Ethernet techniques specified in the IEEE 802.3af standard which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In such an implementation a power hub or other power supplying device located near or incorporated into an inter networking device that is coupled to each connector assembly injects DC power onto one or more of the wires also referred to here as the power wires included in the copper twisted pair cable used to connect each connector assembly to the associated inter networking device. The interface in the connector assembly picks the injected DC power off of the power wires and uses the picked off power to power the active components of that connector assembly . In the second and third connector assembly configurations and some of the connector assemblies are not directly connected to the IP network and therefore are unable to receive power directly from the power wires. These connector assemblies receive power from the connector assemblies that are directly connected to the IP network via the local connections that communicatively such connector assemblies to one another. In the fourth configuration the interface picks the injected DC power off of the power wires and supplies power to the master processor and each of the slave processors over the backplane.

In the particular embodiment shown in the system also supports conventional physical layer management PLM operations such as the tracking of moves adds and changes of the segments of physical media that are attached to the ports of the connector assemblies and providing assistance with carrying out moves adds and changes. PLI provided by the aggregation point can be used to improve upon conventional guided MAC processes. For example information about the location of the port and the visual appearance for example the color or shape of the relevant physical media segment or connector attached thereto can be communicated to a technician to assist the technician in carrying out a move add or change. This information can be communicated to a computer or smartphone used by the technician. Moreover the PLI functionality that resides in the system can also be used to verify that a particular MAC was properly carried out by checking that the expected physical media segment is located in the expected port . If that is not the case an alert can be sent to the technician so that the technician can correct the issue.

The PLM functionality included in the system can also support conventional techniques for guiding the technician in carrying out a MAC for example by illuminating one or more light emitting diodes LEDs to direct a technician to a particular connector assembly and or to a particular port or by displaying messages on a liquid crystal display LCD included on or near the connector assemblies .

Other PLM functions include keeping historical logs about the media connected to the connector assembly. In the embodiment shown in the aggregation point includes PLM functionality that implements such PLM functions. The PLM functionality does this using the physical layer information that is maintained at the aggregation point .

The IP network is typically implemented using one or more inter networking devices. As noted above an inter networking device is a type of connector assembly and a particular implementation of an inter networking device is referenced separately in for ease of explanation only . Generally an inter networking device can be configured to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its ports and to communicate the media information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the inter networking device itself to an aggregation point like any other connector assembly described here.

In addition to connector assemblies the techniques described here for reading media information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media can be used in one or more end nodes of the network. For example computers such as laptops servers desktop computers or special purpose computing devices such as IP telephones IP multi media appliances and storage devices can be configured to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical communication media that are attached to their ports and to communicate the media information the read from the attached segments of media as well as information about the devices themselves to an aggregation point as described here.

Each port comprises a first attachment point and a second attachment point . The first attachment point is used to attach a first segment of physical communication media to the port and the second attachment point is used to attach a second segment of physical communication media to the port .

In the particular embodiment shown in the first attachment point is located near the rear of the connector assembly. As a consequence the first attachment point and the first segment of physical media attached thereto are also referred to here as the rear attachment point and the rear media segment respectively. Also in this embodiment the rear attachment point is configured to attach the rear media segment to the port in a semi permanent manner. As used herein a semi permanent attachment is one that is designed to be changed relatively infrequently if ever. This is also referred to sometimes as a one time connection. Examples of suitable rear connectors include punch down blocks in the case of copper physical media and fiber adapters fiber splice points and fiber termination points in the case of optical physical media .

In the embodiment shown in the second attachment point is located near the front of the connector assembly . As a consequence the second attachment point and the second segment of physical media are also referred to here as the front attachment point and the front media segment respectively. In the embodiment shown in the front attachment point for each port is designed for use with connectorized front media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. As used herein a connectorized media segment is a segment of physical communication media that includes a connector at at least one end of the segment. The front attachment point is implemented using a suitable connector or adapter that mates with the corresponding connector on the end of the front media segment . The connector is used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the front media segment to the port . Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible modular jacks or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors or adapters . The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Each port communicatively couples the respective rear attachment point to the respective front attachment point . As a result a rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point is communicatively coupled to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point . In one implementation each port is designed for use with a rear media segment and a front media segment that comprise the same type of physical communication media in which case each port communicatively couples any rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point at the physical layer level without any media conversion. In other implementations each port communicatively couples any rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point in other ways for example using a media converter if the rear media segment and the front media segment comprise different types of physical communication media .

As shown in the port is configured for use with front media segments that include a storage device in which the media information for that media segment is stored. The storage device includes a storage device interface that when the corresponding connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to a front attachment point of the port communicatively couples the storage device to a corresponding media reading interface so that the associated programmable processor can read the information stored in the storage device . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector itself houses the storage device . In another implementation of such an embodiment the storage device is housed within a housing that is separate from the connector . In such an implementation the housing is configured so that it can be snapped onto the media segment or the connector with the storage device interface positioned relative to the connector so that the storage device interface will properly mate with the media reading interface when the connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to the front attachment point .

In some implementations at least some of the information stored in the storage device can be updated in the field for example by having an associated programmable processor cause additional information to be written to the storage device or changing or deleting information that was previously stored in the storage device . For example in some implementations some of the information stored in the storage device cannot be changed in the field for example identifier information or manufacturing information while some of the other information stored in the storage device can be changed in the field for example testing media quality or performance information . In other implementations none of the information stored in the storage device can be updated in the field.

Also the storage device may also include a processor or micro controller in addition to storage for the media information. In which case the micro controller included in the storage device can be used to execute software or firmware that for example controls one or more LEDs attached to the storage device . In another example the micro controller executes software or firmware that performs an integrity test on the front media segment for example by performing a capacitance or impedance test on the sheathing or insulator that surrounds the front physical communication media segment which may include a metallic foil or metallic filler for such purposes . In the event that a problem with the integrity of the front media segment is detected the micro controller can communicate that fact to the programmable processor associated with the port using the storage device interface for example by raising an interrupt . The micro controller can also be used for other functions.

Each patch panel comprises a set of ports for example 16 32 48 or 512 ports . The number of ports can vary from patch panel to patch panel .

Each of the ports is implemented as shown in . In general in the context of the embodiment shown in each front media segment comprises a patch cord that is used to selectively cross connect two ports from the same or different patch panels . In this embodiment each patch cord has a modular plug attached to each end that can be inserted into a front media connector of one of the ports of the patch panels .

In this way respective rear media segments not shown in coupled to the two cross connected ports can be communicatively coupled to one another in order to implement a logical communication link between the equipment that is coupled to the respective rear media segments. For example in one exemplary application a wall mounted jack is communicatively coupled to a rear connector of a port using a suitable rear media segment such as a copper or fiber cable. The cable is typically routed through a building for example over under around and or through walls ceilings floors and the like and is not easily or frequently moved. If a first piece of equipment that is connected to one such wall mounted jack needs to be communicatively coupled to a second piece of equipment that is connected to another such wall mounted jack a patch cord can be used to establish the connection.

As shown in a master processor unit MPU is also housed within the chassis . The master processor unit MPU communicates with slave processor modules included in each of the patch panels over a backplane . is a block diagram of one embodiment of each slave processor module shown in . Each slave processor module comprises a slave programmable processor that executes software . The execution of the software causes the slave processor to carry out various functions described below. Each slave processor module also includes memory that is coupled to the slave processor for storing program instructions and data. The slave processor in each slave processor module is coupled to the backplane using a suitable interface.

The system is designed to be used with patch cords or other front media segments that have identifier and attribute information of the type described above in connection with stored in or on them. Each of the ports of each patch panel comprises a respective media reading interface not shown in . The slave programmable processor in each patch panel is communicatively coupled to each of the media reading interfaces in that patch panel using a bus or other interconnect not shown . The slave programmable processor is configured to determine if the state of a port changes. The state of a port changes for example when a patch cord is inserted into a previously empty front connector or when a patch cord is removed from a front connector or when a different patch cord is inserted into a previously occupied front connector.

In one implementation of such an embodiment each media reading interface is configured so that the slave programmable processor can detect changes in the state of each port . For example the electrical contact structure of the media reading interface can be configured so that an electrical signal changes state when a patch cord is inserted into or removed from a port for example by closing or opening an electrical circuit . The slave processor detects such state changes to detect when a patch cord has been inserted into or removed from the front connector of each port . Examples of such contact structures are U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 252 395 filed on Oct. 16 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY IN ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS AND METHODS THEREOF also referred to here as the 395 application U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 253 208 filed on Oct. 20 2009 titled ELECTRICAL PLUG FOR MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS also referred to here as the 208 application and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 252 964 filed on Oct. 19 2009 titled ELECTRICAL PLUG FOR MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS also referred to here as the 964 application . The 395 application the 208 application and the 964 application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Alternatively the slave processor can be configured to periodically scan all of the media reading interfaces included in that patch panel to determine if the state of any of the associated ports has changed.

Also when the software executing on the slave programmable processor in each patch panel determines that a patch cord has been inserted into a previously empty front connector or that a different patch cord has been inserted into a previously connected front connector the software reads the information stored in or on the inserted patch cord.

Any changes in the state of the patch panel ports and the information that is read from the patch cords are communicated to the MPU over the backplane . The port state information and the information read from the patch cords are collectively referred to here as port information. 

The software executing on the slave programmable processor in each patch panel also communicates information about the respective patch panel to the MPU over the backplane such information is also referred to here as patch panel information .

The remainder of the description of the embodiment shown in generally refers to the patch cord shown in . However it is to be understood that other patch cords can be used such as the patch cord shown in .

The aggregation point is typically implemented as software that executes on a workstation or other computer . The workstation comprises at least one programmable processor on which the software executes. The software comprises program instructions that are stored or otherwise embodied on an appropriate storage medium or media from which at least a portion of the program instructions are read by the programmable processor for execution thereby. The workstation also comprises memory for storing the program instructions and any related data during execution of the software .

The workstation on which the aggregation point software executes also includes one or more interfaces that communicatively couple the aggregation point to devices or entities with which it communicates. More specifically the one or more interfaces communicatively couple the aggregation point to these devices or entities over the one or more IP networks . In one implementation of such an embodiment at least one of the interfaces comprises an ETHERNET network interface for coupling the aggregation point to the one or more IP networks .

The aggregation point software comprises PLI aggregation software that enables the aggregation point to automatically discover and connect with devices that are able provide PLI and other information to the aggregation point such as the patch panels . The aggregation point and the PLI aggregation software can be used to receive physical layer information from various types of connector assemblies that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media. Examples of such devices are noted above and include for example patch panels and inter networking devices. Also the aggregation point and PLI aggregation software can also be used to receive physical layer information from other types of devices that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. Examples of such devices include end user devices such as computers peripherals for example printers copiers storage devices and scanners and IP telephones that include functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media.

In the particular embodiment shown in the PLI aggregation software comprises software that uses one or more discovery protocols to discover and connect with devices that are able to provide PLI information to the aggregation point assuming those devices also support those discovery protocols . Examples of discovery protocols include without limitation Multicast DNS mDNS DNS based Service Discovery DNS SD Universal Plug and Play UPnP Simple Device Discovery Protocol SDDP and Service Location Protocol SLP as well as proprietary protocols and extensions of other protocols such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP . In this embodiment when a patch panel or other device that is able to provide PLI information to the aggregation point is first coupled to the LAN the MPU of the patch panel first obtains an IP address typically from a DHCP server for the LAN . The MPU in the patch panel then uses the discovery protocol to broadcast an informational message to the other nodes on the LAN . The informational message includes information about the services that the patch panel provides which in this case includes services related to providing PLI information for the patch panel and patch cords coupled to the patch panels . The aggregation point listens for such informational messages. When the aggregation point receives an informational message from a patch panel that it can manage the aggregation point uses the discovery protocols to send a corresponding message to the patch panel using the address information included in the received informational message requesting more information about the patch panel . In response to this request MPU in the patch panel provides the requested information. At this point the aggregation point is able to control and receive notifications from the MPU in the patch panel . Similar processing can be performed when other devices that provide PLI to an aggregation point such as the inter network device join the LAN .

Likewise when an aggregation point is connected to the LAN the discovery protocol software uses the discovery protocols to broadcast an informational message to all the nodes on the LAN . This message indicates that the aggregation point is searching for devices and or services that include the PLI functionality described here. Devices that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point devices such as patch panels and inter network devices listen for such messages. If those devices meet the search criteria set forth in the message the devices respond with an appropriate message advertising the services they provide. When the aggregation point receives such a message from a device that it can manage the software sends a message to that device using the address information included in the received message requesting more information about that device. In response to this request the device provides the requested information to the aggregation point . At this point the aggregation point is able to control and receive notifications from the device.

In this way when devices that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point are coupled to the LAN the aggregation points is able to automatically discover the device and start aggregating physical layer information for that device without requiring a technician installing the device to know about the aggregation points that are on the LAN . Similarly when the aggregation point is coupled to the LAN the aggregation point is able to automatically discover and interact with devices that are capable of providing PLI to the aggregation point without requiring the technician installing the aggregation point to know about such devices that are on the LAN . Thus the physical layer information resources described here can be easily integrated into the LAN .

In the embodiment shown in the PLI aggregation software also includes software that is configured to obtain physical layer information from the devices it has discovered and connected to using the discovery protocol software for example devices such as the patch panels and inter network devices . A database manager is used to store the PLI information that the aggregation software obtains in a database. In the particular embodiment shown in the software uses one or more appropriate protocols to communicate physical layer information to and from such devices. Examples of protocols that can be used include without limitation the File Transfer Protocol FTP the Trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP the Common Gateway Interface CGI protocol the Representational State Transfer REST protocol and the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP . The devices that the aggregation point receives information from also implement at least some of the protocols implemented by the aggregation point to organize track store and communicate physical layer information.

The aggregation point and aggregation software can also be used to obtain other types of physical layer information. For example in this embodiment the aggregation software also obtains information about physical communication media segments that is not otherwise automatically communicated to an aggregation point. One example of such information is information about non connectorized cables that do not otherwise have information stored in or on them that are attached to a patch panel including for example information indicating which ports of the patch panel are connected to which ports of other devices in the network by that cable as well as media information about the cable .

Another example of such information is information about patch cords that are connected to devices that are not be able to read media information that is stored in or on the patch cords that are attached to their ports and or that are not able to communicate such information to the aggregation point for example because such devices do not include such functionality because such devices are used with patch cords that do not have media information stored in or on them and or because bandwidth is not available for communicating such information to the aggregation point . In this example this information can include for example information about the devices themselves such as the devices MAC addresses and IP addresses if assigned to such devices information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network and information about the physical media attached to the ports of the devices. This information can be provided to the aggregation point for example by manually entering such information into a file such as a spreadsheet and then uploading the file to the aggregation point in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. Such information can also for example be directly entered using a user interface provided by the aggregation point for example using a web browser . In the embodiment shown in the aggregation point software includes a web server to facilitate the upload of files and or the direct entry of such manually entered information.

The aggregation software can also obtain information about the layout of the building or buildings in which the network is deployed as well as information indicating where each patch panel device patch cord or other item of physical communication media and inter networking device is located within the building. This information can be for example manually entered and uploaded to the aggregation point in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. In one implementation such location information includes an X Y and Z location for each port or other termination point for each physical communication media segment that is terminated in the network for example X Y and Z location information of the type specified in ANSI TIA EIA 606 A Standard Administration Standard For The Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure .

The aggregation software can also obtain and maintain testing media quality or performance information relating to the various items of physical communication media that exist in the network. The testing media quality or performance information for example can be results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured and or when testing is performed when a particular segment of media is installed or otherwise checked.

The aggregation software also provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point . This access can include retrieving information from the aggregation point as well as supplying information to the aggregation point . In this embodiment the aggregation point is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the PLI maintained by the access point . Because the aggregation point aggregates PLI from the relevant devices on the IP network and provides external devices and entities with access to such PLI the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the IP network that provide PLI nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The aggregation point software in the embodiment shown in implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality in such other devices can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API . In one implementation of such an embodiment the API is configured to use the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP protocol for communications between the aggregation point and such external devices or entities. In other implementations other protocols can be used for example the SNMP or CGI protocols .

For example an application shown in executing on a computer can use the API provided by the aggregation point to access the PLI information maintained by the aggregation point for example to retrieve such information from the aggregation point and or to supply information to the aggregation point . The computer is coupled to the LAN and accesses the aggregation point over the LAN .

The NMS is typically implemented as software that executes on a workstation or other computer . The workstation comprises at least one programmable processor on which the software executes. The software comprises program instructions that are stored or otherwise embodied on an appropriate storage medium or media from which at least a portion of the program instructions are read by the programmable processor for execution thereby. The workstation also comprises memory for storing the program instructions and any related data during execution of the software .

The workstation on which the NMS software executes also includes one or more interfaces that communicatively couple the NMS to the network elements that the NMS manages and otherwise interacts with. More specifically the one or more interfaces communicatively couple the NMS to these network elements over the one or more IP networks . In one implementation of such an embodiment at least one of the interfaces comprises an ETHERNET network interface for coupling the NMS to the one or more IP networks .

The NMS software comprises network management functionality that implements various conventional NMS functions such as displaying status and alarm information about the various elements in the managed network. In the particular embodiment described here the NMS functionality includes functionality for displaying a user interface for the NMS and data management functionality for organizing tracking and storing the information it receives from the managed network elements.

The NMS software also includes physical layer information PLI functionality . The PLI functionality is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and provide it to the NMS functionality for use thereby. The NMS functionality uses the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more network management functions. In the embodiment shown in the PLI functionality retrieves physical layer information from the aggregation point using the API shown in implemented by the aggregation point . To do this the PLI functionality supports the protocol used by the API . The NMS software communicates with the aggregation point over the IP networks . The aggregation point software executing on the aggregation point processes and responds to API calls from the NMS .

The retrieved physical layer information can be used by the NMS to provide Layer 1 of the OSI model resolution in the information it displays. For example in one implementation of the embodiment shown in the NMS software displays a graphical representation of the managed network that shows the logical communication links between various network elements. When a user clicks on one of the logical communication links the NMS software uses the PLI functionality to display the various physical layer items for example physical communication media patch panels and wall outlets that implement that logical communication link as well as information about those physical layer items for example their location product name type color length temperature etc. that was retrieved from the aggregation point .

In the particular embodiment shown in the NMS software also includes physical layer management functionality that uses the physical layer information received from the aggregation point to carry out various PLM functions. For example the PLM functionality enables the NMS to manage patch cord moves adds or changes MAC for the patch panels . This can be done by having the PLM functionality communicate information about the MAC to a computer or other device used by the technician using the network . This information can include physical layer information received from an aggregation point for example information identifying particular ports patch panels and patch cords involved in the MAC and the locations thereof as well as information about the visual attributes of the items involved in the MAC . Also the PLM functionality enables the NMS to receive alarms and warning messages from the aggregation point that are related to moves adds or changes for example when an unrequested move add or change has been made or where a requested move add or change was made incorrectly . In other words the PLM functionality in the NMS can be used to verify that a particular requested MAC was properly implemented and if it was not inform the technician of that fact. In addition the PLM functionality in the NMS can be configured to perform a guided MAC in which the PLM functionality causes appropriate LEDS on the patch panels to be illuminated or flashed in order to help the technician identify the ports involved in a MAC. The PLM functionality can do this by using an appropriate API call to request that the LEDs be illuminated. The aggregation point in response to such an API call sends a request to the appropriate MPU to have the appropriate slave processor modules cause the LEDs to be illuminated.

Other examples of functions that the NMS can perform using the physical layer information include raising an alarm or warning if a predetermined specific patch cord or a particular type of patch cord is not used to implement a particular cross connection enforcing other policies and or using the location information included in the physical layer information to assist in E911 or location based services LBS processing that the NMS supports for example to determine where an IP phone is located .

Another example of PLI enabled functionality that can be added to an NMS is shown in . is a flow diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a method of compliance tracking in a network that includes the PLI functionality described here. The particular exemplary embodiment of method shown in is described here as being implemented as a part of the PLI functionality of the NMS shown in for use in the system shown in though other embodiments can be implemented in other ways .

In such an exemplary embodiment the physical layer information that is tracked and aggregated at the aggregation point includes information about the compliance of various parts of the system with various standards. Standards such as the TIA EIA 568 B family of standards define performance requirements for various physical layer cabling components that are used to implement networks performance requirements for permanent links included within a give channel and performance requirements for the overall channel.

For each channel that is being installed information about the compliance of each patch cord and plug used in the channel with the requirements of the relevant standards is stored in the relevant non volatile memory block . This information can be determined by tests performed by the manufacture and or an installer. This information can include an indication of whether or not each component associated with that patch cord complies with the relevant performance specifications as well as the underlying performance information that was used to determine compliance. In other words the performance margin or envelope for each such component can be stored in the relevant EEPROM . This component compliance data is automatically read when the patch cord is connected to a port of the patch panel and communicated to the relevant aggregation point block .

When a particular permanent link is installed for example a link between a wall outlet and a punch down block of a patch panel the installer tests the performance of the permanent link and certifies its compliance with the requirements of the relevant standards block . Information about the compliance of the permanent link with the requirements of the relevant standards is communicated to the aggregation point for example by uploading such information as described above block . This information can include an indication of whether or not the permanent link complies with the relevant performance requirements as well as the underlying performance information that was used to determine compliance. In other words the performance margin or envelope for the permanent link can be provided to the aggregation point in addition to an indication of compliance.

In the embodiment shown in the installer also tests the overall channel and certifies the compliance of the overall channel with the requirements of the relevant standards block . Information related to the compliance of the overall channel is communicated to the aggregation point for example by uploading such information as described above . The aggregation point then identifies the particular components that were used in the channel when the channel was certified block . For example the aggregation point knows which patch cords and patch panel ports were used in the channel when it was certified. If in the future one of those patch cords were to be replaced the aggregation point is able to automatically determine that the original basis for the certification of channel compliance no longer exists block . When such a patch cord is replaced the aggregation point can also automatically determine if the overall channel likely remains compliant with the relevant standards by checking if the replacement path cord has been certified to meet the component specifications needed for channel compliance and verifying that the permalink link for the channel remains undisturbed and that the patch cord is connected to the same ports as before block . Such information can be used in troubleshooting performance problems in the network.

Method is one example of how such compliance information can be used. Also the embodiment of method shown in is described here as being implemented in the NMS of though it is to be understood that similar functionality can be implemented in other parts of the system for example in the aggregation point or as a standalone application . Moreover other types of compliance information can be received and stored by an aggregation point and used in compliance tracking Examples of such compliance information include without limitation information about compliance with communications regulatory or military rules regulations laws specifications or standards.

In the embodiment shown in the inter networking device comprises at least one programmable processor that executes software referred to as firmware in some embodiments that causes the inter networking device to carry out various functions described below. The software comprises program instructions that are stored or otherwise embodied on an appropriate storage medium or media for example flash memory from which at least a portion of the program instructions are read by the programmable processor for execution thereby. The inter networking device also includes memory that is coupled to the programmable processor for storing program instructions and data.

The inter networking device includes a plurality of ports . Each port includes a suitable interface for coupling physical communication media to the inter networking device . Each such interface includes for example a mechanical structure for attaching the physical communication media to the inter networking device and a physical layer device PHY to send and receive signals over the attached communication media. In one such embodiment the ports are ETHERNET ports.

The software comprises inter networking functionality that causes the inter networking device to perform one or more inter networking functions for which it was designed. Examples of inter networking functions include Layer 1 Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the OSI model inter networking functions such as the routing switching repeating bridging and grooming of communication traffic that is received at the inter networking device via the plurality of ports .

The software also comprises management functionality that enables the inter networking device to be configured and managed. In the particular embodiment shown in the management functionality includes a web server and related web content and applications that enables a user to directly interact with the inter networking device using a web browser. In this embodiment the management functionality also includes SNMP functionality for interacting with an NMS such as NMS using the SNMP protocol. SNMP commands and responses are communicated over the one or more IP networks via one or more of the ports of the inter networking device .

The software also includes physical layer information PLI functionality . The PLI functionality is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and provide it to the inter networking functionality . The inter networking functionality uses the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more inter networking functions. In the embodiment shown in the PLI functionality retrieves physical layer information from the aggregation point using the API shown in implemented by the aggregation point . To do this the PLI functionality supports the protocol used by the API . The software in the inter networking device communicates with the aggregation point over the IP networks . The aggregation point software executing on the aggregation point processes and responds to API calls from the inter networking device . The inter networking device can also retrieve at least some of the physical layer information from an NMS or other network element.

Some communication protocols for example the IEEE 802.3 family of ETHERNET standards include functionality for automatically determining a suitable communication rate for a given communication link for example the IEEE 802.3 auto negotiation auto sensing and auto fallback features . This type of functionality performs tests to make such determinations. In other words the physical communication media is still from the perspective of such an inter networking device a black box. The physical layer information provided to the inter networking functionality by the PLI functionality enables the inter networking functionality to treat the physical layer as a white box for which it has accurate information to use in carrying out its inter networking functions for example to use in making bridging routing or switching decisions . In one implementation of such an embodiment the physical layer information received from the aggregation point is provided to the inter networking functionality to assist it in performing such auto rate selection procedures.

Moreover where such conventional rate determination functionality is used in making inter networking decisions such as decisions as to which port to route data on such conventional functionality is typically only able to characterize communication links that are directly connected to the inter networking device. This means that if there is a segment of physical communication media that is one or more hops away from the inter networking device that is of a lower quality for example because it supports lower communication rates than the physical communication media used to implement the link that is directly attached to the inter networking device the inter networking device would be unaware of that fact and would not take that fact into account in make routing or other inter networking policy decisions. In the embodiment shown in the physical layer information received from the aggregation point and from other sources such as the NMS can be used to identify such situations and respond accordingly.

The physical layer information received from the aggregation point can be used in other ways. For example the inter networking functionality can be configured to constrain the routing of communication traffic by a policy that dictates that traffic received on some ports can only be communicated through certain areas of a building or buildings for example only through secure areas of the building . In order for such a policy to be enforced the inter networking functionality needs to know where traffic that is output on each of its ports will pass. The physical layer information received from the aggregation point can be used to make such determinations.

In another example the inter networking functionality is configured to enforce a policy that requires only certain types of physical communication media to be use with it for example requiring the use of certain brands or types or lengths of patch cords . The physical layer information received from the aggregation point can be used by the inter networking functionality to enforce such a policy for example by not forwarding data received on ports that have non compliant media connected to them and or by raising alarms or warnings when non compliant media is connected to a port . In other words the inter networking functionality can be configured to act as a bus guardian that enforces a virtual keying scheme in which at least some of the media information stored in or on a patch cord is used to key the patch cord .

As noted above in connection with inter networking devices can also include media reading interfaces to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its ports and to communicate the media information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the inter networking device itself to an aggregation point. For example as shown in each port has an associated media reading interface that the programmable processor uses to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its ports . The programmable processor in this example communicates the media information that it has read to a suitable aggregation point using one or more of the communication links that are established via one of its ports .

In other implementations the inter networking device does not include media reading interfaces and the physical layer information related to the physical media attached to its ports is provided to an aggregation point in other ways for example by manually entering and uploading the information .

In conventional ETHERNET networks a spanning tree protocol that complies with the IEEE 802.1D MAC Bridges standard is used to construct a spanning tree for the network. However the spanning tree algorithm used in conventional ETHERNET networks is a distributed algorithm in which the relevant switch must learn what devices are connected to it exchange messages with the other switches take part in electing a root bridge and maintain a forwarding database. Also when a new switch is added to the network all the switches in the network must be informed by the root bridge of any topology changes that result from adding the new switch in which case the other bridge devices must update the forwarding databases they maintain.

Because a distributed spanning tree protocol is used in conventional ETHERNET networks each switch must include sufficient processing power to implement the spanning tree protocol and to perform database look ups when making decisions regarding how to forward packets it receives. In addition changes to the spanning tree topology can take a significant amount of time to propagate through the network which may lead to degraded network performance or in some cases loops. Also the degree to which a conventional switch can learn about the network is limited which can also lead to degraded network performance.

Moreover each such conventional switch typically uses transparent bridging to forward packets using the forwarding database. The forwarding database is initially empty and entries are added to the database as the switch receives packets. When a switch receives a packet it inspects the source MAC address of the packet and adds an entry to the forwarding database for that source MAC address if one does not already exist that associates that MAC address with the port on which the packet was received. The switch also inspects the destination MAC address of the packet and searches for an entry in the forwarding database for that destination MAC address. If an entry is not found in the forwarding database for that destination MAC address the packet is flooded to all other ports of the switch. In the future when the switch receives a packet from the device that has that MAC address as its source MAC address the switch adds an entry to its forwarding database that associates that MAC address with the port on which the packet was received. In this way the switch is able to build up a forwarding database over time. The forwarding database needs to be updated as the topology of the network changes for example due to a patch cord being moved or removed failure of links the addition or deletion of a switch or the movement of an end user device .

Because the forwarding database is maintained separately in each switch in a conventional ETHERNET network each such switch must have sufficient processing power to perform such processing. Also when the network topology changes occur the performance of the network can be degraded as the switches flood the network in order to learn the new topology of the network.

In the example shown in centralized bridge functionality is deployed in the network to alleviate some of the problems noted above. The centralized bridge functionality interacts with the one or more aggregation points that aggregate physical layer information for the network . In the particular example shown in the central bridge functionality is deployed in an NMS . The aggregation point collects the MAC addresses of the end devices that are on the network as well as information about the switches .

In the example shown in for some of the end devices media information for each segment of physical media that connects each such end device to a switch is automatically read and communicated to an aggregation point . That is the end devices include an appropriate media reading interfaces and driver software to read media information that is stored on an ETHERNET cable connected to that end device and provide the media information for the ETHERNET cable as well the MAC address for the end device and its current IP address to an aggregation point . If the end device is connected to a switch via one or more intermediary devices such as a wall outlet and one or more patch panels each such intermediary device would include appropriate media reading interface functionality to read the media information and provide to the aggregation point . In this way the aggregation point would be able to associate the MAC address of each such end device with a port of the switch .

Also in the example shown in for some of the end devices media information for at least one segment of physical communication media that connects each such end device to a switch is not automatically read and communicated to an aggregation point . For these end devices physical layer information for each segment of physical communication media that connects the end devices to ports of the switch and the MAC addresses for the end devices can be manually entered and uploaded to the aggregation point as described above . Alternatively the central bridge functionality and or the aggregations point can obtain such information in other ways. For example the associations between the MAC addresses of the end devices and the ports of the switch can be learned from the NMS .

The central bridge functionality uses the physical layer information and MAC address information it has received to associate the MAC address for each end device with the port of the particular switch to which the end device is connected. Then the central bridge functionality determines a minimum spanning tree for the network using that information and determines a corresponding STP state typically blocking forwarding or disabled for each port of each switch . The central bridge functionality then determines how the forwarding database for each of the switches should be configured based on the spanning tree and the MAC address information the central bridge functionality has. The port state information and forwarding database information is then communicated to each of the switches .

Each of the switches includes corresponding bridge functionality to receive the port state information and forwarding database information from the central bridge functionality . The bridge functionality in each switch configures the switch so that each port is in the particular STP state specified by the central bridge functionality for it. Also the bridge functionality in each switch uses the forwarding database information it receives from the central bridge functionality to configure its forwarding database .

When changes occur to the network the aggregation point and or the other source of MAC address information such as the NMS will see the changes and provide updated information to the central bridge functionality . The central bridge functionality can modify the spanning tree topology if needed and determine what if any changes to each switch s port states and forwarding databases need to be made in response to the changes in the network .

By having the central bridge functionality determine the spanning tree for the network and configure the forwarding databases in the switches the switches need not perform such processing and instead the resources in the switch can be dedicated to forwarding packets. Also the central bridge functionality is able to directly learn of changes in the network from the aggregation point and quickly respond to such changes and communicate any needed changes to the switches . All of this should improve the performance of the network . Moreover the central bridge functionality because it has access to more information about the network can more effectively create the spanning tree for example by assembling the spanning tree based on the type number location length etc. of physical communication media used to implement the various logical communication links in the network .

The main difference between the system of and the system of is that in the system of the master processor unit and slave processor unit are combined together into a single combined master slave processor unit that is included in each patch panel . That is each patch panel includes the master processor unit unit functionality shown in for example each patent panel includes master processor and ETHERNET interface . Also each patch panel directly communicates with an appropriate aggregation point . As a result a backplane is not needed to communicate between the master processor unit functionality and the slave processor unit functionality.

The main difference between the system of and the system of is that the patch panels and the MPU communicate over a main bus using protocols specified in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.14.5 standard. Although the IEEE 802.14.5 protocols are typically used for wireless communications in the embodiment shown in the patch panels and MPU use the IEEE 802.14.5 protocols to communicate over one or more CATV coaxial cables.

In such an embodiment the main bus is physically implemented using one or more coaxial cables where the data communications are communicated along the coaxial cables in a suitable radio frequency band and where the MPU supplies DC power over the coaxial cables for use by the active components of each patch panel . The slave processor module in each patch panel includes a suitable bus interface shown in to couple the slave processor to the master processor module and the master processor unit includes a suitable bus interface shown in .

In such an embodiment the patch panel software and the main bus interfaces of each patch panel and the MPU software and the main bus interface of the MPU comprises suitable functionality to enable the programmable processor in each patch panel and the programmable processor in the MPU to send and receive data using the IEEE 802.14.5 protocol as well as connectors such as F connectors to connect each patch panel and the MPU to the coaxial cables used to implement the main bus via for example a tap or splitter . The addressing scheme of the IEEE 802.14.5 protocols supports up to 127 patch panels each patch panel supporting up to 48 ports for a total of 6096 ports and one MPU . The IEEE 802.14.5 protocols are designed for low power applications which is especially well suited for use in the embodiment shown in .

Also in the embodiment shown in power is supplied to each patch panel more specifically to the active components of each patch panel over the main bus . The PSU in the MPU converts the external power received from the external power source to power that is suitable for use by the components of the MPU and for supply to the patch panels .

The wall outlet is configured to be installed in or on a wall or similar structure. The wall outlet includes a set of ports similar to the ports described above in connection with . The ports are also referred to here as downstream ports . In general each downstream port includes a respective front connector or other attachment point in which a connectorized cable or other segment of physical media can be attached. An example of such a connectorized cable is a twisted pair cable having RJ 45 plugs at each end. Each downstream port also includes a rear attachment point that is connected to a corresponding port of a switch . The switch is used to communicatively couple each of the downstream ports to a patch panel not shown in over a single cable which is attached to the wall outlet via an upstream port . In one implementation of such an embodiment the upstream port is configured to be used with a non connectorized cable. This cable is typically routed through a building for example over under around and or through walls ceilings floors and the like and is typically not easily or frequently moved.

The switch includes a switching function that switches data packets among the downstream ports and the upstream port . The switching function is implemented for example in software hardware or combinations thereof.

The downstream ports of the wall outlet are configured to be used with connectorized cables that have media information stored in or on them for example as described above in connection with . The wall outlet includes a media reading interface for each downstream port . In this embodiment the media read interfaces are implemented in the same manner as the media reading interfaces described above in connection with . Each media reading interface is used to read the media information stored in or on the connectorized cable that is inserted into the corresponding downstream port . The media information that is read from the connectorized cables that are inserted into the downstream ports is communicated from the media reading interfaces to a programmable processor . In the embodiment shown in the programmable processor is a part of the switch .

The programmable processor executes software that is similar to the software that is executed by the programmable processors described above in connection with including for example a web server or other software that enables a user to interact with the processor . The main difference is that the programmable processor in the embodiment shown in communicates with a suitable aggregation point using the logical communication link that is provided using the upstream port . The wall outlet can be used to capture and communicate to a suitable aggregation point physical layer information related to the wall outlet itself the connectorized cables inserted into the downstream ports and the non connectorized cable attached to the upstream port .

As noted above the techniques described here for reading media information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media can be used in one or more end nodes of the network. For example computers such as laptops servers desktop computers or special purpose computing devices such as IP telephones IP multi media appliances and storage devices can be configured to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical communication media that are attached to its ports and to communicate the media information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the device itself to an aggregation point. is one embodiment of such a computer . The computer includes a network interface card NIC that is used to connect the computer to an IP network for example an ETHERNET local area network . The NIC includes a port that is used to physically attach a suitable cable for example a CAT 5 6 7 cable to the NIC . The NIC also includes standard NIC functionality for communicating over the IP network for example a suitable physical layer device PHY and media access control MAC device . The NIC enables one or more processors and the software executing thereon included in the computer to communicate with the IP network. In this embodiment the NIC includes a media reading interface that the one or more processors use to read media information stored on or in the cable that is attached to the computer . The media information that is read from the cable as well as information about the NIC and the computer for example any assigned MAC address or IP addresses can be communicated to a suitable aggregation point as described above. In one implementation of such an embodiment a NIC software driver used with the NIC includes physical layer information PLI functionality that causes the processor to read and communicate such physical layer information. The NIC and MRI are coupled to the processor using a suitable bus or other interconnect not shown . In this way information about the computer can be automatically obtained and used in the various applications described.

Functionality for reading media information stored in or on physical communication media can be integrated into one or more of the integrated circuits or other circuits or devices that communicate over the communication media. For example functionality for reading such media information can be integrated into an ETHERNET physical layer device used in a switch. One such example is shown in .

The PHY includes the required ETHERNET physical sublayers including a Physical Medium Dependent PMD sublayer which includes an appropriate transceiver for the physical communication media that are used with the switch a Physical Medium Attachment PMA sublayer which performs PMA framing octet synchronization detection and scrambling descrambling and a Physical Coding Sublayer PCS which performs auto negotiation and encoding decoding . The PHY also includes an appropriate Medium Independent Interface MII for example a Medium Independent Interface a Reduced Media Independent Interface RMII a Gigabit Media Independent Interface GMII and or a Serial Media Independent Interface SMII to connect the PHY to an ETHERNET media access control MAC device . As noted above in the particular exemplary embodiment shown in the PHY is designed for use in an ETHERNET switch and as a result the MAC is a switch MAC device that includes appropriate functionality to implement an ETHERNET switch.

The PHY typically also includes other standard ETHERNET physical layer functionality. For example the PHY includes management functionality for controlling and managing the PHY and a management data input output MDIO interface for communicating management information between the PHY and the MAC . Other standard ETHERNT physical functionality includes Medium Dependent Interface Cross Over MDIX functionality and clock functionality both of which are not shown in .

In the exemplary embodiment shown in each RJ 45 jack includes a media reading interface that can be used to determine if an RJ 45 plug is inserted into that RJ 45 jack and if one is to read the media information stored in an EEPROM attached to the RJ 45 plug if there is one . Example configurations of such a media interface and a suitable RJ 45 plug are described above and in the 395 application the 208 application and the 964 application.

In this embodiment a four line media reading interface is used. One line is used for communicating data using a serial data protocol one line is used for power and one line is used for ground. In this particular embodiment a fourth line is also provided for potential future possible uses or upgrades.

The PHY includes appropriate pins or other inputs for connecting to each of the eight media reading interfaces . The PHY also includes physical layer information PLI functionality that is coupled to the eight media reading interfaces .

In the particular exemplary embodiment shown in the PLI functionality is configured to provide the power and ground signals on the power and ground lines of each of the media reading interfaces . For example the PLI functionality in one implementation is connected to the main power input of the PHY in order to provide a suitable power signal on the power lines of each of the media reading interfaces . Also the PLI functionality is connected to the main ground input of the PHY in order to provide a connection to ground for each of the ground lines of the media reading interfaces .

In the particular exemplary embodiment shown in the PLI functionality is configured to monitor the eight media reading interfaces and determine when an RJ 45 plug has been inserted into each of the RJ 45 jacks . This can be done using the schemes described in the 395 application the 208 application and the 964 application. The PHY device includes one or more registers also referred to here as PLI registers in which the PLI functionality stores PLI related information. One byte of the PLI register also referred to here as the state byte is used to store information about the state of each of the eight jacks where each bit of the state byte represents the state of a respective one of the jacks . When the state of a particular jack changes that is when a plug is inserted into a previously empty jack or a plug is removed from a jack the PLI functionality is able to detect such change and change the state of the corresponding bit in the state byte stored the PLI registers .

The PLI functionality in the PHY device is also configured to when instructed to do so read the media information stored in an EEPROM if there is one attached to an RJ 45 plug that is inserted into a jack . Data that is read from the EEPROM is stored in the PLI registers of the PHY device . Also the PLI functionality is configured to when instructed to do so write data stored in the PLI registers to an EEPROM attached to an RJ 45 plug that is inserted into a jack .

In the particular exemplary embodiment shown in a host processor is coupled to the MAC device via an appropriate host interface. The host processor executes software also referred to here as the host software . The host software comprises program instructions that are stored or otherwise embodied on an appropriate storage medium or media from which at least a portion of the program instructions are read by the host processor for execution thereby.

In this exemplary embodiment the host processor includes a TCP IP stack and management software that implements various management and configuration related functionality for example a Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP agent and a web and or TELNET server by which a user can interact with the management software running on the switch .

In the exemplary embodiment shown in the host software also includes PLI software that is configured to communicate physical layer information associated with the switch and the cables connected to it to an aggregation point over the network to which the switch is connected. In one implementation of the switch the PLI software implements the protocols described above to participate in the discovery processing supported by the aggregation point and to send PLI to the aggregation point. Also in other implementations the PLI software interacts with an aggregation point solely using the API or other external interface technology that the aggregation point provides for application layer functionality to interact with it. In yet other implementations the PLI software interacts with the aggregation point via a NMS or other intermediary device or system for example using a protocol supported by the NMS such as SNMP .

The PLI software executing on the host processor periodically reads the state byte stored in the PLI registers in the PHY by instructing the MAC device via the host interface between the host processor and the MAC device to read the contents of the state byte via the MDIO interface between the MAC device and the PHY device .

When an RJ 45 plug is inserted into a jack the PLI software executing on the host processor will learn of that fact when it reads the state byte stored in the PLI registers of the PHY device . Then the PLI software causes via the host interface between the host processor and the MAC device the MAC device to instruct via the MDIO interface between the MAC device and the PHY device the PLI functionality in the PHY device to read the media information stored in the EEPROM if any attached to the newly inserted RJ 45 plug. The PLI functionality in the PHY device stores the media information it reads from the EEPROM in the PLI registers . Once this is complete the PLI software can obtain that media information by causing via the host interface between the host processor and the MAC device the MAC device to read via the MDIO interface between the MAC device and the PHY device the corresponding PLI registers in the PHY device . The media information read by the MAC device is then provided to the PLI software via the host interface. The PLI software can then communicate that information to an aggregation point as described above.

In addition to communicating PLI about the switch and any cables connected to the jacks of the switch the switch can also implement one or more of the inter networking features described above in connection with .

Another example of an ETHERNET physical layer device having integrated functionality for reading media information stored in or on physical communication media is shown in . is a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a computer that uses a physical layer device PHY that includes integrated functionality for reading media information. The functionality for reading media information stored in or on CAT 5 6 or 7 cables is integrated into the PHY in the same manner as described above in connection with . Accordingly elements of the computer that are substantially similar to corresponding elements described above in connection with are referenced in using the same text labels as used in and reference numerals with the same last two digits as those used in .

One difference between the PHY of and the PHY of is in the number ETHERNET ports supported. The PHY of supports a single ETHERNET port. Also the MAC device of is a MAC device suitable for use in an end node device such as a computer . Likewise the software executing on the host processor is software that is typically executed by an end user computer .

Although illustrate particular examples of how functionality for reading media information stored on or in physical communication medium can be integrated into one or more of the integrated circuits or other circuits or devices that communicate over the communication media it is to be understood that such media reading functionality can be integrated in other ways.

In other embodiments media information is stored in or on unconnectorized cables or other physical communication media. For example in one such embodiment storage devices are attached near each end of the unconnecterized cable so that when each end of the cable is attached to a respective attachment point an interface for a respective one of the storage devices mates with a corresponding media reading interface located on or near the attachment point so the information stored in the storage device can be read from the storage device in a similar manner as is described above. Such embodiments can include punch down connections for connecting copper twisted pair cables to the rear sides of RJ jacks or to Krone type blocks that include Insulation Displacement Connectors IDC s .

In the embodiment shown in a storage device for example an EEPROM or other non volatile memory device is mounted on the outer surface of the top wall of the molded flexible circuit . The storage device interface for mating with a media reading interface comprises a set of conductive leads that are formed on the outer surface of the top wall and extend down the outer surface of both side walls . At least a portion of the leads are exposed that is do not have an insulator formed over them so that corresponding contacts from a media reading interface can come into contact with the leads when the plug around which the jacket is attached is inserted into a port. In such an embodiment the contacts of the media reading interface can be spring loaded into order to press against the leads in order to form a good electrical contact. The media reading interface can then be used to read the information stored in the storage device in the manner described above.

Also in this embodiment an infra red emitter is mounted on the outer surface of the top wall . The infra red emitter is configured to emit an infra red signal on which at least a portion of the information stored in the storage device is encoded. In one implementation the infra red emitter is configured to output this infra red signal with the information encoded thereon whenever the storage device is read using the media reading interface. The jacket is configured so that a technician can position an infra red detector near the infra read emitter in order to receive the infra red signal that is emitted. The infra red detector can be coupled to for example a hand held unit that decodes the received infra red signal and displays the information that was encoded on the infra red signal. In this way a technician can view the information that is stored in the storage device without requiring the RJ 45 plug to be removed from a port. This embodiment can be adapted for other connector types including fiber optic connectors.

The PLI information that is captured maintained and made available using the techniques described here can be used for many different types of applications. For example the PLI information can be used in managing the amount of slack that is associated with each media segment in the system. When a new patch cord or other media segment is needed to be installed in the network the physical layer information that has been captured can be used to determine a precise and appropriate length for the patch cord based on the PLI and the particular slack management policies that are used by the enterprise or carrier. Also such PLI can be used to assist with public safety applications for example to help to locate devices that are used in a voice over Internet Protocol VOIP telephony system .

Examples of how such physical layer information can be used include the following. For example a NMS or other user interface associated with the aggregation point or any connector assembly such as patch panel or when displaying information about a particular segment of physical media can also be configured to automatically send the user to a web site via which the user can order a replacement for that particular media segment. For example a Web browser based user interface can be configured to display a button or other user interface element that a user can click on in order to automatically bring up a web site via which a replacement segment can be ordered. Similar functionality can be included in the user interfaces that are displayed by the aggregation points and connector assemblies for example by the web servers that execute on the aggregation points and the connector assemblies for example patch panels or .

In another example when a particular lot of physical communication media segments is recalled for example due to safety or performance concerns the physical layer information that is obtained in the manner described here can be used to determine if and where any of the recalled segments of physical media are deployed in the network. This information can be used in determining whether to replace the segment and or can be used in actually replacing the segment.

In another example the physical layer information described here is used for intrusion detection. For example for particular secure resources on a network for example a particular server or service a security policy can be established that specifies that the secure resources should only be accessed by specific computers that are coupled to the secure resource using particular ports of particular inter networking devices or other connector assemblies and particular segments of physical communication media. If someone attempts to access the secure resources in a manner that does not comply with the security policy he or she is not granted access to the secure resources. For example if an intruder were able to spoof the identify of an authorized computer but accessed the secure resource using an unauthorized logical communication link the intruder would still be denied access to the secure resource unless the intruder is able to spoof the identities of all of the other elements identified in the policy for example the identities of all the physical communication media that implement the logical communication link between the computer and the secure resource .

In another example the aggregation point receives and store information about certain conditions that exist in various locations in which the physical communication media is deployed. For example the aggregation point can be configured to receive and store information that is unique to each location such as local requirements concerning the use of battery backups environmental conditions obtained from external sensors and external systems such as external temperature sensors HVAC systems or computer servers that provide weather related information . Routing decisions within the network can then be made at least in part based on such locally unique conditions.

In another example a technician near a particular patch panel may want to swap out a particular patch cord for example because a visual inspection of the patch cord identified some potential issue with the patch cord . A request for clearance to disconnect the patch cord from the associated port would be routed to an aggregation point or a NMS. The aggregation point or NMS would send messages to one or more relevant inter networking devices indicating that a patch cord used to implement a particular logical communication link is going to be disconnected in the near future. The inter networking devices in response to such a signal would route certain classes of traffic for example real time traffic such as telephony or multimedia traffic away from that logical communication link. Also the inter networking devices can be configured to communicate an all clear signal back to the aggregation point or NMS which indicates that it is okay from the perspective of each such device to disconnect the relevant patch cord. When the aggregation point or NMS receives all clear signals from all the notified inter networking devices the aggregation point or NMS informs the technician using the display that it is okay to disconnect that patch cord.

In another example the physical layer information obtained using the techniques described here is used to check if a particular type of physical communication media has been installed. For example where an enterprise or carrier wishes to deploy a particular type of physical communication media for a given logical communication link for example CAT 6 compatible physical communication media to implement GIGABIT ETHERNET communication links the physical layer information that is obtained as described above can be used to confirm that each physical communication media segment of the logical communication link has been implemented using the appropriate type of physical communication media. Another example is to confirm that multi mode fiber or shielded twisted pair cabling has been deployed instead of single mode fiber or unshielded twisted pair cabling respectively which may not be readily apparent from a visual inspection of the communication media when installed.

In another example the physical layer information obtained using the techniques described here is used for theft monitoring. For example in the case of IP telephony the IP telephony server can be configured to deliver telephony service to each IP phone only if that IP phone is used with particular logical communication links implemented using particular physical layer elements for example segments deployed within a given building . If the IP phone is stolen or moved outside of any authorized area the IP telephony server does not provide service to the IP phone even if it is able to access the IP telephony server.

The techniques described here can be used in a variety of applications including enterprise applications and carrier applications.

The portion of the network that is closest to central office is generally referred to as the F1 region where F1 is the feeder fiber from the central office . The portion of the network closest to the end users can be referred to as an F2 portion of network . The network includes a plurality of break out locations at which branch cables are separated out from the main cable lines. Branch cables are often connected to drop terminals that include connector interfaces for facilitating coupling of the fibers of the branch cables to a plurality of different subscriber locations .

Splitters used in an FDH can accept a feeder cable F1 having a number of fibers and may split those incoming fibers into for example 216 to 432 individual distribution fibers that may be associated with a like number of end user locations. In typical applications an optical splitter is provided prepackaged in an optical splitter module housing and provided with a splitter output in pigtails that extend from the module. The splitter output pigtails are typically connectorized with for example SC LC or LX.5 connectors. The optical splitter module provides protective packaging for the optical splitter components in the housing and thus provides for easy handling for otherwise fragile splitter components. This modular approach allows optical splitter modules to be added incrementally to FDHs as required.

The FDH generally administers connections at a termination panel between incoming fiber and outgoing fiber in an Outside Plant OSP environment. As the term is used herein a connection between fibers includes both direct and indirect connections. Examples of incoming fibers include the feeder cable fibers that enter the cabinet and intermediate fibers for example connectorized pigtails extending from splitters and patching fibers jumpers that connect the feeder cable fiber to the termination panel. Examples of outgoing fibers include the subscriber cable fibers that exit the cabinet and any intermediate fibers that connect the subscriber cable fibers to the termination panel. The FDH provides an interconnect interface for optical transmission signals at a location in the network where operational access and reconfiguration are desired. For example as noted above the FDH can be used to split the feeder cables and terminate the split feeder cables to distribution cables routed to subscriber locations. In addition the FDH is designed to accommodate a range of alternative sizes and fiber counts and support factory installation of pigtails fanouts and splitters.

As shown at a feeder cable is initially routed into the FDH through a cabinet . In certain embodiments the fibers of the feeder cable can include ribbon fibers. An example feeder cable may include twelve to forty eight individual fibers connected to a service provider central office . In some embodiments after entering the cabinet the fibers of the feeder cable are routed to a feeder cable interface for example fiber optic adapter modules a splice tray etc. . At the feeder cable interface one or more of the fibers of the feeder cable are individually connected to separate splitter input fibers . The splitter input fibers are routed from the feeder cable interface to the splitter module housing . At the splitter module housing the splitter input fibers are connected to separate splitter modules wherein the input fibers are each split into multiple pigtails each having connectorized ends . In other embodiments however the fibers of the feeder cable can be connectorized and can be routed directly to the splitter modules thereby bypassing or eliminating the need for an intermediate feeder cable interface .

When the pigtails are not in service the connectorized ends can be temporarily stored on a storage module that is mounted at the storage region of the cabinet . When the pigtails are needed for service the pigtails are routed from the splitter modules to a termination module that is provided at the termination region of the cabinet . At the termination module the pigtails are connected to the fibers of a distribution cable . The termination panel is the dividing line between the incoming fibers and the outgoing fibers. A typical distribution cable forms the F2 portion of a network see and typically includes a plurality of fibers for example 144 216 or 432 fibers that are routed from the FDH to subscriber locations . Cables with connectorized ends connect to the connectorized ends of the pigtails at fiber optic adapters .

In some embodiments one or more of the fibers of the feeder cable are not connected to any of the splitter modules . Rather these fibers of the feeder cable are connected to pass through fibers having connectorized ends . The pass through fibers are connected to the termination modules without first connecting to the splitter modules . By refraining from splitting a fiber a stronger signal can be sent to one of the subscribers. The connectorized ends of the pass through fibers can be stored at the storage region when not in use. Cables with connectorized ends connect to the connectorized ends of the pass through fibers at the fiber optic adapters . The feeder interface device includes connections for connecting the various cables such as with splices or connectorized ends and adapters like connectorized ends and and adapters noted above.

The various segments of physical communication media that are used in the network of can have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. For example the various connectorized fibers described above in connection with can be outfitted with storage devices and the corresponding termination modules and other attachment points can include corresponding media reading interfaces to read at least a portion of the identifier and attribute information stored in each of the storage devices. The identifier and attribute information that is read from the storage devices can be communicated to an aggregation point for use as described herein using a suitable communication link such as a wireless or wired communication link . Other physical layer information for example information about the termination modules spliters cabinets and other devices in the network and information about the locations in which they are deployed can also be provided to such an aggregation point for use thereby.

In another example the physical layer information obtained using the techniques described here is used by a telecommunications carrier to assist fulfilling service level agreements. For example as noted above the physical layer information can be used to determine if a given logical communication link has been implemented using appropriate physical communication media for example CAT 6 cabling in ETHERNET in the First Mile EFM applications or the appropriate type of fiber . This may be especially important at the demarcation point between the telecommunication carrier s equipment and the customer s equipment. Also physical layer information can be used to determine if unauthorized changes have been made at the demarcation point.

In another example the physical layer information obtained using the techniques described here is used by a telecommunications carrier to implement differentiated service levels. For example where certain customers require their communications traffic to travel through certain geographic regions for example to comply with export control laws a carrier can use the physical layer information obtained using the techniques described here to route the customers traffic in compliance with the customers requirements. In another example each routing point site building etc. is assigned a security score and certain communication traffic is routed only through routing points sites buildings etc. that have a security score at or above a certain level.
