This application claims the benefit of prior U.S. provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 215 966 filed May 5 2009 by David P. Ziegler Christopher P. Drew and Michelle Markey.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to an assembly and method for evaluating the performance and effectiveness of anti fog products applied to eyewear lenses.

It is known to test ski goggles to measure the time for light transmission though the goggle to decrease. As condensation forms on the inner surfaces of the goggles and scatters light passed therethrough the light transmission through the goggles decreases.

A current test method includes placing eyewear goggles lenses horizontally on a heated water bath. A collimated laser beam is passed through the lens and a photosensor is used to measure the time for the light transmission to decrease by a selected degree as condensation forms on the inner surfaces of the lenses and scatters the light.

The test has been found wanting inasmuch as real eyewear is worn in a generally vertical position on a user s face and the test does not account for airflow between the user s face and the eyewear frame. Further the test does not factor in the fact that other headwear such as hats or helmets can interfere with airflow and the test does not capture the dynamic nature of the fogging event.

Accordingly there is a need for an improved test for the efficacy of anti fog coatings on eyewear lenses.

An object of the invention is therefore the provision of an assembly for testing the effectiveness of anti fog coatings applied to eyewear lenses.

A further object of the invention is the provision of a method for evaluating the effectiveness of anti fog coatings on eyewear lenses.

In accordance with the above and other objects there is provided herein an assembly for testing the effectiveness of anti fog coatings applied to eyewear lenses the assembly comprising an insulated chamber adapted to receive support and retain eyewear having lenses mounted thereon the lenses having an anti fog coating thereon means for controlling the temperature and relative humidity of atmosphere in the chamber means for providing a stream of warm moist air to the chamber and directed at the lenses and a hazemeter for detecting and recording percentages of haze values over a selected period of time.

In accordance with the above and other objects there is further provided herein a method for evaluating the effectiveness of anti fogging coatings on eyewear lenses the method including the steps of providing an environmentally controlled test chamber having mounted thereon eyewear having lenses with anti fog coatings thereon cooling the interior of the test chamber to about 10 C. 12 C. effecting a relative humidity of less that 30 in the test chamber subjecting the rear sides of the lenses to a stream of warm moist air and measuring per cent haze values over a selected time period.

Reference is made to the accompanying drawing in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent.

Referring to it will be seen that the assembly for evaluating the effectiveness of anti fog coatings on eyewear lenses includes a test chamber which is adapted to be closed and for the interior thereof to be environmentally controlled.

An anatomically accurate headform is mounted on a bottom portion of the chamber which in turn is mounted on a supporting surface . The headform is configured to anatomically correspond to a selected human headform such as for example a selected size and configuration of a human male or female and is adapted to receive eyewear similarly to the manner in which a human head receives and retains eyewear such as spectacles goggles a face shield and the like provided with an anti fog coating on the lens portions thereof. The headform may be formed of a nylon material.

The test assembly further includes means for effecting and controlling the temperature and relative humidity of the atmosphere within the chamber . The atmosphere preferably is maintained at a temperature of 10 C. 12 C. and a relative humidity of less than 30 . The temperature and humidity control means may be a closed liquid cooling system including a chilled water circulator disposed outside the chamber least but communicating with the temperature and humidity control unit by way of a tube .

The assembly further includes means for providing a stream of warm moist air to the chamber and in particular directed to the rear side of the eyewear that is between the eyewear and the headform face portion by a delivery tube .

The assembly further includes a hazemeter disposed in the chamber for detecting and recording percentages of haze values over a selected period of time. Hazemeter is in communication with a detector disposed adjacent a rearward opening of a light transmission means such as one or more tunnels extending from an area of the headform behind the eyewear being tested.

In an alternative embodiment not shown in the drawings the hazemeter may be mounted within the headform.

In operation the headform is mounted in the test chamber and the test chamber is closed. The eyewear to be tested is mounted on the headform . The atmosphere within the test chamber is set and maintained at a selected temperature and humidity by the temperature and humidity control unit which in supplied with chilled water from the circulator by way of the tube .

The temperature and humidity control unit is energized to maintain the atmosphere within the chamber at a temperature of about 10 C. 12 C. and to maintain the relative humidity within the chamber at less than 30 .

A flow of warm moist air is directed from the unit to the area in the chamber between the eyewear and the face portion of the headform . Thus the rear portions of the eyewear are maintained in a warm moist condition while the front portions of the eyewear are maintained cold and moist.

As the eyewear fogs up the fogging is detected by the detector which is exposed to light transmission through the eyewear and through the light transmission means typically a tunnel extending through the headform . The light detector conveys light transmission data to the hazemeter which stores pertinent data relative to the extent of fogging of the eyewear.

There is thus provided an assembly and method by which the benefit of an anti fogging lens or anti fogging coating for a lens may be tested and evaluated.

It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular constructions herein disclosed and or shown in the drawing but also comprises any modifications or equivalents within the scope of the claims.
