The invention relates in general to large caliber gun tubes and in particular to the evacuation of propellant gas from such tubes.

Modem armored vehicles such as tanks and self propelled howitzers generally have a large caliber gun as the main armament. The breech of the gun may be located within a manned closed cab vehicle. After firing a round residual propellant gases in the gun must be evacuated from the bore to prevent them from entering the cab of the vehicle. Propellant gases may contain noxious components such as carbon monoxide nitric acid and ammonia. If the propellant gases enter the vehicle compartment they may pose a hazard to the crew. In addition the fuel rich propellant gases may spontaneously combust known as flareback when they contact the air in the cab. Various means of purging propellant gases from the bores of guns have been developed and used over the years.

A conventional approach to this problem has been the integration of a reservoir alternatively called a bore evacuator or a fume extractor located approximately mid bore and tapped into the bore by a series of ports angled towards the muzzle. During the firing cycle propellant gases enter the angled ports and charge the reservoir to approximately 100 psi. After firing the round the pressure in the bore drops to atmospheric the process reverses itself and gases begin to discharge back into the bore through the angled ports. The action of this process is such that when the breech is opened air from the cab is entrained at the breech into the bore and the residual propellant gases are ejected out the muzzle. Because this process happens very rapidly the entire cycle lasts approximately one second the timing of the breech opening is crucial to performance.

Armored systems which use bore evacuators or fume extractors are recognizable by the characteristic reservoir located approximately mid bore of the main armament. Such systems are advantageous because of their passive operation and can be very effective if properly maintained. However there are some deficiencies in the conventional evacuators.

To be effective such a system must be able to operate over a rather wide range of propellant charge pressures. In tank guns the system must be capable of effectively evacuating the bore with standard high pressure rounds as well as newer low pressure rounds. Artillery systems typically also use varying charge zones which can vary over an order of magnitude in pressure.

In addition the trend towards lighter weight guns necessitates longer recoil and hence delayed breech opening. Delayed breech opening limits effectiveness of the conventional evacuator. The conventional bore evacuator must be significantly over designed to properly function under a wide variety of conditions. Consequently conventional evacuators may be complicated heavy devices that may add undue weight to the weapon system adversely affect the center of gravity of the vehicle or system and require maintenance. The location of the bore evacuator external to the vehicle also makes them vulnerable to damage. A single puncture from small arms fire shrapnel or impact can render the bore evacuator non functional. For effective operation such systems may require cleaning and maintenance after each firing day.

A need exists for a bore evacuator that is more efficient over a range of propellant charge pressures less vulnerable to damage and requires less maintenance than a conventional bore evacuator.

It is an object of the invention to provide a gun scavenger that is efficient over a wide range of propellant charge pressures is less vulnerable to damage than conventional bore evacuators and requires little maintenance.

One aspect of the invention is a recoil actuated gun scavenger for a gun having a bore a breech a recoiling mass and a non recoiling mass. The scavenger may include a pneumatic cylinder having a piston disposed therein. The cylinder and the piston may be translatable with respect to each other. The cylinder may be fixed to one of the recoiling mass and the non recoiling mass. A rod may have one end fixed to the piston and another end fixed to another of the recoiling mass and the non recoiling mass.

The scavenger may include a pair of air intake ports in the cylinder and a pair of air exhaust ports in the cylinder. The pair of intake ports may be disposed on opposite sides of the piston. Each intake port may include a one way valve. The pair of air exhaust ports may be disposed on opposite sides of the piston. Each exhaust port may include a one way valve. An air accumulator may be in fluid communication with the pair of exhaust ports. A discharge valve may be in fluid communication with the air accumulator. The discharge valve may have an open position and a closed position.

At least one jet may be disposed at a breech end of the bore of the gun. The at least one jet may be in fluid communication with the discharge valve. Air that is compressed into the accumulator by the piston may be discharged from the at least one jet into the breech end of the bore when the breech of the gun opens. The piston may compress air into the accumulator on both recoil and counter recoil strokes.

The discharge valve may be disposed on the non recoiling mass. The discharge valve may open and close by relative translation of the recoiling mass and the non recoiling mass. The discharge valve may be closed when the gun is out of battery and open when the gun is in battery. The recoiling mass may open the discharge valve by contact. The discharge valve may be spring biased to the closed position.

In one embodiment the accumulator may be a single chamber accumulator. In another embodiment the accumulator may include two chambers separated by a movable accumulator piston.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A gun scavenger may utilize the recoil action of a weapon to compress a quantity of air. The compressed air may be delivered to the gun bore through jets located at the breech end of the gun. The compressed air may effectively purge the gun bore of residual propellant gases.

Cylinder may include a pair of air exhaust ports . Exhaust ports may be disposed on opposite sides of piston . Each exhaust port may include a one way valve .

An air accumulator may be in fluid communication with exhaust ports . A discharge valve may be in fluid communication with air accumulator . Discharge valve may have open and closed positions. Discharge valve may be in fluid communication with jets . Jets may be disposed at breech end of gun bore . Scavenger may include at least one jet or a plurality of jets . Ambient air compressed into accumulator by piston may be discharged from jets into breech end of gun bore when breech opens.

Piston may compress air into accumulator on both recoil and counter recoil strokes. Discharge valve may be disposed on non recoiling mass . Discharge valve may be opened and closed by relative translation of recoiling mass and non recoiling mass . Discharge valve may be closed when gun tube is out of battery. As the gun tube returns to battery discharge valve may open to allow air in accumulator to enter jets . Compressed air may exit jets into breech end and force residual propellant gases in bore out of the muzzle of tube .

In one embodiment discharge valve may be disposed on non recoiling mass and recoiling mass may open discharge valve by contact. Discharge valve may include a spring that biases valve to the closed position.

Accumulator may be a single chamber constant volume accumulator. Alternatively as shown in an accumulator with two chambers may be used. Chambers may be separated by a movable piston . A constant pressure gas reservoir may be in fluid communication with accumulator chamber . Constant pressure gas reservoir may contain an inert gas such as nitrogen. To maintain substantially constant pressure in accumulator the volume of reservoir may be greater than the volume of accumulator for example five to ten times greater.

Accumulator may pre charged via reservoir to a determined pre charge pressure. During the discharge cycle air may be forced at substantially constant pressure by the action of piston through jets . Thus accumulator may allow scavenger to operate at lower pressures and more efficiently than accumulator .
