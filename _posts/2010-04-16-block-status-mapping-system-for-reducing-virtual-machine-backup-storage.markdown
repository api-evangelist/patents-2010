title: Block status mapping system for reducing virtual machine backup storage
abstract: Systems and methods programmatically determine the status of blocks in a virtual machine image. In certain embodiments, the system can determine which blocks are active, deleted, zero, or a combination of the same. In certain embodiments, the system advantageously determines block status without scanning all the blocks in a virtual machine image. Instead, the system can access metadata in a file system of a virtual machine image to determine the block status. When backing up the virtual machine image, the system can back up active blocks while skipping inactive blocks, including deleted and/or zero blocks. As a result, the system can take less time to back up a virtual machine image, and the resulting backup file or files can consume less storage space.

This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 170 520 filed on Apr. 17 2009 and entitled Systems and Methods for Mapping Virtual Machine Data the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Many companies take advantage of virtualization solutions to consolidate several specialized physical servers and workstations into fewer servers running virtual machines. Each virtual machine can be configured with its own set of virtual hardware e.g. processor memory ports and the like such that specialized services that each of the previous physical machines performed can be run in their native operating system. For example a virtualization layer or hypervisor can allocate the computing resources of one or more host servers into one or more virtual machines and can further provide for isolation between such virtual machines. In such a manner the virtual machine can be a representation of a physical machine by software.

In many virtual machine implementations each virtual machine is associated with at least one virtual machine disk or image located in one or more files in a data store. The virtual machine image can include files associated with a file system of a guest operating system. The virtual machine image can be copied moved backed up or the like similar to a general data file.

In certain embodiments systems and methods programmatically determine the status of blocks in a virtual machine image. For example a system can determine which blocks in a virtual machine image are active deleted zero or a combination of the same. The system can determine block status without scanning all the blocks in a virtual machine image in some implementations. Instead the system can access metadata in a file system of a virtual machine image to determine the block status. When backing up the virtual machine image the system can back up active blocks while skipping inactive blocks including deleted and or zero blocks. As a result in certain embodiments the system can take less time to back up a virtual machine image and the resulting backup file or files can consume less storage space.

For purposes of summarizing the disclosure certain aspects advantages and novel features of the inventions have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages can be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the inventions disclosed herein. Thus the inventions disclosed herein can be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as can be taught or suggested herein.

Virtual machine images often contain a large percentage of white space which includes empty blocks zero blocks . A backup of an entire virtual machine image therefore stores the white space together with any active and deleted blocks wasting storage space and backup time. Some solutions determine which blocks of a virtual machine image are zero blocks and then back up only the active and deleted blocks. This backup approach is called zero handling. A drawback of zero handling is that a full scan of the blocks is performed to determine which blocks are the zero blocks. The full scan can take a significant amount of time. Another drawback of this approach is that zero handling fails to account for blocks of a file system that are marked as deleted. Thus even when accounting for zero blocks a backup system can still back up a significant amount of irrelevant deleted data which still results in wasted storage space and backup time.

This disclosure describes systems and methods for programmatically determining the status of blocks in a virtual machine image. In certain embodiments the system can determine which blocks are active deleted zero or a combination of the same. In certain embodiments the system advantageously determines block status without scanning some or all the blocks in a virtual machine image. Instead the system can access metadata in a file system of a virtual machine image to determine the block status. When backing up the virtual machine image the system can back up active blocks while skipping inactive blocks including deleted and or zero blocks. As a result the system can take less time to back up a virtual machine image and the resulting backup file or files can consume less storage space.

As shown in the backup system includes a host server in communication with a data store . In certain embodiments the host server includes one or more computing devices configured to host one or more virtual machines executing on top of a hypervisor . In certain embodiments the hypervisor decouples the physical hardware of the host server from the operating system s of the virtual machine s . Such abstraction allows for example for multiple virtual machines with different operating systems and applications to run in isolation or substantially in isolation on the same physical machine.

The hypervisor includes a virtualization platform that allows for multiple operating systems to run on a host computer at the same time. For instance the hypervisor can include a thin piece of software that runs directly on top of the hardware platform of the host server and that virtualizes resources of the machine e.g. a native or bare metal hypervisor . In such embodiments the virtual machine s can run with their respective operating systems on the hypervisor without the need for a host operating system. Examples of such bare metal hypervisors can include but are not limited to ESX SERVER by VMware Inc. Palo Alto Calif. XEN and XENSERVER by Citrix Systems Inc. Fort Lauderdale Fla. ORACLE VM by Oracle Corporation Redwood City Calif. HYPER V by Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. VIRTUOZZO by Parallels Inc. Switzerland or the like.

In yet other embodiments the host server can include a hosted architecture in which the hypervisor runs within a host operating system environment. In such embodiments the hypervisor can rely on the host operating system for device support and or physical resource management. Examples of such hosted hypervisors can include but are not limited to VMWARE WORKSTATION and VMWARE SERVER by VMware Inc. VIRTUAL SERVER by Microsoft Corporation PARALLELS WORKSTATION by Parallels Inc. or the like.

In certain embodiments each virtual machine includes a guest operating system and associated applications. In such embodiments the virtual machine accesses the resources e.g. privileged resources of the host server through the hypervisor . At least some of the machines can also include a backup service in certain embodiments which can assist with backup operations as described below.

The host server communicates with the data store to access data stored in one or more virtual machine files. For instance the data store can include one or more virtual machine file systems that maintain virtual disk files or virtual machine images for some or all of the virtual machines on the host server . In certain embodiments the virtual machine file system includes a VMWARE VMFS cluster file system provided by VMware Inc. In such embodiments the VMFS cluster file system enables multiple host servers e.g. with installations of ESX server to have concurrent access to the same virtual machine storage and provides on disk distributed locking to ensure that the same virtual machine is not powered on by multiple servers at the same time. In other embodiments the virtual machine file system is stored on the host server instead of in a separate data store.

The data store can include any physical or logical storage for holding virtual machine files. The data store can exist on a physical storage resource including one or more of the following local disks e.g. local small computer system interface SCSI disks of the host server a disk array a storage area network SAN e.g. fiber channel an iSCSI disk area network attached storage NAS arrays network file system NFS or the like. In certain embodiments the virtual machine s uses a virtual disk file or virtual machine image residing on the data store to store its operating system program files and other data associated with its activities.

The backup system further includes a management server in communication with the host server over a network . In certain embodiments the management server includes one or more computing devices. The management server can coordinate the backup operations of the virtual machine disk files through the host server . In one embodiment the management server causes the backup service of the virtual machine to perform certain backup operations. For example the backup service can perform shadow copy or snapshot operations such as are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 182 364 filed Jul. 30 2008 titled Systems and Methods for Performing Backup Operations of a Virtual Machine the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition the backup system can include additional features described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 502 052 filed Jul. 13 2009 titled Backup Systems and Methods for a Virtual Computing Environment the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Advantageously in certain embodiments the management server analyzes the virtual disk files to identify the status of portions of the virtual disk files to determine whether these portions include active deleted and or zero data. The management server can identify the status of these disk file portions efficiently by accessing metadata within the virtual disk file . The management server can then initiate a backup of the active portions of the virtual disk file .

The management server analyzes the virtual disk file in certain embodiments outside of the virtual machine for example outside of a guest operating system of the virtual machine . The management server can therefore reduce the impact of backup operations on the virtual machine . Alternatively in certain embodiments a component operating within the virtual machine can perform this analysis such as an application executing in the virtual machine . For instance the management server can inject a lightweight binary file into the virtual machine executing on the host. On WINDOWS systems for example the management server can inject the binary using Windows Management Instrumentation WMI features. The binary file can then analyze the virtual disk file . Additional features of the management server are described in greater detail below with respect to .

As further illustrated in the backup system includes a backup or target server for storing backup files such as a backup of one or more of the virtual disk files . As shown the backup server is coupled to the network and can directly communicate with the management server . The management server can cause backups of virtual disk files to be stored in the backup server .

As shown the network provides a wired and or wireless communication medium between the host server the management server and or the backup server . In certain embodiments the network includes a local area network LAN . In yet other embodiments the network includes one or more of the following Internet intranet wide area network WAN public network combinations of the same or the like.

Although the backup system has been described with reference to particular arrangements other embodiments can comprise more or fewer components. For example in certain embodiments the backup system can function without the backup server and backup files can be stored to the data store or a local storage device directly coupled to the management server or host system .

In yet other embodiments the host server can comprise a plurality of servers in a clustered arrangement such that the computing and memory resources of the clustered servers are shared by one or more virtual machines . Moreover in certain embodiments the backup tool maintained by the management server can instead reside on the host server and or the backup server .

In the depicted embodiment the management server includes a backup module a mapping module and a user interface module . Each of these modules can be implemented in hardware and or software. In certain embodiments the backup module coordinates backup operations of virtual disk files stored in the data store . The backup module can perform for example full backups differential backups incremental backups or the like. The backup module can coordinate with the backup service within the virtual machine to perform virtual disk snapshots in the manner described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 182 364 referred to above. However in some embodiments the backup module performs backup operations without coordinating with a backup service inside the virtual machine .

The mapping module can determine status information about a virtual disk file . In the context of VMWARE systems for instance the mapping module can access a .VMDK virtual disk file . In one embodiment the backup module invokes the mapping module prior to backing up the virtual disk file . Status information determined by the mapping module can include information on which portions of the virtual disk file include active or inactive data. Active data can include data that is currently used by the virtual machine . For example active data can include non deleted and non zero data. In contrast inactive data can include deleted data or zero empty data. Some guest operating systems merely mark data as deleted when a user deletes the data rather than actually erasing the data from storage. Thus the deleted data can include actual data that has been marked as deleted.

The mapping module can determine the status information about the virtual disk file by accessing a guest operating system file system stored within the file . The file system includes files such as guest operating system files application files user documents and so on. Metadata in the file system describes the logical structure of the files including the locations of the files in a logical hierarchy such as a directory tree. In addition the metadata can specify the physical structure of the files such as the locations of the files in the virtual disk file the size of the files and so on.

Different guest operating systems can include different file systems. For example many WINDOWS operating systems use the NTFS file system whereas LINUX systems use a different file system. While file systems from different operating systems are implemented differently most file systems share the common characteristic of using metadata to describe the structure of the files. In certain embodiments the mapping module can determine status information from many different types of files systems .

Advantageously in certain embodiments the mapping module accesses the metadata to determine the status information. Accessing the metadata can be faster than scanning or reading some or all of the file system to determine status information because the metadata can include a summary or description of the status information. In one embodiment the metadata for a WINDOWS based NTFS file system can include a header file called a Master File Table MFT . The MFT can be organized as a database table or tables with each row in the table or tables representing one file. Data about the files stored in the MFT can include information such as file permissions ownership size location and status of data blocks of the file. The mapping module can therefore access the MFT to obtain the status information for portions of the file system. In contrast the metadata in many LINUX and UNIX based systems include an inode or vnode for some or all of the files. The inodes or vnodes are data structures that can include file permissions ownership size location and status of data blocks of the file. Thus in LINUX or UNIX based systems the mapping module can access the inodes or vnodes to obtain status information for portions of the file system.

Different implementations of the mapping module can analyze the metadata at different levels of granularity. In one implementation the mapping module determines the status of storage blocks of the file system from the metadata . In another embodiment the mapping module determines the status of the files of the file system . In yet another embodiment the mapping module determines the status of directories of the file system . For ease of illustration the remainder of this specification will refer to determining the status of blocks in the file system . However it should be understood that the various features described herein can apply to any type of metadata mapped by the mapping module .

Advantageously in certain embodiments the mapping module can store the status information about blocks or other storage units in a virtual disk map on the backup server or on another device e.g. in a memory . The virtual disk map can be a data structure or the like that includes some indication of the status of some or all of the blocks in the file system . The virtual disk map can advantageously consume far less storage than the data in the virtual disk file because the map represents the data but does not include the actual data. For example the virtual disk map can be a bitmap a bytemap or some other data structure. Various features of the virtual disk map will be described in greater detail below with respect to .

When backing up the virtual disk file the backup module can consult the virtual disk map to determine which blocks of the file system are active or inactive. The backup module can then save the active blocks in a backup virtual disk file . An embodiment of a backup process used by the backup module is described below with respect to .

The user interface module of the management server can provide functionality for users to control settings of the backup module and or the mapping module . For instance the user interface module can provide a scheduling user interface that allows an administrator to schedule backups of the virtual disk file . In one embodiment the user interface module also provides an interface to enable or disable the functions of the mapping module . An administrator may wish to disable the mapping module because in some embodiments undelete operations cannot be performed on the backup virtual disk file when deleted blocks are not saved in the file . The user interface module can also allow an administrator to enable some functionality of the mapping module while disabling others. For example a user interface might allow an administrator to enable zero block removal to reduce backup size while disabling deleted block removal to allow for undelete operations.

At state a map of active and or inactive blocks of a guest operating system file system are created. The map created can be the virtual disk map described above with respect to and can be created by the mapping module . The map can include an indication of which blocks are active which blocks are inactive or both. Further inactive blocks can be broken down to include deleted blocks and zero blocks which can be separately indicated in the map. The map is stored in computer storage at state for example by the mapping module . The mapping module can persist the map or can store the map in memory see .

For some or all of the blocks in the file system at state the map is accessed to determine whether the block or blocks are active or inactive. In one embodiment state is implemented by the backup module at the start of a backup operation. At decision state it is determined whether the block is active or inactive. The backup module can access a value for the block stored in the map for instance which indicates whether the block is active or inactive. If the block is active the block is backed up at state . Otherwise the block is skipped not backed up at state . In another embodiment the active blocks are backed up at one time for example as one backup operation instead of backing up individual active blocks.

To illustrate the potential benefits of the backup process an example virtual machine image might include 70 GB of zero blocks 20 GB of active blocks and 10 GB of deleted blocks. A traditional backup process without zero or deleted block handling would create a backup file of 70 20 10 100 GB or somewhat smaller with file compression . With zero handling the backup file would be 20 10 30 GB or smaller with compression . However applying the backup process the backup file size would be 20 GB because both zeros and deleted blocks are skipped by the backup process . This file can also be compressed to further reduce storage consumption.

In addition the backup process can still provide benefits even if the example above were changed to include 70 GB of zero blocks 20 GB of active blocks and 0 GB of deleted blocks. While the size of the backup file would be the same or approximately the same whether using zero handling or the process the speed of the backup process can be greater than a zero handling process. The speed increase can be due to the process determining which blocks are zeros more quickly than a traditional zero handling process which scans all the blocks to determine where the zero blocks are. Techniques for rapidly detecting zeros deleted blocks and active blocks are described below more fully with respect to .

At state a virtual disk file is accessed and file system data is accessed from the virtual disk file at state . In one embodiment the mapping module directly accesses the metadata in the virtual disk file. For example the mapping module can access a Master Boot Record MBR in the virtual disk file which is typically in the same location for most virtual disk files such as within the first several bytes of the file . The mapping module can determine the location of the file system data from the MBR. For NTFS file systems for example the MFT metadata file is at a certain offset in the MBR. Thus once the mapping module has located the file system the mapping module can access the MFT at the expected location.

In another embodiment the mapping module indirectly obtains access to the virtual disk file by calling an application programming interface API provided for example by a virtual machine vendor. For example in VMWARE virtual machine environments such an API exists for accessing virtual disk file data. The API can further include functionality for accessing the contents of the virtual disk file including the file system metadata. This indirect approach to accessing metadata can be useful when the mapping module is implemented in a different file system than the virtual disk file. For instance if the mapping module is implemented in a WINDOWS file system but the virtual disk file is formatted for the LINUX file system an API can allow the mapping module to read the LINUX formatted virtual disk file.

At state for a storage block in the metadata it is determined what type of data is represented by the block. As described above the mapping module can determine whether a block contains active deleted or zero data. At decision state it is determined whether the block is active. In one embodiment an active block is any block that contains a portion of active data however small. Many file systems use a standard block size for partitioning data storage such as 4 kB. A file system might mark a 4 kB or other size block as active even if that active data in the block includes a tiny fraction of the full block size. Thus even though the backup processes described herein can avoid backing up a substantial amount of deleted data some deleted data may still be saved in a backup process.

In some embodiments the mapping module maps a plurality of file system blocks to a single status bit byte or the like. For instance instead of mapping each 4 kB block in a file system to a single status bit e.g. representing active or deleted the mapping module can map 256 file system blocks to a single status bit if any of the 256 blocks have active data. If each of the file system blocks is 4 kB large the mapping module can therefore equivalently map 1 MB of file system data 256 4 kB to a single status bit. In another embodiment the mapping module can map 64 file system blocks to a single status bit if any of the 64 blocks have active data. If each of the file system blocks is 4 kB large the mapping module can then equivalently map 256 kB of file system data 64 4 kB to a single status bit. Other mapping sizes can be chosen.

In one embodiment the mapping size is chosen to optimize or otherwise improve the performance of compression algorithms employed by the backup module when compressing the backup virtual disk file . Some compression algorithms when used as an in line process e.g. in line with a backup process take less processing time when using smaller mapping sizes whereas others take less time when using larger mapping sizes. Using a larger mapping size can result in storing more deleted data at the possible beneficial tradeoff of reducing compression processing time. The mapping module can automatically adjust the mapping size used based at least partly on the compression algorithm selected.

If the block is not active an entry is created in a map to indicate that the block is not active at state . Otherwise it is further determined at decision state whether the block is part of an active temporary file. If the block is part of an active temporary file the block is active because it does not contain deleted data. However to save backup storage space in certain embodiments an entry is created in a map to indicate that the temporary file block is not active at state . Examples of temporary files include virtual memory files e.g. pagefile.sys in WINDOWS system sleep or hibernate state files such as hiberfile.sys in WINDOWS temporary Internet files and the like. An option to skip e.g. mark as inactive or to not skip temporary files can be provided by the user interface module described above.

If the block is not part of a temporary file an entry is created in the map indicating that the block is active at state . It is then determined whether additional blocks are left in the metadata to analyze at decision state . If so the block mapping process loops back to state . Otherwise the block mapping process ends.

The mapping process can be used in conjunction with other systems that provide zero handling. For instance the mapping process can be applied as a filter to the output of a zero handling system. An example zero handling system provided by VMWARE is the Change Block Tracking CBT system. In one embodiment the backup module can use the CBT system to obtain information about zero blocks. The CBT can perform a full file system scan to identify and map the zero blocks. Thereafter the mapping module can apply the process to identify deleted blocks in the machine image. The mapping module can modify the map provided by the CBT system to indicate the locations of deleted blocks.

It should be noted that in certain embodiments the mapping module stores the map in memory instead of persisting the map to disk storage. In another embodiment the mapping module does not create a map data structure. Instead the mapping module can determine whether a block is active deleted and or zero and provide an indication of this determination to the backup module e.g. through memory . The backup module can then back up the referenced block. The mapping module can then examine the next block followed by the backup module backing up the next block and so on. Thus the determination of active deleted and or zero blocks can be performed in line with backup operations.

Moreover in certain embodiments the mapping module can map the virtual disk file from outside of the virtual machine for example outside of a guest operating system of the virtual machine . The mapping module can therefore reduce the impact of mapping operations on the virtual machine . The mapping module and or the backup module can also facilitate obtaining a more complete picture of the virtual disk file because the mapping module and or the backup module can execute outside of the virtual machine. In addition in some embodiments the backup module performs backup operations from outside of the virtual machine . In other embodiments the mapping module is a process running in the virtual machine and therefore maps the file system from within the virtual machine . In one such embodiment the mapping module can access an operating system API to determine the location of the metadata and access the metadata. The backup module can also be a process running in the virtual machine e.g. as a volume shadow copy service . In another embodiment the mapping module can run inside of the virtual machine while the backup module runs outside or vice versa.

Some or all of the blocks can be mapped by the block mapping process to a corresponding unit of a map . In the depicted embodiment the map is a bitmap and each unit of the map represents one bit of storage. Thus the block mapping process can map the file system blocks to bit units bits in the map . As each unit is one bit large in some embodiments the map can consume far less memory than the file system and therefore can be an efficient way to store block status information. In certain embodiments the map can also be compressed to further reduce its storage impact.

In the depicted embodiment the bits in the map include a 1 to represent active blocks and a 0 to represent inactive blocks including both deleted and zero blocks . Of course the roles of the 1 and 0 characters can be reversed or other symbols can be used to represent active and inactive blocks. In another embodiment a third symbol can be used to distinguish deleted and zero blocks . The bits can be packed into bytes or octets so as to be addressable in most storage systems. In other embodiments a single byte or other unit of storage can be used to represent each block .

Data structures other than maps can be used to store block status information. For example database tables lists arrays or other structures can be used to store status information. Many other storage options will be apparent from this disclosure.

At state zeros are written to blocks in a restore file to provide a clean file when restoring a virtual machine image. Advantageously in certain embodiments these zeros can be written at disk subsystem speeds and can be faster than restoring zero blocks over a network.

A map of active and inactive blocks is accessed at state for example from the backup server . Active blocks are identified in the map at state . The active blocks are then restored by overwriting the zero blocks in the proper locations at state . In certain embodiments state can be omitted from the restore process .

Depending on the embodiment certain acts events or functions of any of the algorithms described herein can be performed in a different sequence can be added merged or left out all together e.g. not all described acts or events are necessary for the practice of the algorithm . Moreover in certain embodiments acts or events can be performed concurrently e.g. through multi threaded processing interrupt processing or multiple processors or processor cores or on other parallel architectures rather than sequentially.
