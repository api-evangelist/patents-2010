This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 239 316 filed Sep. 2 2009 under 35 U.S.C. 119 e and incorporates the same in its entirety herein.

The present disclosure provides novel antibody analog compositions that simultaneously co engage antigens where one of the antigens is bound bivalently and the other antigen is bound monovalently. The novel antibody analogs described preferably utilize heterodimeric Fc regions. Methods of using the novel antibody analog compositions particularly for therapeutic purposes are also described herein.

Antibody based therapeutics have been used successfully to treat a variety of diseases including cancer and autoimmune inflammatory disorders. Yet improvements to this class of drugs are still needed particularly with respect to enhancing their clinical efficacy. One avenue being explored is the engineering of additional and novel antigen binding sites into antibody based drugs such that a single immunoglobulin molecule co engages two different antigens. Such non native or alternate antibody formats that engage two different antigens are often referred to as bispecifics. Because the considerable diversity of the antibody variable region Fv makes it possible to produce an Fv that recognizes virtually any molecule the typical approach to bispecific generation is the introduction of new variable regions into the antibody.

A number of alternate antibody formats have been explored for bispecific targeting Chames Baty 2009 mAbs 1 6 1 9 Holliger Hudson 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 expressly incorporated herein by reference . Initially bispecific antibodies were made by fusing two cell lines that each produced a single monoclonal antibody Milstein et al. 1983 Nature 305 537 540 . Although the resulting hybrid hybridoma or quadroma did produce bispecific antibodies they were only a minor population and extensive purification was required to isolate the desired antibody. An engineering solution to this was the use of antibody fragments to make bispecifics. Because such fragments lack the complex quaternary structure of a full length antibody variable light and heavy chains can be linked in single genetic constructs. Antibody fragments of many different forms have been generated including diabodies single chain diabodies tandem scFv s and Fabbispecifics Chames Baty 2009 mAbs 1 6 1 9 Holliger Hudson 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 expressly incorporated herein by reference . While these formats can be expressed at high levels in bacteria and may have favorable penetration benefits due to their small size they clear rapidly in vivo and can present manufacturing obstacles related to their production and stability. A principal cause of these drawbacks is that antibody fragments typically lack the constant region of the antibody with its associated functional properties including larger size high stability and binding to various Fc receptors and ligands that maintain long half life in serum i.e. the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn or serve as binding sites for purification i.e. protein A and protein G .

More recent work has attempted to address the shortcomings of fragment based bispecifics by engineering dual binding into full length antibody like formats Wu et al. 2007 Nature Biotechnology 25 11 1290 1297 U.S. Ser. No. 12 477 711 Michaelson et al. 2009 mAbs 1 2 128 141 PCT US2008 074693 Zuo et al. 2000 Protein Engineering 13 5 361 367 U.S. Ser. No 09 865 198 Shen et al. 2006 J Biol Chem 281 16 10706 10714 Lu et al. 2005 J Biol Chem 280 20 19665 19672 PCT US2005 025472 expressly incorporated herein by reference . These formats overcome some of the obstacles of the antibody fragment bispecifics principally because they contain an Fc region. One significant drawback of these formats is that because they build new antigen binding sites on top of the homodimeric constant chains binding to the new antigen is always bivalent.

For many antigens that are attractive as co targets in a therapeutic bispecific format the desired binding is monovalent rather than bivalent. For many immune receptors cellular activation is accomplished by cross linking of a monovalent binding interaction. The mechanism of cross linking is typically mediated by antibody antigen immune complexes or via effector cell to target cell engagement. For example the low affinity Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs such as Fc RIIa Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa bind monovalently to the antibody Fc region. Monovalent binding does not activate cells expressing these Fc Rs however upon immune complexation or cell to cell contact receptors are cross linked and clustered on the cell surface leading to activation. For receptors responsible for mediating cellular killing for example Fc RIIIa on natural killer NK cells receptor cross linking and cellular activation occurs when the effector cell engages the target cell in a highly avid format Bowles Weiner 2005 J Immunol Methods 304 88 99 expressly incorporated by reference . Similarly on B cells the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb downregulates B cell activation only when it engages into an immune complex with the cell surface B cell receptor BCR a mechanism that is mediated by immune complexation of soluble IgG s with the same antigen that is recognized by the BCR Heyman 2003 Immunol Lett 88 2 157 161 Smith and Clatworthy 2010 Nature Reviews Immunology 10 328 343 expressly incorporated by reference . As another example CD3 activation of T cells occurs only when its associated T cell receptor TCR engages antigen loaded MHC on antigen presenting cells in a highly avid cell to cell synapse Kuhns et al. 2006 Immunity 24 133 139 . Indeed nonspecific bivalent cross linking of CD3 using an anti CD3 antibody elicits a cytokine storm and toxicity Perruche et al. 2009 J Immunol 183 2 953 61 Chatenoud Bluestone 2007 Nature Reviews Immunology 7 622 632 expressly incorporated by reference . Thus for practical clinical use the preferred mode of CD3 co engagement for redirected killing of targets cells is monovalent binding that results in activation only upon engagement with the co engaged target.

Thus while bispecifics generated from antibody fragments suffer biophysical and pharmacokinetic hurdles a drawback of those built with full length antibody like formats is that they engage co target antigens multivalently in the absence of the primary target antigen leading to nonspecific activation and potentially toxicity. The present invention solves this problem by introducing a novel set of bispecific formats that enable the simultaneous bivalent and monovalent co engagement of distinct target antigens.

The present disclosure provides novel antibody analog compositions that co engage a first and second antigen.

The present invention is directed to a variety of antibodies generally referred to herein as antibody analogs as further described below that co engage at least two different antigens in novel ways. The two antigens of the invention are generally referred to as antigen 1 and antigen 2 with some embodiments described below including antigen 3 as a third antigen . In general there are two different types of antibody analogs that allow for co engagement mechanisms one that utilizes three antigen binding domains e.g. one antigen is bound bivalently and the other is bound monovalently although as is further described below there can also be three different antigens that are bound or a single antigen and one that relies on two antigen binding domains e.g. each antigen is bound monovalently .

In one embodiment antibody analogs are made that have three antigen binding domains. This embodiment can be exemplified in a variety of ways. In an embodiment of particular use this is done by using a traditional antibody structure two heavy chains with associated light chains that form antigen binding domains that includes an additional antigen binding domain at the opposite end of the antibody. That is in some embodiments all three of the antigen binding domains of the antibody analog are antibody variable regions comprising a variable heavy and variable light chain.

Generally in this embodiment two of the antigen binding domains bind to antigen 1 e.g. bivalently and the third antigen binding domain binds monovalently to antigen 2. As discussed below there are particular therapeutic embodiments for which monovalent binding can be preferred to avoid cross linking and or activation of certain pathways.

As outlined in this trimeric binding domain embodiment can be accomplished using two different heavy chains that is the antibody analog is heterodimeric as defined below. These heterodimeric heavy chains differ from one another in one or more ways. In general one of the heavy chains has a C terminal fusion e.g. fused to the C terminus of the CH3 domain of the first heavy chain that comprises an extra sometimes referred to herein as exogenous variable heavy domain. The other heavy chain also has a C terminal fusion that comprises an exogenous variable light domain. Together the two extra variable domains form an antigen binding domain. Thus in addition to the two traditional binding domains these antibody analogs have a third binding domain.

Optionally but preferred in some embodiments the two heavy chains also differ from each other by the presence of amino acid substitutions in the Fc domain that favors heterodimeric formation over homodimers. That is by changing amino acids in each heavy chain different heavy chains are more likely to associate to form the antibody analog structure than to form homodimers with the same Fc amino acid sequences.

In another embodiment antibody analogs are made that have two different antigen binding domains although as described below the antigens could be identical . While these antibody analogs share some functional similarity to bispecific antibodies and some antibody fragment constructs the bispecific antibody analogs of the present invention are easier to make and use than traditional bispecific antibodies.

In this embodiment the dimeric binding domain antibody analog also has components of traditional antibodies. The first heavy chain is identical to a traditional antibody construct in that in contains the variable heavy and light regions with the exception that it contains a C terminal fusion at the CH3 domain of an exogenous variable domain either heavy or light . The second heavy chain comprises the Fc region of the heavy chain and an N terminal variable light chain instead of a N terminal variable heavy chain such that the N terminal portion of the analog forms a first antigen binding site e.g. binds to antigen 1 . The second heavy chain also contains a C terminal fusion to the CH3 domain of an exogeneous variable domain either heavy or light such that one chain contains the exogenous heavy chain and the other the exogenous light chain. This general scheme is shown in .

In some embodiments of the invention the antigen binding regions of the antibody analog are antibody variable regions. In these embodiments binding to antigens is mediated by variable regions also referred to as Fv regions each comprising a VH domain and a VL domain. The Fv region that binds antigen 1 is referred to as Fv 1 while the Fv region that binds antigen 2 is referred to as Fv 2.

In some preferred embodiments of the invention the antibody analog is a novel antibody format referred to as mAb Fv or mAb Fab. As described herein mAb Fv comprises an IgG antibody with a C terminal Fv fusion. mAb Fab comprises an IgG antibody with a C terminal Fab fusion. The N terminal Fab regions of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab contain Fv 1. Because there are two such Fv 1 regions the mAb Fv and mAb Fab bind bivalently to antigen 1. That is one immunoglublin binds two of antigen 1 at the same time. In contrast the C terminal Fv region of the mAb Fv or C terminal Fab region of the mAb Fab contain Fv 2 which is the binding site for antigen 2. Because there is only one such Fv 2 region the mAb Fv and mAb Fab bind monovalently to antigen 2. That is one immunoglobulin binds only one of antigen 2. The mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins thus contain three variable regions two of which are Fv 1 and one of which is Fv 2. The mAb Fab differs from the mAb Fv in that the former contains CH and CL constant domains C terminal to the Fv 2 VH and VL domains respectively.

As described herein the mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins comprise three distinct immunoglobulin chains. These chains include an antibody light chain and two antibody heavy chains. One of said heavy chains comprises a VH or VH CH1 at its C terminus whereas the other of said heavy chains comprises a VL or VL CL at its C terminus.

Also described herein are analogues of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab that bind both antigen 1 and antigen 2 monovalently. These immunoglobulins are referred to as Fab Fv and Fab Fab. The Fab Fv and Fab Fab immunoglobulins comprise an N terminal Fab region that contains a single binding site for antigen 1 and comprise a C terminal Fv or Fab region that contains a single binding site for antigen 2.

mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins of the invention may also comprise single domain VHH regions as Fv 1. That is the N terminal binding portion of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab may lack a light chain and a CH1 domain.

In some preferred embodiment of the invention the first and second antigens are distinct. That is Fv 1 and Fv 2 bind different antigens. However in some embodiments antigen 1 and antigen 2 may be the same i.e. Fv 1 and Fv 2 have specificity for the same antigen.

Also contemplated herein are an immunoadhesin Fv and immunoadhesin Fab. In this format Fv 1 is replaced with a fusion protein for example a receptor that binds antigen 1. Thus antigen 1 is bound by a fusion protein while antigen 2 is bound by Fv 2.

The novel antibody analogs described preferably comprise a heterodimeric Fc region. A heterodimer Fc region as described herein is a pair of variant Fc regions that comprise at least one amino acid modification in each Fc region. In a preferred embodiment said amino acid modifications stabilize a heterodimeric Fc region while destabilizing homodimeric Fc regions. In one embodiment of the invention said variant Fc regions comprise at least one substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 349 351 354 356 357 364 366 368 370 392 394 395 396 397 399 401 405 407 409 411 and 439 wherein numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In a preferred embodiment said variant Fc regions comprise at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 349A 349C 349E 349I 349K 349S 349T 349W 351 E 351 K 354C 356K 357K 364C 364D 364E 364F 364G 364H 364R 364T 364Y 366D 366K 366S 366W 366Y 368A 368E 368K 368S 370C 370D 370E 370G 370R 370S 370V 392D 392E 394F 394S 394W 394Y 395T 395V 396T 397E 397S 397T 399K 401 K 405A 405S 407T 407V 409D 409E 411D 411E 411K and 439D.

By amino acid and amino acid identity as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non natural analogues that may be present at a specific defined position. Thus amino acid as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example homophenylalanine citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. Amino acid also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the R or the S configuration. In the preferred embodiment the amino acids are in the S or L configuration. If non naturally occurring side chains are used non amino acid substituents may be used for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.

An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner which in general may be any protein polypeptide or small molecule. The role of the non Fc part of an Fc fusion i.e. the fusion partner is to mediate target binding and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody. Virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Protein fusion partners may include but are not limited to the target binding region of a receptor an adhesion molecule a ligand an enzyme a cytokine a chemokine or some other protein or protein domain. Small molecule fusion partners may include any therapeutic agent that directs the Fc fusion to a therapeutic target. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies the discussion on antibodies in the present disclosure extends also to Fc fusions.

Virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Protein fusion partners may include but are not limited to the variable region of any antibody the target binding region of a receptor an adhesion molecule a ligand an enzyme a cytokine a chemokine or some other protein or protein domain. Small molecule fusion partners may include any agent that directs the Fc fusion to a target antigen.

 Antibodies Abs and immunoglobulins Igs are glycoproteins although as described herein engineered glycoforms including aglycosylated and afucosylated forms can be made having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are for example produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. Thus an immunoglobulin is a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of at least one immunoglobulin gene. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms including but not limited to full length antibodies antibody fragments and analogs including Fc fusions and immunoadhesins as described below as well as individual immunoglobulin domains.

Antibodies are immunoglobulins that bind a specific antigen. In most mammals including humans and mice antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies and are responsible for binding the target antigen. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin Ig domains and thus the generic term immunoglobulin can be used for such proteins.

Traditional natural antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa and one heavy chain typically having a molecular weight of about 50 70 kDa . Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon and define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. IgG has several subclasses including but not limited to IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including but not limited to IgM1 and IgM2. IgA has several subclasses including but not limited to IgA1 and IgA2. Thus isotype as used herein is meant any of the classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. The known human immunoglobulin isotypes are IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 IgA2 IgM1 IgM2 IgD and IgE. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions although subtler differences may exist in the variable region.

Each of the light and heavy chains are made up of two distinct regions referred to as the variable and constant regions. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VH CH1 CH2 CH3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain heavy chain constant domain 1 heavy chain constant domain 2 and heavy chain constant domain 3 respectively also referred to as VH C 1 C 2 C 3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain constant gamma 1 domain constant gamma 2 domain and constant gamma 3 domain respectively . The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VL CL referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively. The constant regions show less sequence diversity and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. The structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody including the variable and constant regions is referred to herein as a full length antibody . In most mammals including humans and mice the full length antibody of the IgG isotype is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains each pair having one light and one heavy chain each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VL and CL and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VH C 1 C 2 and C 3. In some mammals for example in camels and llamas IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region.

The variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. In the variable region three loops are gathered for each of the V domains of the heavy chain and light chain to form an antigen binding site. Each of the loops is referred to as a complementarity determining region hereinafter referred to as a CDR in which the variation in the amino acid sequence is most significant. There are 6 CDRs total three each per heavy and light chain designated VH CDR1 VH CDR2 VH CDR3 VL CDR1 VL CDR2 and VL CDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework FR region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold the FR region upon which substantial antigen binding diversity the CDRs can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms some unbound and some in complex with antigen. Sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are disclosed for example in Morea et al. 1997 Biophys Chem 68 9 16 Morea et al. 2000 Methods 20 267 279 entirely incorporated by reference and the conserved features of antibodies are disclosed for example in Maynard et al. 2000 Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339 376 entirely incorporated by reference.

The carboxy terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function e.g. the Fc region. In the IgG subclass of immunoglobulins there are several immunoglobulin domains in the heavy chain referred to as heavy constant CH regions. In the context of IgG antibodies the IgG isotypes each have three CH regions. Accordingly CH domains in the context of IgG are as follows CH1 refers to positions 118 220 according to the EU index as in Kabat. CH2 refers to positions 237 340 according to the EU index as in Kabat and CH3 refers to positions 341 447 according to the EU index as in Kabat.

Another important region of the heavy chain is the hinge region. By hinge or hinge region or antibody hinge region or immunoglobulin hinge region herein is meant the flexible polypeptide comprising the amino acids between the first and second constant domains of an antibody. Structurally the IgG CH1 domain ends at EU position 220 and the IgG CH2 domain begins at residue EU position 237. Thus for IgG the antibody hinge is herein defined to include positions 221 D221 in IgG1 to 236 G236 in IgG1 wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments for example in the context of an Fc region the lower hinge is included with the lower hinge generally referring to positions 226 or 230 to 236.

For all constant region positions discussed in the present invention numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat Kabat et al. 19915th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda entirely incorporated by reference . For all variable region positions discussed in the present invention numbering is according to the Kabat numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 ibid . Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that these conventions consist of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index or by the Kabat numbering scheme will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence.

The present invention provides antibody analogs. By antibody herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes for example in humans include the kappa K lambda A and heavy chain genetic loci which together comprise the myriad variable region genes and the constant region genes mu delta gamma sigma and alpha which encode the IgM IgD IgG IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 IgE and IgA IgA1 and IgA2 isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism an engineered antibody or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental therapeutic or other purposes.

Of interest in embodiments described herein is the antibody Fc region. The Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region Fc comprises Ig domains C 2 and C 3 and the N terminal hinge leading into C 2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs . These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . In humans this protein family includes Fc RI CD64 including isoforms Fc RIa Fc RIb and Fc RIc Fc RII CD32 including isoforms Fc RIIa including allotypes H131 and R131 Fc RIIb including Fc RIIb 1 and Fc RIIb 2 and Fc RIIc and Fc RIII CD16 including isoforms Fc RIIIa including allotypes V158 and F158 and Fc RIIIb including allotypes Fc RIIIb NA1 and Fc RIIIb NA2 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc a membrane spanning region and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells eosinophils mast cells platelets B cells large granular lymphocytes Langerhans cells natural killer NK cells and T cells. Formation of the Fc Fc R complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators B cell activation endocytosis phagocytosis and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis ADCP .

The different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the Fc Rs with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The Fc Rs bind the IgG Fc region with different affinities. The extracellular domains of Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb are 96 identical however Fc RIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore whereas Fc RI Fc RIIa c and Fc RIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex triggered activation characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM Fc RIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors and Fc RIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. Despite these differences in affinities and activities all Fc Rs bind the same region on Fc at the N terminal end of the C 2 domain and the preceding hinge.

An overlapping but separate site on Fc serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc Fc R binding mediates ADCC Fc C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . A site on Fc between the C 2 and C 3 domains mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . This process coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule results in favorable antibody serum half lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. The fidelity of these regions the complement and FcRn protein A binding regions are important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their development.

A key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N linked glycosylation that occurs at N297. This carbohydrate or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. Efficient Fc binding to Fc R and C1q requires this modification and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins.

As is well known in the art immunoglobulin polymorphisms exist in the human population. Gm polymorphism is determined by the IGHG1 IGHG2 and IGHG3 genes which have alleles encoding allotypic antigenic determinants referred to as G1m G2m and G3m allotypes for markers of the human IgG1 IgG2 and IgG3 molecules no Gm allotypes have been found on the gamma 4 chain . Markers may be classified into allotypes and isoallotypes . These are distinguished on different serological bases dependent upon the strong sequence homologies between isotypes. Allotypes are antigenic determinants specified by allelic forms of the Ig genes. Allotypes represent slight differences in the amino acid sequences of heavy or light chains of different individuals. Even a single amino acid difference can give rise to an allotypic determinant although in many cases there are several amino acid substitutions that have occurred. Allotypes are sequence differences between alleles of a subclass whereby the antisera recognize only the allelic differences. An isoallotype is an allele in one isotype which produces an epitope which is shared with a non polymorphic homologous region of one or more other isotypes and because of this the antisera will react with both the relevant allotypes and the relevant homologous isotypes Clark 1997 IgG effector mechanisms Chem.

The variable region of an antibody as is well known in the art can compose sequences from a variety of species. In some embodiments the antibody variable region can be from a nonhuman source including but not limited to mice rats rabbits camels llamas and monkeys. In some embodiments the scaffold components can be a mixture from different species. As such an antibody disclosed herein may be a chimeric antibody and or a humanized antibody. In general both chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies refer to antibodies that combine regions from more than one species. For example chimeric antibodies traditionally comprise variable region s from a mouse or other nonhuman species and the constant region s from a human.

 Humanized antibodies generally refer to non human antibodies that have had the variable domain framework regions swapped for sequences found in human antibodies. Generally in a humanized antibody the entire antibody except the CDRs is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody except within its CDRs. The CDRs some or all of which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non human organism are grafted into the beta sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described in e.g. WO 92 11018 Jones 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 Science 239 1534 1536. Backmutation of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct U.S. Pat.

The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region typically that of a human immunoglobulin and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region.

In one embodiment the antibody is a fully human antibody with at least one modification as outlined herein.

The present invention provides antibody analogs. As used herein antibodies may comprise a variety of structures including but not limited to full length antibodies antibody fragments bispecific antibodies minibodies domain antibodies synthetic antibodies sometimes referred to herein as antibody mimetics antibody fusions antibody conjugates and fragments of each respectively.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulin comprises an antibody fragment. Specific antibody fragments include but are not limited to i the Fab fragment consisting of VL VH CL and CH1 domains ii the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains iii the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody iv the dAb fragment which consists of a single variable v isolated CDR regions vi F ab 2 fragments a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments vii single chain Fv molecules scFv wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site viii bispecific single chain Fv dimers and ix diabodies or triabodies multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion. The antibody fragments may be modified. For example the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains. Examples of antibody formats and architectures are described in Holliger Hudson 2006 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 and Carter 2006 Nature Reviews Immunology 6 343 357 and references cited therein all expressly incorporated by reference.

The present invention provides antibody analogs that are a novel set of formats that enable co engaged antigens to be bound with different valencies. Specifically as discussed herein there are two general formats an antibody analog that has three antigen binding domains and one that has two.

In one preferred embodiment a first antigen can be bound bivalently while a second antigen is simultaneously bound monovalently. The novel immunoglobulin compositions herein co engage a first and second antigen referred to herein as antigen 1 and antigen 2 respectively. Binding to the antigens is mediated by first and second antigen binding regions such that antigen 1 is bound bivalently by the immunoglobulin while antigen 2 is bound monovalently by the immunoglobulin. That is the immunoglobulin of the invention contains two binding sites for antigen 1 but only one binding site for antigen 2.

In preferred embodiments of the invention the antigen binding regions of the immunoglobulin are antibody variable regions also referred to as Fv regions each comprising a VH domain and a VL domain. The Fv region that binds antigen 1 is referred to as Fv 1 while the Fv region that binds antigen 2 is referred to as Fv 2.

Preferred immunoglobulin formats of the invention for co engaging antigens with different valencies comprise IgG antibodies with a C terminal Fv region. Such immunoglobulins typically comprise a full length antibody that is linked C terminally to a set of VH and VL domains that make up a novel Fv region Fv 2 and thus a novel antigen binding site for antigen 2 . The C terminal VH and VL domains may also be linked C terminally to CH1 and CL domains thereby resulting in a C terminal Fab that makes up the novel antigen binding site. These immunoglobulins are referred to as mAb Fv and mAb Fab. The VH and VL domains are typically linked C terminally to the Fc region via flexible linkers. A variety of linkers are described herein that may find use for linking the VH and VL domains C terminally to the constant chain in order to generate the novel binding site Fv 2.

The N terminal Fab regions of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab contain the binding site for the primary or first antigen antigen 1 . Accordingly this Fv region is referred to as Fv 1. Because there are two such Fv 1 regions the mAb Fv and mAb Fab bind bivalently to antigen 1. That is one immunoglublin binds two of antigen 1 at the same time. In contrast the C terminal Fv region of the mAb Fv or C terminal Fab region of the mAb Fab contain the binding site for the second antigen antigen 2 . Thus this Fv region is referred to as Fv 2. Because there is only one such Fv 2 region the mAb Fv and mAb Fab bind monovalently to antigen 2. That is one immunoglublin binds only one of antigen 2. The mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins thus contain three variable regions two of which are Fv 1 and one of which is Fv 2.

The mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins comprise three distinct immunoglobulin chains. These chains include an antibody light chain and two antibody heavy chains. One of said heavy chains comprises a VH or VH CH1 at its C terminus whereas the other of said heavy chains comprises a VL or VL CL at its C terminus. Thus the heavy chain dimer that is competent to bind the second antigen is a heterodimer rather than a homodimer as is the case naturally for IgG s. The use of two distinct heavy chains is an important component of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab that enables the engineering of a second antigen binding site using a VH VL pair.

Because of the presence of this heterodimeric constant chain the mAb Fv and mAb Fab formats are particularly suited for the use of variants that favor Fc heterodimerization and disfavor Fc homodimerization. Different variant heavy chains for example containing CH3 substitutions can be linked to the different heavy chains of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab. One variant heavy chain can be linked C terminally to the VH of the mAb Fv or VH CH1 of the mAb Fab while the other variant chain can be linked C terminally to the VL of the mAb Fv or VL CL of the mAb Fab thereby generating the new monovalent Fv 2. Moreover the additional Fv 2 VH VL and VH CH1 VL CL pairings may add further specificity to the heterodimer relative to the homodimer.

Heterodimerc Fc variants are not a necessity however for generation and use of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab. Protein purification methods may be employed to purify the desired heterodimeric heavy chains. In the absence of Fc variants that favor heterodimerization and disfavor homodimerization transfection of the three different DNAs one light chain and two heavy chains would result in three separate species 25 homodimer 50 heterodimer and 25 homodimer. The 50 heterodimer is the species that comprises both the C terminal VH and C terminal VL domains and thus the species that is comprises an Fv 2 that is competent to bind antigen 2. The two 25 homodimer species would comprise homdimeric heavy chains that contain two C terminal VL s or two C terminal VH s and thus would typically not be able to bind antigen 2. Using protein purification methods described herein and generally known in the art the desired 50 heterodimeric mAb Fv or mAb Fab species can be purified yielding a composition that is competent of engaging antigen 2.

The antibody analogs of the trimeric antigen binding domain constructs generally comprise two modified antibody heavy chains with associated light chains where each heavy chain possesses two variable regions and a constant region. The first modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Domain COOH and the second modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Domain COOH. Thus the N terminal variable heavy domains interact with the associated light chains to form an antigen binding site on each chain as in a traditional antibody providing two antigen binding domains . On the opposite end of the molecule one of the variable domains at the C terminus of one chain is a variable heavy domain and the other C terminal variable domain on the other chain is a variable light domain such that a third antigen binding domain is formed. In most instances the two antigen binding domains at the N terminal ends of the chains are to the same antigen to bind the antigen bivalently. The third binding domain at the C terminus is monovalent and generally directed to a second antigen as described herein.

In some embodiments as is depicted in the C terminus of each chain may further comprise a CH1 domain as well. In this instance the first modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Domain Constant Domain CH1 and or CL COOH and the second modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Domain Constant Domain CH1 and or CL COOH.

Also described herein are analogues of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab that bind both antigen 1 and antigen 2 monovalently. These immunoglobulins are referred to as Fab Fv and Fab Fab. Rather than comprising three separate chains these formats contain two different heavy chains i.e. they lack a native light chain. For one of the heavy chains the N terminal Fv 1 VH CH1 half of the Fab region are replaced with the Fv 1 VL CL region. Thus the heterodimer species of the Fab Fv and Fab Fab comprise an N terminal Fab region that contains a single binding site for antigen 1 and comprise a C terminal Fv or Fab region that contains a single binding site for antigen 2. For the Fab Fv the first modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Heavy Domain COOH and the second modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Light Domain Constant Domain Variable Light Domain. For the Fab Fab the first modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain Variable Heavy Domain Constant Domain e.g. CH1 COOH and the second modified antibody heavy chain has the structure NH2 Variable Light Domain Constant Domain Variable Light Domain Constant Domain e.g. CL COOH.

The use of VH and VL domains to generate the novel binding site Fv 2 is a preferred embodiment. However other antigen 1 binding modalities may also be useful when linked with a C terminal monovalent Fv 2. For example rather than using both VH and VL domains as Fv 1 mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins may also comprise single domain VHH regions as Fv 1. Such VHH regions are described for example in Wesolowski et al. 2009 Med Microbiol Immunol 198 3 157 174 and references therein herein expressly incorporated by reference.

In these constructs the N terminal binding portion of the mAb Fv and mAb Fab may lack a light chain and a CH1 domain. It is also possible to utilize the C terminal monovalent Fv 2 in the context of an Fc fusion also referred to as an immunoadhesin. In this format Fv 1 is replaced with a fusion protein for example a receptor that binds antigen 1. Thus antigen 1 is bound by a fusion protein while antigen 2 is bound by Fv 2.

Antibody analogs disclosed herein may comprise an Fc variant. An Fc variant comprises one or more amino acid modifications relative to a parent Fc polypeptide wherein the amino acid modification s provide one or more optimized properties. By modification herein is meant an alteration in the physical chemical or sequence properties of a protein polypeptide antibody or immunoglobulin. An amino acid modification can be an amino acid substitution insertion and or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. By amino acid substitution or substitution herein is meant the replacement of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence with another amino acid. For example the substitution Y349T refers to a variant polypeptide in this case a constant heavy chain variant in which the tyrosine at position 349 is replaced with threonine. By amino acid insertion or insertion as used herein is meant the addition of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence. By amino acid deletion or deletion as used herein is meant the removal of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence.

An Fc variant disclosed herein differs in amino acid sequence from its parent by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may have more than one amino acid modification as compared to the parent for example from about one to fifty amino acid modifications e.g. from about one to ten amino acid modifications from about one to about five amino acid modifications etc. compared to the parent. Thus the sequences of the Fc variants and those of the parent Fc polypeptide are substantially homologous. For example the variant Fc variant sequences herein will possess about 80 homology with the parent Fc variant sequence e.g. at least about 90 homology at least about 95 homology at least about 98 homology at least about 99 homology etc. Modifications disclosed herein also include glycoform modifications. Modifications may be made genetically using molecular biology or may be made enzymatically or chemically.

Fc variants disclosed herein are defined according to the amino acid modifications that compose them. Thus for example the substitution Y349T refers to a variant polypeptide in this case a constant heavy chain variant in which the tyrosine at position 349 is replaced with threonine. Likewise Y349T T394F defines an Fc variant with the substitutions Y349T and T394F relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. The identity of the WT amino acid may be unspecified in which case the aforementioned variant is referred to as 349T 394F. It is noted that the order in which substitutions are provided is arbitrary that is to say that for example 349T 394F is the same Fc variant as 394F 349T. Unless otherwise noted constant region and Fc positions discussed herein are numbered according to the EU index or EU numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The EU index or EU index as in Kabat or EU numbering scheme refers to the numbering of the EU antibody Edelman et al. 1969 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63 78 85 hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

In certain embodiments the Fc variants disclosed herein are based on human IgG sequences and thus human IgG sequences are used as the base sequences against which other sequences are compared including but not limited to sequences from other organisms for example rodent and primate sequences. Immunoglobulins may also comprise sequences from other immunoglobulin classes such as IgA IgE IgGD IgGM and the like. It is contemplated that although the Fc variants disclosed herein are engineered in the context of one parent IgG the variants may be engineered in or transferred to the context of another second parent IgG. This is done by determining the equivalent or corresponding residues and substitutions between the first and second IgG typically based on sequence or structural homology between the sequences of the first and second IgGs. In order to establish homology the amino acid sequence of a first IgG outlined herein is directly compared to the sequence of a second IgG. After aligning the sequences using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art for example using conserved residues as between species allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment i.e. avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of the first immunoglobulin are defined. Alignment of conserved residues may conserve 100 of such residues. However alignment of greater than 75 or as little as 50 of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining structural homology between a first and second IgG that is at the level of tertiary structure for IgGs whose structures have been determined. In this case equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor N on N CA on CA C on C and O on O are within about 0.13 nm after alignment. In another embodiment equivalent residues are within about 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non hydrogen protein atoms of the proteins. Regardless of how equivalent or corresponding residues are determined and regardless of the identity of the parent IgG in which the IgGs are made what is meant to be conveyed is that the Fc variants discovered as disclosed herein may be engineered into any second parent IgG that has significant sequence or structural homology with the Fc variant. Thus for example if a variant antibody is generated wherein the parent antibody is human IgG1 by using the methods described above or other methods for determining equivalent residues the variant antibody may be engineered in another IgG1 parent antibody that binds a different antigen a human IgG2 parent antibody a human IgA parent antibody a mouse IgG2a or IgG2b parent antibody and the like. Again as described above the context of the parent Fc variant does not affect the ability to transfer the Fc variants disclosed herein to other parent IgGs.

Of particular benefit to the immunoglobulins of the invention are Fc variants that favor heterodimerization of the Fc region relative to homodimerization. That is by modifying one or more amino acids within each heavy chain that forms the Fc region such that each heavy chain comprises at least one amino acid variant as compared to the other chain binding of the different heavy chains to form heterodimeric Fc regions is favored over the individual heavy chains forming homodimers.

Such variants referred to herein as hetero Fc variants comprise a pair of different variants such that one pair referred to as variant modifies one CH3 domain referred to as CH3 while the other pair variant modifies another CH3 domain CH3 . The variants are designed such that their interaction in a heterodimeric CH3 interface variant variant is favorable thus resulting in a stable heterodimeric Fc species comprising CH3 CH3 . In contrast the pairing of each variant with itself across a homodimeric CH3 interface variant variant and variant variant is unfavorable resulting in unstable homodimeric Fc species comprising CH3 CH3 and CH3 CH3 .

For two different protein chains with identical i.e. native CH3 domains in the absence of hetero Fc variants transfection of two different DNAs encoding two different heavy chains would result in three separate species 25 homodimer 50 heterodimer and 25 homodimer . The hetero Fc variants of the invention increase the percentage population of the heterodimer while reducing the population of the homodimers. For example Fc variants that favor heterodimerization and disfavor homodimerization may alter the populations such that the heterodimer population increases to 70 preferably 80 more preferably 90 and most preferably greater than 95 . For example hetero Fc variants may reduce the homodimer populations to 2.5 and 2.5 while increasing the heterodimer population to 95 . Populations of the different species may be measured using a variety of methods well known in the art including methods described herein including for example gel electropheresis and biochemical assays. Heterodimeric immunoglobulin species may optionally be isolated further from homodimeric species using any number of various protein purification methods well known in the art.

Hetero Fc variants herein preferably comprise at least one substitution at a position in a CH3 domain selected from the group consisting of 349 351 354 356 357 364 366 368 370 392 394 395 396 397 399 401 405 407 409 411 and 439 wherein numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In a preferred embodiment hetero Fc variants comprise at least one CH3 domain substitution per heavy chain selected from the group consisting of 349A 349C 349E 349I 349K 349S 349T 349W 351 E 351K 354C 356K 357K 364C 364D 364E 364F 364G 364H 364R 364T 364Y 366D 366K 366S 366W 366Y 368A 368E 368K 368S 370C 370D 370E 370G 370R 370S 370V 392D 392E 394F 394S 394W 394Y 395T 395V 396T 397E 397S 397T 399K 401 K 405A 405S 407T 407V 409D 409E 411 D 411 E 411K and 439D. Each of these variants can be used individually or in any combination for each heavy chain Fc region. As will be appreciated by those in the art each heavy chain can comprise different numbers of substitutions. As shown in Tables 2 and 3 below both heavy chains that make up the Fc region may comprise a single substitution one chain may comprise a single substitution and the other two substitutions both can contain two substitutions although each chain will contain different substitutions etc.

In some embodiments the hetero Fc variants are made in combinations that is two or more variants per heavy chain Fc domain selected from the group outlined above. Of use in particular embodiments are combination variants including but not limited to those shown in Tables 2 and 3 and in the Figures.

Other Fc variants that favor heterodimerization that may find use in the creation of the antibody analogs of the invention have been described Ridgeway et al. 1996 Protein Engineering 9 7 617 621 U.S. Pat.

The Fc variants disclosed herein may be optimized for improved or reduced binding to Fc receptors or Fc ligands. By Fc receptor or Fc ligand as used herein is meant a molecule preferably a polypeptide from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc Rs as described above including but not limited to Fc RIIIa Fc RIIa Fc RIIb Fc RI and FcRn C1q C3 mannan binding lectin mannose receptor staphylococcal protein A streptococcal protein G and viral Fc R. Fc ligands also include Fc receptor homologs FcRH which are a family of Fc receptors that are homologous to the Fc Rs. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc.

Immunoglobulins herein may be engineered to for optimized properties including but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc receptor. By greater affinity or improved affinity or enhanced affinity or better affinity than a parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant that an Fc variant binds to an Fc receptor with a significantly higher equilibrium constant of association KA or K or lower equilibrium constant of dissociation KD or K than the parent Fc polypeptide when the amounts of variant and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same. For example the Fc variant with improved Fc receptor binding affinity may display from about 5 fold to about 1000 fold e.g. from about 10 fold to about 500 fold improvement in Fc receptor binding affinity compared to the parent Fc polypeptide where Fc receptor binding affinity is determined for example by the binding methods disclosed herein including but not limited to Biacore by one skilled in the art. Accordingly by reduced affinity as compared to a parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant that an Fc variant binds an Fc receptor with significantly lower KA or higher KD than the parent Fc polypeptide. Greater or reduced affinity can also be defined relative to an absolute level of affinity.

In one embodiment particularly useful Fc modifications for the present invention are variants that reduce or ablate binding to one or more Fc Rs and or complement proteins thereby reducing or ablating Fc mediated effector functions such as ADCC ADCP and CDC. Such variants are also referred to herein as knockout variants or KO variants .

Immunoglobulins described herein can incorporate Fc modifications in the context of any IgG isotype or IgG isotype Fc region including but not limited to human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and or IgG4. The IgG isotype may be selected such as to alter Fc R and or complement mediated effector function s . Hybrid IgG isotypes may also be useful. For example U.S. Ser. No. 11 256 060 describes a number of hybrid IgG1 IgG2 constant regions that may find use in the particular invention. In some embodiments of the invention immunoglobulins may comprise means for isotypic modifications that is modifications in a parent IgG to the amino acid type in an alternate IgG. For example an IgG1 IgG3 hybrid variant may be constructed by a substitutional means for substituting IgG1 positions in the CH2 and or CH3 region with the amino acids from IgG3 at positions where the two isotypes differ. Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. 274Q 276K 300F 339T 356E 358M 384S 392N 397M 4221 435R and 436F. In other embodiments of the invention an IgG1 IgG2 hybrid variant may be constructed by a substitutional means for substituting IgG2 positions in the CH2 and or CH3 region with amino acids from IgG1 at positions where the two isotypes differ. Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. one or more of the following amino acid substations 233E 234L 235L 236G referring to an insertion of a glycine at position 236 and 327A.

The immunoglobulins of the invention may target virtually any antigen or pair of antigens. The mAb Fv and mAb Fab are particularly beneficial for targeting distinct antigens that is where antigen 1 and antigen 2 are different. Thus the immunoglobulins herein preferably co engage two target antigens.

Particular suitable applications of the immunoglobulins herein are co target pairs for which it is beneficial or critical to engage a target antigen monovalently. Such antigens may be for example immune receptors that are activated upon immune complexation. Cellular activation of many immune receptors occurs only by cross linking achieved typically by antibody antigen immune complexes or via effector cell to target cell engagement. For some immune receptors for example the CD3 signaling receptor on T cells activation only upon engagement with co engaged target is critical as nonspecific cross linking in a clinical setting can elicit a cytokine storm and toxicity. Therapeutically by engaging such antigens monovalently rather than multivalently using the immunoglobulins herein such activation occurs only in response to cross linking only in the microenvironment of the primary target antigen. The ability to target two different antigens with different valencies is a novel and useful aspect of the present invention. Examples of target antigens for which it may be therapeutically beneficial or necessary to co engage monovalently include but are not limited to immune activating receptors such as CD3 Fc Rs toll like receptors TLRs such as TLR4 and TLR9 cytokine chemokine cytokine receptors and chemokine receptors.

While the mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins described herein are particularly beneficial for targeting distinct antigens in some cases it may be beneficial to target only one antigen. That is Fv 1 and Fv 2 may have specificity for the same antigen thus binding the target antigen trivalently.

Virtually any antigen may be targeted by the immunoglobulins herein including but not limited to proteins subunits domains motifs and or epitopes belonging to the following list of target antigens which includes both soluble factors such as cytokines and membrane bound factors including transmembrane receptors 17 IA 4 1BB 4Dc 6 keto PGF1a 8 iso PGF2a 8 oxo dG A1 Adenosine Receptor A33 ACE ACE 2

Exemplary antigens that may be targeted specifically by the immunoglobulins of the invention include but are not limited to CD20 CD19 Her2 EGFR EpCAM CD3 Fc RIIIa CD16 Fc RIIa CD32a Fc RIIb CD32b Fc RI CD64 Toll like receptors TLRs such as TLR4 and TLR9 cytokines such as IL 2 IL 5 IL 13 IL 12 IL 23 and TNF cytokine receptors such as IL 2R chemokines chemokine receptors growth factors such as VEGF and HGF and the like.

The choice of suitable target antigens and co targets depends on the desired therapeutic application. Some targets that have proven especially amenable to antibody therapy are those with signaling functions. Other therapeutic antibodies exert their effects by blocking signaling of the receptor by inhibiting the binding between a receptor and its cognate ligand. Another mechanism of action of therapeutic antibodies is to cause receptor down regulation. Other antibodies do not work by signaling through their target antigen. The choice of co targets will depend on the detailed biology underlying the pathology of the indication that is being treated.

Monoclonal antibody therapy has emerged as an important therapeutic modality for cancer Weiner et al. 2010 Nature Reviews Immunology 10 317 327 Reichert et al. 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1073 1078 herein expressly incorporated by reference . For anti cancer treatment it may be desirable to target one antigen antigen 1 whose expression is restricted to the cancerous cells while co targeting a second antigen antigen 2 that mediates some immunological killing activity. For other treatments it may be beneficial to co target two antigens for example two angiogenic factors or two growth factors that are each known to play some role in proliferation of the tumor. Exemplary co targets for oncology include but are not limited to HGF and VEGF IGF 1R and VEGF Her2 and VEGF CD19 and CD3 CD20 and CD3 Her2 and CD3 CD19 and Fc RIIIa CD20 and Fc RIIIa Her2 and Fc RIIIa.

In some cases immunoglobulins herein may be directed against antigens for the treatment of infectious diseases.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens the ligands or receptors that bind them or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway may be operably linked to the immunoglobulins of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example an Fc fusion that targets TNF could be constructed by operably linking an Fc region to TNFR1 or TNFR2. Thus virtually any polypeptide whether a ligand receptor or some other protein or protein domain including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways may be operably linked to the immunoglobulins of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.

The term linker is used to denote polypeptides comprising two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art see e.g. Holliger P. et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 Poljak R. J. et al. 1994 Structure 2 1121 1123 . A variety of linkers may find use in some embodiments described herein to covalently link Fc regions to a fusion partner. Linker herein is also referred to as linker sequence spacer tethering sequence or grammatical equivalents thereof. Homo or hetero bifunctional linkers as are well known see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog technical section on cross linkers pages 155 200 incorporated entirely by reference . A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N and C termini of proteins or protein domains linkage via disulfide bonds and linkage via chemical cross linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment the linker is a peptide bond generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues Gly Ser Ala or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. In one embodiment the linker is from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length preferably about 1 to 30 amino acids in length. In one embodiment linkers of 1 to 20 amino acids in length may be used. Useful linkers include glycine serine polymers including for example GS n GSGGS n GGGGS n and GGGS n where n is an integer of at least one glycine alanine polymers alanine serine polymers and other flexible linkers. Alternatively a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers including but not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol may find use as linkers that is may find use as linkers.

Other linker sequences may include any sequence of any length of CL CH1 domain but not all residues of CL CH1 domain for example the first 5 12 amino acid residues of the CL CH1 domains. Linkers can be derived from immunoglobulin light chain for example C or C . Linkers can be derived from immunoglobulin heavy chains of any isotype including for example C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 1 C 2 C C and C . Linker sequences may also be derived from other proteins such as Ig like proteins e.g. TCR FcR KIR hinge region derived sequences and other natural sequences from other proteins.

All antibodies contain carbohydrate at conserved positions in the constant regions of the heavy chain. Each antibody isotype has a distinct variety of N linked carbohydrate structures. Aside from the carbohydrate attached to the heavy chain up to 30 of human IgGs have a glycosylated Fab region. IgG has a single N linked biantennary carbohydrate at Asn297 of the CH2 domain. For IgG from either serum or produced ex vivo in hybridomas or engineered cells the IgG are heterogeneous with respect to the Asn297 linked carbohydrate. For human IgG the core oligosaccharide normally consists of GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc with differing numbers of outer residues.

The carbohydrate moieties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein will be described with reference to commonly used nomenclature for the description of oligosaccharides. A review of carbohydrate chemistry which uses this nomenclature is found in Hubbard et al. 1981 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50 555 583. This nomenclature includes for instance Man which represents mannose GlcNAc which represents 2 N acetylglucosamine Gal which represents galactose Fuc for fucose and Glc which represents glucose. Sialic acids are described by the shorthand notation NeuNAc for 5 N acetylneuraminic acid and NeuNGc for 5 glycolylneuraminic.

The term glycosylation means the attachment of oligosaccharides carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together e.g. from two to about twelve simple sugars linked together to a glycoprotein. The oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of the glycoprotein through either N or O linkages. The oligosaccharides of immunoglobulins disclosed herein occur generally are attached to a CH2 domain of an Fc region as N linked oligosaccharides. N linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to an asparagine residue in a glycoprotein chain. The skilled artisan will recognize that for example each of murine IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b and IgG3 as well as human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgD CH2 domains have a single site for N linked glycosylation at residue 297.

For the purposes herein a mature core carbohydrate structure refers to a processed core carbohydrate structure attached to an Fc region which generally consists of the following carbohydrate structure GlcNAc Fucose GlcNAc Man Man GlcNAc typical of biantennary oligosaccharides. The mature core carbohydrate structure is attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein generally via N linkage to Asn297 of a CH2 domain of the Fc region. A bisecting GlcNAc is a GlcNAc residue attached to the 1 4 mannose of the mature core carbohydrate structure. The bisecting GlcNAc can be enzymatically attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure by a 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III enzyme GnTIII . CHO cells do not normally express GnTIII Stanley et al. 1984 J. Biol. Chem. 261 13370 13378 but may be engineered to do so Umana et al. 1999 Nature Biotech. 17 176 180 .

Described herein are immunoglobulins that comprise modified glycoforms or engineered glycoforms. By modified glycoform or engineered glycoform as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to a protein for example an antibody wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent protein. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing Fc R mediated effector function. In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are modified to control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region.

A variety of methods are well known in the art for generating modified glycoforms Uma a et al. 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 U.S. Ser. No. 12 434 533 all of which are expressly incorporated by reference . These techniques control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region for example by expressing an IgG in various organisms or cell lines engineered or otherwise for example Lec 13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2 0 cells by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway for example FUT8 1 6 fucosyltranserase and or 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII by modifying carbohydrate s after the IgG has been expressed or by expressing antibody in the presence of fucose analogs as enzymatic inhibitors. Other methods for modifying glycoforms of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include using glycoengineered strains of yeast Li et al. 2006 Nature Biotechnology 24 2 210 215 moss Nechansky et al. 2007 Mol Immunjol 44 7 1826 8 and plants Cox et al. 2006 Nat Biotechnol 24 12 1591 7 . The use of a particular method to generate a modified glycoform is not meant to constrain embodiments to that method. Rather embodiments disclosed herein encompass immunoglobulins with modified glycoforms irrespective of how they are produced.

In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are glycoengineered to alter the level of sialylation. Higher levels of sialylated Fc glycans in immunoglobulin G molecules can adversely impact functionality Scallon et al. 2007 Mol. Immunol. 44 7 1524 34 and differences in levels of Fc sialylation can result in modified anti inflammatory activity Kaneko et al. 2006 Science 313 670 673 . Because antibodies may acquire anti inflammatory properties upon sialylation of Fc core polysaccharide it may be advantageous to glycoengineer the immunoglobulins disclosed herein for greater or reduced Fc sialic acid content.

Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide thus for example an immuoglobulin may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively engineered glycoform may refer to the immunoglobulin that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. In one embodiment a composition disclosed herein comprises a glycosylated immunoglobulin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody e.g. 80 100 90 100 95 100 etc. of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks fucose. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In an alternative embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated immunoglobulin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In yet another embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated immunoglobulin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which contains sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that contains sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In another embodiment the combination of engineered glycoform and amino acid modification provides optimal Fc receptor binding properties to the antibody.

Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise one or more modifications that provide optimized properties. Said modifications may be amino acid modifications or may be modifications that are made enzymatically or chemically. Such modification s likely provide some improvement in the immunoglobulin for example an enhancement in its stability solubility function or clinical use. Disclosed herein are a variety of improvements that may be made by coupling the immunoglobulins disclosed herein with additional modifications.

In one embodiment the variable region of an immunoglobulin disclosed herein may be affinity matured that is to say that amino acid modifications have been made in the VH and or VL domains to enhance binding of the antibody to its target antigen. Such types of modifications may improve the association and or the dissociation kinetics for binding to the target antigen. Other modifications include those that improve selectivity for target antigen vs. alternative targets. These include modifications that improve selectivity for antigen expressed on target vs. non target cells. Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise one or more modifications that provide reduced or enhanced internalization of an immunoglobulin.

In one embodiment modifications are made to improve biophysical properties of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein including but not limited to stability solubility and oligomeric state. Modifications can include for example substitutions that provide more favorable intramolecular interactions in the immunoglobulin such as to provide greater stability or substitution of exposed nonpolar amino acids with polar amino acids for higher solubility. Other modifications to the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include those that enable the specific formation or homodimeric or homomultimeric molecules. Such modifications include but are not limited to engineered disulfides as well as chemical modifications or aggregation methods.

In further embodiments the immunoglobulins disclosed herein comprise modifications that remove proteolytic degradation sites. These may include for example protease sites that reduce production yields as well as protease sites that degrade the administered protein in vivo. In one embodiment additional modifications are made to remove covalent degradation sites such as deamidation i.e. deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues oxidation and proteolytic degradation sites. Deamidation sites that are particular useful to remove are those that have enhance propensity for deamidation including but not limited to asparaginyl and gltuamyl residues followed by glycines NG and QG motifs respectively . In such cases substitution of either residue can significantly reduce the tendency for deamidation. Common oxidation sites include methionine and cysteine residues. Other covalent modifications that can either be introduced or removed include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group. Additional modifications also may include but are not limited to posttranslational modifications such as N linked or O linked glycosylation and phosphorylation.

Modifications may include those that improve expression and or purification yields from hosts or host cells commonly used for production of biologics. These include but are not limited to various mammalian cell lines e.g. CHO yeast cell lines bacterial cell lines and plants. Additional modifications include modifications that remove or reduce the ability of heavy chains to form inter chain disulfide linkages. Additional modifications include modifications that remove or reduce the ability of heavy chains to form intra chain disulfide linkages.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise modifications that include the use of unnatural amino acids incorporated using including but not limited to methods described in Liu Schultz 2010 Annu Rev Biochem 79 413 444 herein expressly incorporated by reference. In some embodiments these modifications enable manipulation of various functional biophysical immunological or manufacturing properties discussed above. In additional embodiments these modifications enable additional chemical modification for other purposes.

Other modifications are contemplated herein. For example the immunoglobulin may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. Additional amino acid modifications may be made to enable specific or non specific chemical or posttranslational modification of the immunoglobulins. Such modifications include but are not limited to PEGylation and glycosylation. Specific substitutions that can be utilized to enable PEGylation include but are not limited to introduction of novel cysteine residues or unnatural amino acids such that efficient and specific coupling chemistries can be used to attach a PEG or otherwise polymeric moiety. Introduction of specific glycosylation sites can be achieved by introducing novel N X T S sequences into the immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

Modifications to reduce immunogenicity may include modifications that reduce binding of processed peptides derived from the parent sequence to MHC proteins. For example amino acid modifications would be engineered such that there are no or a minimal number of immune epitopes that are predicted to bind with high affinity to any prevalent MHC alleles. Several methods of identifying MHC binding epitopes in protein sequences are known in the art and may be used to score epitopes in an antibody disclosed herein.

Covalent modifications are included within the scope of immunoglobulins disclosed herein and are generally but not always done post translationally. For example several types of covalent modifications can be introduced into the molecule by reacting specific amino acid residues with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues. In some embodiments the covalent modification of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein comprises the addition of one or more labels. The term labeling group means any detectable label. In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the immunoglobulin via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are fusion proteins sometimes referred to herein as conjugates . The fusion partner or conjugate partner can be proteinaceous or non proteinaceous the latter generally being generated using functional groups on the immunoglobulin and on the conjugate partner. Conjugate and fusion partners may be any molecule including small molecule chemical compounds and polypeptides. For example a variety of conjugates and methods are described in Trail et al. 1999 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11 584 588 incorporated entirely by reference. Possible conjugate partners include but are not limited to cytokines cytotoxic agents toxins radioisotopes chemotherapeutic agent anti angiogenic agents a tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutically active agents. In some embodiments conjugate partners may be thought of more as payloads that is to say that the goal of a conjugate is targeted delivery of the conjugate partner to a targeted cell for example a cancer cell or immune cell by the immunoglobulin. Thus for example the conjugation of a toxin to an immunoglobulin targets the delivery of said toxin to cells expressing the target antigen. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art in reality the concepts and definitions of fusion and conjugate are overlapping. The designation of a fusion or conjugate is not meant to constrain it to any particular embodiment disclosed herein. Rather these terms are used loosely to convey the broad concept that any immunoglobulin disclosed herein may be linked genetically chemically or otherwise to one or more polypeptides or molecules to provide some desirable property.

Suitable conjugates include but are not limited to labels as described below drugs and cytotoxic agents including but not limited to cytotoxic drugs e.g. chemotherapeutic agents or toxins or active fragments of such toxins. Suitable toxins and their corresponding fragments include diphtheria A chain exotoxin A chain ricin A chain abrin A chain curcin crotin phenomycin enomycin and the like. Cytotoxic agents also include radiochemicals made by conjugating radioisotopes to immunoglobulin or binding of a radionuclide to a chelating agent that has been covalently attached to the immunoglobulin. Additional embodiments utilize calicheamicin auristatins geldanamycin maytansine and duocarmycins and analogs. Antibody drug conjugates are described in Alley et al. 2010 Curr Opin Chem Biol 14 4 529 37 herein expressly incorporated by reference.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are fused or conjugated to a cytokine. By cytokine as used herein is meant a generic term for proteins released by one cell population that act on another cell as intercellular mediators. For example as described in Penichet et al. 2001 J. Immunol. Methods 248 91 101 incorporated entirely by reference cytokines may be fused to an immunoglobulin to provide an array of desirable properties. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines monokines and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone N methionyl human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone parathyroid hormone thyroxine insulin proinsulin relaxin prorelaxin glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone FSH thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and luteinizing hormone LH hepatic growth factor fibroblast growth factor prolactin placental lactogen tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta mullerian inhibiting substance mouse gonadotropin associated peptide inhibin activin vascular endothelial growth factor integrin thrombopoietin TPO nerve growth factors such as NGF beta platelet growth factor transforming growth factors TGFs such as TGF alpha and TGF beta insulin like growth factor I and II erythropoietin EPO osteoinductive factors interferons such as interferon alpha beta and gamma colony stimulating factors CSFs such as macrophage CSF M CSF granulocyte macrophage CSF GM CSF and granulocyte CSF G CSF interleukins ILs such as IL 1 IL 1alpha IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 8 IL 9 IL 10 IL 11 IL 12 IL 15 a tumor necrosis factor such as TNF alpha or TNF beta C5a and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand KL . As used herein the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.

In yet another embodiment an immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the immunoglobulin receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide . In an alternate embodiment the immunoglobulin is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy ADEPT . ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the immunoglobulin to a prodrug activating enzyme that converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent.

Also disclosed herein are methods for producing and experimentally testing immunoglobulins. The disclosed methods are not meant to constrain embodiments to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more immunoglobulins may be produced and experimentally tested to obtain immunoglobulins. General methods for antibody molecular biology expression purification and screening are described in Antibody Engineering edited by Kontermann Dubel Springer Heidelberg 2001 and Hayhurst Georgiou 2001 Curr Opin Chem Biol 5 683 689 Maynard Georgiou 2000 Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339 76 

In one embodiment disclosed herein nucleic acids are created that encode the immunoglobulins and that may then be cloned into host cells expressed and assayed if desired. Thus nucleic acids and particularly DNA may be made that encode each protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well known procedures. For example a variety of methods that may find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein are described in Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 2001 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons both incorporated entirely by reference. There are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate DNA encoding immunoglobulins disclosed herein. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods PCR based method and methods which use variations of PCR ligase chain reaction based methods pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling error prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations classical site directed mutagenesis methods cassette mutagenesis and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly mutagenesis vector subcloning and the like and such commercial products find use in for generating nucleic acids that encode immunoglobulins.

The immunoglobulin proteins disclosed herein may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid e.g. an expression vector containing nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulins under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used including but not limited to mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and plant cells. For example a variety of cell lines that may find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein are described in the ATCC cell line catalog available from the American Type Culture Collection.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulins are expressed in mammalian expression systems including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used e.g. human mouse rat hamster and primate cells. Suitable cells also include known research cells including but not limited to Jurkat T cells NIH3T3 CHO BHK COS HEK293 PER C.6 HeLa Sp2 0 NS0 cells and variants thereof. In an alternateembodiment library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art and include and . In alternate embodiments immunoglobulins are produced in insect cells e.g. Sf21 Sf9 Bti Tn5b1 4 or yeast cells e.g. etc . In an alternate embodiment immunoglobulins are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic e.g. and eukaryotic e.g. wheat germ rabbit reticulocytes cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example as appreciated by those skilled in the art in vitro translation is required for some display technologies for example ribosome display. In addition the immunoglobulins may be produced by chemical synthesis methods. Also transgenic expression systems both animal e.g. cow sheep or goat milk embryonated hen s eggs whole insect larvae etc. and plant e.g. corn tobacco duckweed etc. 

The nucleic acids that encode the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self replicating extra chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art a variety of expression vectors are available commercially or otherwise that may find use for expressing immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

Expression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences selectable markers any fusion partners and or additional elements. By operably linked herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences ribosomal binding sites transcriptional start and stop sequences translational start and stop sequences and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.

Immunoglobulins may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein purification screening display and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the immunoglobulin sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids typically less than ten although longer linkers may also be used. Typically linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs immunoglobulin and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media or into the periplasmic space located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags His tags for example H6 and H10 or other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography IMAC systems e.g. Ni 2 affinity columns GST fusions MBP fusions Strep tag the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies for example c myc tags flag tags and the like . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art such tags may be useful for purification for screening or both. For example an immunoglobulin may be purified using a His tag by immobilizing it to a Ni 2 affinity column and then after purification the same His tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni 2 coated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay as described below . A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen immunoglobulins see below . Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well known in the art.

For example by fusing the members of an immunoglobulin library to the gene III protein phage display can be employed. Fusion partners may enable immunoglobulins to be labeled. Alternatively a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector enabling the fusion partner and associated immunoglobulin to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran mediated transfection calcium phosphate precipitation calcium chloride treatment polybrene mediated transfection protoplast fusion electroporation viral or phage infection encapsulation of the polynucleotide s in liposomes and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells transfection may be either transient or stable.

In one embodiment immunoglobulins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Purification may be particularly useful in the invention for separating heterodimeric heavy chain species from homodimeric heavy chain species as described herein. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques including ion exchange hydrophobic interaction affinity sizing or gel filtration and reversed phase carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic isoelectric focusing immunological precipitation dialysis and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques in conjunction with protein concentration are also useful. As is well known in the art a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies and these proteins can find use for purification of immunoglobulins disclosed herein. For example the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies as of course does the antibody s target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example immunoglobulins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed Ni 2 affinity chromatography if a His tag is employed or immobilized anti flag antibody if a flag tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques see e.g. incorporated entirely by reference Protein Purification Principles and Practice 3rd Ed. Scopes Springer Verlag NY 1994 incorporated entirely by reference. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the immunoglobulins. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment if the immunoglobulins are secreted screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins.

Immunoglobulins may be screened using a variety of in vitro methods including but not limited to those that use binding assays cell based assays and selection technologies. Automation and high throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By labeled herein is meant that the immunoglobulins disclosed herein have one or more elements isotopes or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general labels fall into three classes a immune labels which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody b isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes and c small molecule labels which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.

In one embodiment the functional and or biophysical properties of immunoglobulins are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Particularly relevant for the present invention the immunoglobulins may be tested for their affinity for one or more antigens. Properties that may be screened include but are not limited to stability solubility and affinity for Fc ligands for example Fc Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of immunoglobulins to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the immunoglobulin. In one embodiment the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the target antigen. In an alternate embodiment the screen is an assay for binding of immunoglobulins to an Fc ligand including but are not limited to the family of Fc Rs the neonatal receptor FcRn the complement protein C1q and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism. In one embodiment Fc ligands are from humans mice rats rabbits and or monkeys. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art including but not limited to FRET Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer and BRET Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer based assays AlphaScreen Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Scintillation Proximity Assay ELISA Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay SPR Surface Plasmon Resonance also known as BIACORE isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry gel electrophoresis and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the immunoglobulin. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels.

The biophysical properties of immunoglobulins for example stability and solubility may be tested using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be unfolded using chemical denaturant heat or pH and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy absorbance spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy calorimetry and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an immunoglobulin may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use for characterizing the biophysical properties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein include gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing capillary electrophoresis chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide mapping oligosaccharide mapping mass spectrometry ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry analytical ultra centrifugation dynamic light scattering proteolysis and cross linking turbidity measurement filter retardation assays immunological assays fluorescent dye binding assays protein staining assays microscopy and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment stability and or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition for example elevated temperature low pH or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable soluble and or well folded structured protein the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example a solution comprising an immunoglobulin could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the immunoglobulin s stability and solubility.

In one embodiment immunoglobulins may be tested using one or more cell based or in vitro assays. For such assays immunoglobulins purified or unpurified are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to immunoglobulins described herein. These assays are typically but not always based on the biology of the ability of the immunoglobulin to bind to the target antigen and mediate some biochemical event for example effector functions like cellular lysis phagocytosis ligand receptor binding inhibition inhibition of growth and or proliferation inhibition of calcium release and or signaling apoptosis and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to immunoglobulin for example cell survival cell death cellular phagocytosis cell lysis change in cellular morphology or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example such assays may measure the ability of immunoglobulins to elicit cell killing for example ADCC ADCP and CDC. Assays that measure cellular killing that is mediated by co engagement of antigens are particularly relevant for the invention. For some assays additional cells or components that is in addition to the target cells may need to be added for example serum complement or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes PBMCs NK cells macrophages T cells and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism e.g. humans mice rat rabbit and monkey. Crosslinked or monomeric antibodies may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody s target antigen or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art and include the use of dyes fluorophores immunochemical cytochemical and radioactive reagents. For example caspase assays or annexin flourconjugates may enable apoptosis to be measured and uptake or release of radioactive substrates e.g. Chromium 51 release assays or the metabolic reduction of fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth proliferation or activation to be monitored. In one embodiment the DELFIA EuTDA based cytotoxicity assay Perkin Elmer Mass. is used. Alternatively dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell based assays. In this case response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated or down regulated for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured or alternatively readout may be via a luciferase or GFP reporter construct. Cell based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an immunoglobulin. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed. Alternatively cell based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the immunoglobulins.

The biological properties of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be characterized in cell tissue and whole organism experiments. As is known in the art drugs are often tested in animals including but not limited to mice rats rabbits dogs cats pigs and monkeys in order to measure a drug s efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model or to measure a drug s pharmacokinetics toxicity and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. With respect to the immunoglobulins disclosed herein a particular challenge arises when using animal models to evaluate the potential for in human efficacy of candidate polypeptides this is due at least in part to the fact that immunoglobulins that have a specific effect on the affinity for a human Fc receptor may not have a similar affinity effect with the orthologous animal receptor. These problems can be further exacerbated by the inevitable ambiguities associated with correct assignment of true orthologues Mechetina et al. 2002 Immunogenetics 54 463 468 incorporated entirely by reference and the fact that some orthologues simply do not exist in the animal. Therapeutics are often tested in mice including but not limited to nude mice Rag deficient mice SCID mice xenograft mice and transgenic mice including knockins and knockouts . For example an immunoglobulin of the present invention that is intended as an anti cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model for example a xenograft mouse. In this method a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the drug to reduce or inhibit cancer growth and metastasis. Therapeutic immunoglobulins herein can be tested in mouse strains NZB NOD BXSB MRL Ipr K BxN and transgenics including knockins and knockouts . Such mice can develop various autoimmune conditions that resemble human organ specific systemic autoimmune or inflammatory disease pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and rheumatoid arthritis RA . For example an immunoglobulin disclosed herein intended for autoimmune diseases may be tested in such mouse models by treating the mice to determine the ability of the immunoglobulin to reduce or inhibit the development of the disease pathology. Because of the incompatibility between the mouse and human Fey receptor system an alternative approach is to use a murine SCID model in which immune deficient mice are engrafted with human PBLs or PBMCs huPBL SCID huPBMC SCID providing a semi functional human immune system with human effector cells and Fc receptors. Other organisms e.g. mammals may also be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models and thus may be used to test the efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics or other property of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein. Tests of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics and or other clinical properties.

In some embodiments immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be assessed for efficacy in clinically relevant animal models of various human diseases. In many cases relevant models include various transgenic animals for specific antigens and receptors.

In one embodiment the testing of immunoglobulins may include study of efficacy in primates e.g. cynomolgus monkey model to facilitate the evaluation of depletion of specific target cells harboring the target antigen. Additional primate models include but are not limited to use of the rhesus monkey to assess immunoglobulins in therapeutic studies of autoimmune transplantation and cancer.

Toxicity studies are performed to determine drug related effects that cannot be evaluated in standard pharmacology profiles or occur only after repeated administration of the agent. Most toxicity tests are performed in two species a rodent and a non rodent to ensure that any unexpected adverse effects are not overlooked before new therapeutic entities are introduced into man. In general these models may measure a variety of toxicities including genotoxicity chronic toxicity immunogenicity reproductive developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity. Included within the aforementioned parameters are standard measurement of food consumption bodyweight antibody formation clinical chemistry and macro and microscopic examination of standard organs tissues e.g. cardiotoxicity . Additional parameters of measurement are injection site trauma and the measurement of neutralizing antibodies if any. Traditionally monoclonal antibody therapeutics naked or conjugated is evaluated for cross reactivity with normal tissues immunogenicity antibody production conjugate or linker toxicity and bystander toxicity of radiolabelled species. Nonetheless such studies may have to be individualized to address specific concerns and following the guidance set by ICH S6 Safety studies for biotechnological products also noted above . As such the general principles are that the products are sufficiently well characterized impurities contaminants have been removed that the test material is comparable throughout development and that GLP compliance is maintained.

The pharmacokinetics PK of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be studied in a variety of animal systems with the most relevant being non human primates such as the cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys. Single or repeated i.v. s.c. administrations over a dose range of 6000 fold 0.05 300 mg kg can be evaluated for half life days to weeks using plasma concentration and clearance. Volume of distribution at a steady state and level of systemic absorbance can also be measured. Examples of such parameters of measurement generally include maximum observed plasma concentration Cmax the time to reach Cmax Tmax the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity AUC 0 inf and apparent elimination half life T . Additional measured parameters could include compartmental analysis of concentration time data obtained following i.v. administration and bioavailability.

Pharmacodynamic studies may include but are not limited to targeting specific cells or blocking signaling mechanisms measuring inhibition of antigen specific antibodies etc. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may target particular effector cell populations and thereby be direct drugs to induce certain activities to improve potency or to increase penetration into a particularly favorable physiological compartment. Such pharmacodynamic effects may be demonstrated in animal models or in humans.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may find use in a wide range of products. In one embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein is a therapeutic a diagnostic or a research reagent. The immunoglobulins may find use in a composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used for therapeutic purposes. As will be appreciated by those in the art the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used for any therapeutic purpose that antibodies Fc fusions and the like may be used for. The immunoglobulins may be administered to a patient to treat disorders including but not limited to cancer infectious diseases autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

A patient for the purposes disclosed herein includes both humans and other animals e.g. other mammals. Thus the immunoglobulins disclosed herein have both human therapy and veterinary applications. The term treatment or treating as disclosed herein is meant to include therapeutic treatment as well as prophylactic or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus for example successful administration of an immunoglobulin prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example successful administration of an optimized immunoglobulin after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Treatment and treating also encompasses administration of an optimized immunoglobulin after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Those in need of treatment include mammals already having the disease or disorder as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented.

In one embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein is administered to a patient having a disease involving inappropriate expression of a protein or other molecule. Within the scope disclosed herein this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present protein localization posttranslational modification conformational state the presence of a mutant or pathogen protein etc. Similarly the disease or disorder may be characterized by alterations molecules including but not limited to polysaccharides and gangliosides. An overabundance may be due to any cause including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action mutant forms of a protein or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression appearance or activity of a protein and said measurement may play an important role in the development and or clinical testing of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

The immunoglobulins herein may be used to treat cancer. By cancer and cancerous herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

Variants that promote Fc heterodimerization and disfavor homodimerization were designed using a combination of computational structure based and rational protein engineering approaches. Computational structure based methods PDA technology were used to evaluate possible amino acid substitutions in the CH3 region for their ability to stabilize Fc heterodimers and destabilize Fc homodimers. Amino acid energies for selected pairs of positions were calculated in the context of the heterodimer both variant amino acids and the two homodimers variant amino acid at one position and the wild type amino acid at the other . Energies were normalized against the calculated energy of the wild type amino acid pair. The preference for the heterodimeric species was calculated using the following two equations Heterodimer Preference 1 heterodimer max homodimer 1 homodimer 2 Heterodimer Preference 2 heterodimer min homodimer 1 homodimer 2 

Of particular interest are those variants for which one or both of the heterodimer preferences are negative. This indicates that the heterodimer is predicted to be more stable than one or both of the homodimers.

In order to screen for Fc variants that favor heterodimerization an empty Fc scFv Fc system was developed as a test system illustrated in . DNA constructs were designed encoding two different immunoglobulin polypeptides i scFv Fc VH linker V Hinge CH2 CH3 and ii empty Fc Hinge CH2 CH3 . Here the two different CH3 domains CH3 prime and CH3 double prime represent the different variant versions that were designed to promote heterodimer formation and discourage homodimer formation. As shown in cotransfection and expression of these two polypeptides results in three possible dimers. Each of the three dimers is composed of a unique number of immunoglobulin Ig domains and thus unique molecular weights. Consequently the population of each species can be visualized using gel electrophoresis. provides amino acid sequences of the scFv Fc and empty Fc constructs along with sequences of native IgG s.

The scFv Fc empty Fc system was tested using wild type IgG1 Fc regions and an scFv derived from a murine anti CD3 antibody OKT3 Kjer Nielsen et al. 2004 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 7675 7680 . DNA encoding the OKT3 scFv was generated by gene synthesis Integrated DNA Technologies . All constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pTT5 Durocher et al. 2002 Nucleic acids research 30 E9 using standard molecular biology techniques. scFv Fc and empty Fc constructs with native IgG1 Fc regions were cotransfected into HEK293E cells Durocher et al. 2002 Nucleic Acids Research 30 E9 for expression and resulting protein was purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography. The protein species generated were visualized electrophoretically using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer microfluidics based platform Agilent Technologies . Agilent chips for SDS PAGE were run on the BioAnalyzer using kit 5067 1517 lot NA06BP01 containing gels chips and buffers carried out using the manufacturer s instructions. Samples were run in duplicate one under reducing and the other under non reducing conditions. Results are shown in . The 240 kilodalton KDa band in all of the gel lanes represents a protein in the loading buffer used as a normalization standard. Under reducing conditions lanes 1 5 two bands were observed corresponding to scFv Fc monomer and empty Fc monomer. Under non reducing conditions lanes 6 10 three bands were observed corresponding to scFv Fc homodimer scFc Fv empty Fc heterodimer and empty Fc homodimer. This result confirmed the ability to detect each of the different protein species indicating the scFv Fc empty Fc system provided a good system for quantification of the degree of heterodimerization from designed Fc variants.

A DNA library encoding variant immunoglobulin polypeptides designed as described above was constructed in the scFv Fc and empty Fc constructs. Pairs of scFv Fc and empty Fc constructs were cotransfected into HEK293E cells for expression and resulting proteins were purified using protein A affinity chromatography. Relative concentrations of the expressed protein species were determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer microfluidics based platform as described above. Resulting gels are shown in . A quantitative summary of the results from this library is provided in . A number of designed variants increased the content of heterodimer relative to that of the native parent Fc region.

Using the information obtained from the previous library a new library was designed and screened as described above. Quantitative electrophoretic results are shown in . A number of designed variants increased the content of heterodimer relative to that of the native parent Fc region. Preferred and most preferred variants from this screen are listed in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.

Heterodimerization of distinct immunoglobulin heavy chains provides a novel beneficial approach to bispecific co targeting of antigens. The capacity to co engage multiple antigens particularly the capacity to link binding of a target antigen to activation of a cellular receptor offers the potential to enhance the clinical efficacy of antibody therapeutics as well as engineer novel mechanisms of action. Yet an important property of bispecifics that engage many immune receptors is activation only in proximity to the primary or first target antigen. Biologically the immune system accomplishes this naturally via monovalent binding of an immune receptor to its cognate ligand often at low affinity. Cellular activation occurs only by cross linking achieved typically by antibody antigen immune complexes or via effector cell to target cell engagement. For some immune receptors for example the CD3 signaling receptor on T cells activation only upon engagement with co engaged target is critical as nonspecific cross linking can elicit a cytokine storm and toxicity Perruche et al. 2009 J Immunol 183 2 953 61 . An engineering solution as described here is to engage such immune receptors monovalently rather than multivalently such that activation occurs in response to cross linking only in the presence of the primary target antigen.

The low affinity Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs such as Fc RIIa Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa bind monovalently to the antibody Fc region. Monovalent binding does not activate cells expressing these Fc Rs however cell to cell contact leads to receptor cross linking and clustering on the cell surface leading to activation. For Fc RIIIa CD16 expressed on natural killer NK cells target cell killing is mediated by receptor cross linking and cellular activation which occurs when the effector cell engages the target cell in a highly avid format Bowles Weiner 2005 J Immunol Methods 304 88 99 M rquez et al. 2010 Cell Immunol 264 1 86 92 expressly incorporated by reference . In this regard Fc RIIIa co targeting is a particularly good application of the mAb Fv format which is capable of engaging target antigen bivalently while co engaging Fc RIIIa monovalently.

mAb Fv and mAb Fab immunoglobulins that co target Fc RIIIa were constructed using the variable region of the anti human Fc RIIIa antibody 3G8 as Fv 2. A variety of constructs were generated that target various primary antigens antigen 1 including the solid tumor antigens Her2 and EGFR and the myeloma antigen HM1.24. Antibody variable regions targeting these antigens were obtained from the anti Her2 antibody trastuzumab Carter et al. 1992 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89 4285 4289 a humanized version of the anti EGFR antibody C225 U.S. Ser. No. 11 004 054 and a humanized version of the anti HM1.24 antibody HM1.24 U.S. Ser. No. 11 857 310 . The different constructs incorporated a variety of linker compositions and lengths and a number of them incorporated hetero Fc variants that favor heterodimerization. In addition in order to engineer selectivity to Fc RIIIa relative to other Fc receptors several constructs utilized knockout Fc variants that ablate binding to Fc Rs and complement. In addition some constructs incorporated detection purification tags on the C termini including His tags HHHHHH and Flag tags DYKDDDDK . The anti Fc RIIIa Fc RIIIa mAb Fv and mAb Fab constructs are listed in Table 3 along with a description of their relevant components. Each immunoglobulin is given an identification number ID . Amino acid sequences of these immunoglobulins are listed in . Also included in Table 3 are control antibodies used as controls and comparators in the anti Her2 experiments. These include an IgG1 version of trastuzumab as well as variants with ablated G236R L328R and enhanced S239D I332E binding to Fc R s including Fc RIIIa.

The immunoglobulins in Table 3 were constructed using a combination of gene synthesis Blue Heron Biotechnology Bothell Wash. PCR subcloning quick change mutagenesis and other standard molecular biology methods. All DNA was constructed in the context of the expression vector pTT5 Durocher et al. 2002 Nucleic acids research 30 E9 using standard molecular biology techniques. Heavy and light chains for each immunoglobulin were cotransfected into HEK293E cells Durocher et al. 2002 Nucleic Acids Research 30 E9 for expression and resulting protein was purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography.

The proteins were visualized electrophoretically using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer microfluidics based platform Agilent Technologies . Agilent chips for SDS PAGE were run on the BioAnalyzer using kit 5067 1517 lot NA06BP01 containing gels chips and buffers carried out using the manufacturer s instructions. Samples were in duplicate one under reducing and the other under non reducing conditions. Representative gels are shown in . As expected under reducing conditions three bands were observed at the approximate calculated molecular weights corresponding to the light chain 25 KDa and two heavy chains 65 KDa for each mAb Fv. Under non reducing conditions a single main band at 180 KDa was observed for each mAb Fv and 200 KDa for the mAb Fab corresponding to the tetrameric immunoglobulin two heavy chains each complexed with a light chain . The results are consistent for the three anti Fc RIIIa constructs co targeting Her2 EGFR and HM1.24 indicating the broad applicability of the mAb Fv format for co engaging targets.

The immunoglobulins were analyzed using size exclusion chromatography SEC to measure their size more correctly their hydrodynamic volume and determine the native like behavior of the purified samples. These experiments used an Agilent 1200 High performance liquid chromatography HPLC system. Samples were injected onto a Superdex 200 10 300 GL column model 17 5175 01 lot 10034171 Amersham at 0.5 mLs min using 1 PBS pH 7.4 as the mobile phase. Results for select mAb Fv samples are shown in . A molecular weight standard was run not shown . All of the mAb Fv samples showed a main peak at an elution time that based on the molecular weight standard corresponded to the approximate molecular weight of the tetrameric mAb Fv heterodimer heavy chain species 180 KDa . The symmetry of the peaks and the relatively low populations of other species for all of the anti Fc RIIIa mAb Fv s Her2 EGFR and HM1.24 indicated that the immunoglobulin format is robust.

The 9516 anti Her2 anti Fc RIIIa Her2 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv was constructed in the context of an IgG1 comprising the knockout Fc variant Fc KO G236R L328R in order to engineer selective Fc RIIIa binding. In other words binding of the Fc region to all of the Fc Rs and complement was ablated and then only Fc RIIIa binding was built back as antigen 2 in the mAb Fv format. Binding of 9516 and control antibodies Native IgG1 and Fc KO to the relevant human Fc R s was tested using surface plasmon resonance Biacore . Binding measurements were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument Biacore . Antibodies were captured onto an immobilized Protein A Pierce CM5 biosensor chip Biacore generated using a standard primary amine coupling protocol. All measurements were performed in HBS EP 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4 0.15 M NaCl 3 mM EDTA 0.005 v v surfactant P20 and glycine buffer 10 mM glycine HCl pH 1.5 was used for the Protein A surface regeneration. All antibodies 50 nM in HBS EP were immobilized on the Protein A surface. Fc receptors were injected over antibody bound surface followed by a dissociation phase. After each cycle the Protein A surface was regenerated by injecting glycine buffer pH 1.5 . Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of receptor and by subtracting appropriate nonspecific signals response of reference channel and injection of running buffer . The results in show that while native IgG1 binds to all of the Fc Rs the Fc KO variant is ablated for binding to all of the Fc Rs. Similar to the Fc KO the 9516 Her2 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv is ablated for binding to Fc RI Fc RIIa and Fc RIIb however in contrast to the knockout variant antibody 9516 has strong affinity for Fc RIIIa due to the engineered Fv 2 binding site. The kinetic off rate of dissociation k for Fc RIIIa binding is slower than that of native IgG1 a consequence of the greater affinity of the 3G8 variable region for the receptor relative to the IgG1 Fc region.

The neonatal Fc receptor FcRn protects IgG from degradation and is responsible in part for the long half life 21 days for IgG1 of antibodies in circulation. FcRn binds at a site on the Fc region separate from the binding site for Fc Rs and the Fc KO variant G236R L328R does not impact FcRn affinity. Binding to FcRn by the 9516 mAb Fv and control antibodies was tested using a Biacore method similar to above except that a Her2 antigen capture chip format was used the protein A binding site on Fc overlaps with the site for FcRn . As can be seen in binding of the mAb Fv to FcRn was uncompromised relative to native IgG1 and the Fc KO variant.

Affinity of the mAb Fv for Fc RIIIa was measured using Biacore . The protein A capture format was used as described above except that sensorgrams were obtained for a concentration series of receptor analyte in order to calculate an accurate affinity. shows Biacore sensorgrams depicting the binding of various concentrations of the V158 isoform of Fc RIIIa to protein A captured 9516 mAb Fv. Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of receptor and by subtracting appropriate nonspecific signals response of reference channel and injection of running buffer . The equilibrium constant was calculated by global fitting of binding data with a 1 1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software. The Her2 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv bound Fc RIIIa with an equilibrium constant of dissociation Kd of 110 nM approximately 2.5 fold tighter than the 280 nM affinity of native IgG1 Richards et al. 2008 Mol Cancer Ther 7 8 2517 27 consistent with the slower dissociation observed relative to native IgG1 .

Co engagement of Her2 and Fc RIIIa by the 9516 mAb Fv was confirmed using a Biacore experiment similar to as described above but using Her2 capture instead of protein A. 100 nM concentration of the 9516 mAb Fv was captured to a HER2 chip followed by injection of 200 nM V158 Fc RIIIa analyte. Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of 9516. The results in demonstrate the simultaneous co engagement of Her2 by the Fv 1 region and Fc RIIIa by the Fv 2 region. Engagement of Fc receptor is not due to binding by the Fc region which due to the Fc KO variant is ablated for binding to all of the Fc receptors .

Similar binding experiments were carried out for the HM1.24 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv. The protein A capture format was used with a receptor analyte concentration series to calculate the affinity of the 9518 mAb Fv for V158 Fc RIIIa. shows Biacore sensorgrams depicting the binding of receptor at various concentrations to protein A captured 9518 mAb Fv. Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of receptor and by subtracting appropriate nonspecific signals. The equilibrium constant was calculated by global fitting of binding data with a 1 1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software. The HM1.24 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv bound V158 Fc RIIIa with an equilibrium constant of dissociation Kd of 96 nM approximately 2.9 fold tighter than the 280 nM affinity of native IgG1 Richards et al. 2008 Mol Cancer Ther 7 8 2517 27 .

Co engagement of HM1.24 and Fc RIIIa by the 9518 mAb Fv was confirmed using the antigen capture Biacore method as described above. 100 nM concentration of the 9518 mAb Fv was captured to a HM1.24 chip followed by injection of 200 nM V158 Fc RIIIa analyte. Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of 9516. The results in demonstrate the simultaneous co engagement of HM1.24 by the Fv 1 region and Fc RIIIa by the Fv 2 region.

A cytotoxicity assay was carried out to test the capacity of the Her2 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv to mediate cellular killing against Her2 expressing cells. A native IgG1 version of the anti Her2 antibody trastuzumab was run as a control and an Fc variant version S239D I332E with enhanced Fc RIIIa binding was also tested as a comparator. An anti respiratory syncytial virus RSV antibody with the variable region of motavizumab with the S239D I332E Fc region served as a negative control for lack of binding to Her2. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were purified from leukopacks using a Ficoll gradient. Her2SK BR 3 breast carcinoma cells were seeded into 96 well plates and opsonized with mAb Fv or control comparator antibodies at the indicated concentrations. Triton X 100 and PBMC alone were run as controls. Effector cells were added at 50 1 PBMC target cells and plates were incubated at 37 C. for 4 h. Cell lysis was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release using the Cytotox ONE Homogeneous Membrane Integrity Assay Promega . Cells were incubated with lactate dehydrogenase reaction mixture for 10 min. and fluorescence was measured using a Wallac Victor2 fluorometer Perkin Elmer . Fluorescence was normalized to minimal PBMC alone and maximal Triton lysis and fit to a sigmoidal dose response. The results are shown in . The Her2 Fc RIIIa mAb Fv mediated a level of lysis substantially enhanced relative to native IgG1 trastuzumab and comparable to the Fc enhanced variant S239D I332E. The results confirm the high affinity Fc RIIIa antigen 2 binding mediated by novel engineered Fv 2 binding site and demonstrate the capacity of the mAb Fv format for enabling selective and optimal functions.

The inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb downregulates cellular activation of B cells monocytes mast cells and other immune cell types. On B cells inhibitory activity is elicited only when Fc RIIb rengages into an immune complex with the cell surface B cell receptor BCR a mechanism that is mediated by immune complexation of soluble IgG s with the same antigen that is recognized by the BCR Heyman 2003 Immunol Lett 88 2 157 161 Smith and Clatworthy 2010 Nature Reviews Immunology 10 328 343 expressly incorporated by reference . We explored the applicability of the mAb Fv format for engaging Fc RIIb monovalently while bivalently co engaging an antigen in the BCR complex specifically CD19. This immunomodulatory co engagement mechanism is described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 156 183 filed May 30 2008 entitled Methods and Compositions for Inhibiting CD32b Expressing Cells herein expressly incorporated by reference. Other co targets for the Fc RIIb mediated immunomodulatory mechanism include other antigens involved with the BCR or components of its coreceptor complex including for example CD21 CD22 CD72 CD79a CD79b and CD81 as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 156 183.

mAb Fv immunoglobulins that co target Fc RIIb were constructed using as Fv 2 the variable region of 2B6 an antibody selective for the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb as Fv 2 Veri et al. 2007 Immunology 121 392 404 . Targeting of CD19 antigen by Fv 1 utilized a humanized affinity matured version of the anti CD19 antibody 4G7 described previously U.S. Ser. No. 12 156 183 . The different constructs incorporated a gly ser repeat linker and knockout Fc variants in order to engineer selectivity to Fc RIIb relative to other Fc receptors. The mAb Fv constructs utilized either native CH3 domains ID 9506 or hetero Fc variants ID 9547 . The anti Fc RIIb Fc RIIb mAb Fv and constructs are listed in Table 4 along with a description of their relevant components. Amino acid sequences of these immunoglobulins are listed in . Also included in Table 4 is a control antibody ID 6187 containing the knockout variant used in these experiments.

The immunoglobulins in Table 4 were constructed as described above in the pTT5 expression vector. Heavy and light chains for each immunoglobulin were cotransfected into HEK293E cells for expression and resulting protein was purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography as described above.

The proteins were analyzed using electrophoresis using the Agilent Bioanalyzer as described above. SDS PAGE results are shown in . Although the 9506 construct comprising the homodimeric Fc region expressed poorly faint bands could nonetheless be observed approximately at the expected molecular weights of the light chain 25 KDa and two heavy chains 65 KDa . Likewise under non reducing conditions a single main band was observed for at the expected molecular weight of the tetrameric protein two heavy chains each complexed with a light chain 180 KDa . Proper assembly of the mAb Fv was supported by the SEC results data not shown . The 9547 construct was identical 9506 except that it contained the Fc variants Y349T T394F on one heavy chain and S364H F405A on the other heavy chain to favor heterodimerization. Multiple bands were observed for 9547 in the SDS PAGE gels. Bands were observed approximately at the expected molecular weights of the light chain and two heavy chains and under non reducing conditions a band was observed at the expected molecular weight of the tetrameric immunoglobulin. Assembly of the mAb Fv was supported by the presence of an SEC peak that corresponded to the approximate molecular weight of the tetrameric mAb Fv heterodimer species data not shown . The size of the additional band in the non reducing gel suggested a significant population of a monomeric heavy chain light chain pair 90 KDa . Thus due to the hetero Fc variants heavy chain monomers complexed with light chain are observed rather than homodimeric heavy chain species. Based on the intensity of the bands in the gel this result appears to be due to differential expression between the two heavy chains. We suspect the poor expression of one of the heavy chains relative to the other is due to a glycosylation site in the 2B6 VL region U.S. Ser. No. 12 349 876 . Regardless the results from the gels and SEC indicate a significant population of the designed heterodimeric mAb Fv species.

Affinity of the 9547 CD19 Fc RIIb mAb Fv was measured using Biacore as described above. shows Biacore sensorgrams depicting the binding of various concentrations of Fc RIIb to protein A captured 9547 mAb Fv. Data were processed and fitted as described above. The CD19 Fc RIIb mAb Fv bound Fc RIIb with a Kd of 44 nM approximately 52 fold tighter than the 2.3 AA affinity of native IgG1 Richards et al. 2008 Mol Cancer Ther 7 8 2517 27 . Because 9547 was constructed in the context of the knockout Fc variant G236R L328R binding to of the mAb Fv is selective for Fc RIIb i.e. it binds the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb with high affinity but does not bind any of the activating Fc Rs.

The 9547 mAb Fv and 6187 control antibody were assayed for capacity to inhibit BCR mediated B cell activation as a result of BCR Fc RIIb co engagement. This mechanism of B cell inhibition has been described previously U.S. Ser. No. 12 156 183 . Intracellular calcium mobilization was used as a quantitative measure of BCR mediated B cell activation. Intracellular free calcium concentration Ca was measured by flow cytometry using a Fluo 4 NW calcium assay Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. . PBMCs were resuspended in calcium assay buffer and pre loaded with Fluo 4 dye for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with immunoglobulin of interest cells were stimulated by addition of 10 g ml of anti CD79b antibody. Calcium flux kinetics was recorded using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo software Tree Star Ashland Oreg. . The data are plotted as the change of Mean Fluo 4 Intensity MFI over time. The results are shown in . CD19 Fc RIIb mAb Fv inhibited calcium mobilization induced by BCR crosslinking relative to the 6187 Fc KO CD19 antibody. This activity is attributed to the high affinity 44 nM Fc RIIb co engagement of the inhibitory receptor with BCR associated CD19 antigen. The result further demonstrates the capacity of the mAb Fv format for enabling selective and novel functional activities.

CD3 activation of T cells occurs only when its associated T cell receptor TCR engages antigen loaded MHC on antigen presenting cells in a highly avid cell to cell synapse Kuhns et al. 2006 Immunity 24 133 139 . Because cross linking of CD3 using an anti CD3 antibody elicits a cytokine storm and toxicity Perruche et al. 2009 J Immunol 183 2 953 61 Chatenoud Bluestone 2007 Nature Reviews Immunology 7 622 632 expressly incorporated by reference for practical clinical use the preferred mode of CD3 co engagement for redirected killing of targets cells is monovalent binding that results in activation only upon engagement with the co engaged primary target. The mAb Fv format is particularly well suited for this mechanistic approach. We explored the applicability of the mAb Fv format for engaging CD3 monovalently while bivalently co engaging tumor cell antigens.

mAb Fv immunoglobulins that co target CD3 were constructed using as the Fv 2 variable region a humanized version of the anti CD3 antibody OKT3. Fv 1 regions targeted the antigens Her2 HM1.24 and CD19 using the variable regions described above. A variety of constructs were generated co targeting these primary antigens bivalently and CD3 monovalently that incorporated different linker compositions and lengths hetero Fc variants that favor heterodimerization and knockout Fc variants to ablate binding to Fc Rs and complement. Constructs also incorporated H is and Flag tags at the C termini as potential detection purification tags. The CD3 mAb Fv constructs are listed in Table 5 along with a description of their relevant components. Amino acid sequences of these immunoglobulins are listed in .

The immunoglobulins in Table 5 were constructed as described above in the pTT5 expression vector. Heavy and light chains for each immunoglobulin were cotransfected into HEK293E cells for expression and resulting protein was purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography as described above.

The proteins were visualized electrophoretically using the Agilent Bioanalyzer as described above. Representative gels are shown in . As expected under reducing conditions three bands were observed at the approximate calculated molecular weights corresponding to the light chain 25 KDa and two heavy chains 65 KDa for each mAb Fv. Under non reducing conditions a main band was observed for each immunoglobulin 180 KDa corresponding to the tetrameric mAb Fv species two heavy chains each complexed with a light chain . The additional band in the non reducing gels for 9550 9551 and 9552 is attributed to monomeric heavy chain light chain pair 90 KDa similar to as was observed for the CD19 Fc RIIb mAb Fv. Nonetheless based on the band intensities of the CD3 mAb Fv s the heterodimeric heavy chain complexes are the dominant species for the 9550 9551 and 9552 constructs.

The immunoglobulins were analyzed using SEC to measure their size and test the native like behavior of the purified samples as described above. Results for select mAb Fv samples are shown in . The mAb Fv samples showed a main peak at an elution time that based on a molecular weight standard not shown corresponded to the approximate molecular weight of the tetrameric mAb Fv species 180 KDa . The symmetry of the peaks and dominant population of the proper species for all of the CD3 mAb Fv s Her2 CD19 and HM1.24 indicated that the mAb Fv format is robust for co engagement of CD3 antigen. Consistent with the SDS PAGE results 9551 showed an additional smaller peak at a later elution time attributed to the presence of monomeric heavy chain light chain pairs.

Affinity of the 9509 Her2 CD3 mAb Fv for CD3T cells was measured using a competition experiment with labeled OKT3 antibody. 9509 mAb Fv at various concentrations was pre incubated with 0.8 million PBMC on ice for 1 hour. Commercial FITC labeled OKT3 was added to 50 ng ml for 45 minutes. The binding buffer was 3 FBS PBS and samples were washed twice before fixing with 1 Paraformaldehyde PBS. Binding of OKT3 FITC to T cells was detected on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer BD Biosciences by analyzing CD16CD20lymphocytes based on front scatter FSS and side scatter SSC scattering pattern that were negative for CD16 and CD20 using commercial labeled anti CD16 and anti CD20 antibody reagents. The results in demonstrate dose dependent binding of the Her2 CD3 mAb Fv to T cells.

Previous groups have demonstrated CD3 mediated cytotoxic killing by bispecific antibody fragments that co engage CD3 and various target antigens reviewed in Baeuerle Reinhardt 2009 Cancer Res 69 12 4941 4 . We tested the capacity of the CD3 co engaging mAb Fv s to mediate cytotoxic killing against tumor cells expressing Her2 and HM1.24. Cytotoxicity assays were carried out as above monitoring cell lysis by lactate dehydrogenase LDH release as described.

 Her2 CD3 mAb Fv s utilized purified T cells as effectors. T cells were purified using a T Cell Enrichment Kit from Stemcell Technologies Vancouver Canada . The 9509 Her2 CD3 mAb Fv was tested against Her2 SK BR 3 breast carcinoma cells at an effector to target ratio of 200 000 T cells to 10 000 target cells. Incubation time was 24 hrs. The 9551 HM1.24 CD3 mAb Fv was used as a negative control. The results in show strong CD3 mediated cytotoxicity against the Her2 target cells mediated by the Her2 directed mAb Fv while the HM1.24 directed mAb Fv showed no killing activity. The 9344 Her2 CD3 mAb Fv was tested against Her2 SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells at an effector to target ratio of 250 000 T cells to 10 000 target cells. Incubation time was 24 hrs. Here the Her2 IgG1 WT antibody trastuzumab was used as a negative control. The results in show strong CD3 mediated killing against the target cells by the mAb Fv. In contrast the WT IgG1 anti Her2 antibody showed no capacity to mediate cytotoxic activity by the isolated T cells.

The 9551 HM1.24 CD3 mAb Fv was tested for CD3 mediated cytotoxic activity using purified PBMCs. Because this mAb Fv contains the knockout variant Fc region G236R L328R it does not have the capacity to mediate Fc R mediated cytotoxic activity by other immune cells in the heterogeneous PBMC mixture. Both knockout variant 6166 and WT IgG1 5627 anti HM1.24 antibodies were tested as controls. In this experiment HM1.24RPMI 8224 myeloma cells were used as targets seeded at 10 000 per well and 500 000 PBMCs were added as effectors at a 50 1 effector target cell ratio. Incubation time for this assay was 23 hrs. The results in show that the HM1.24 CD3 mAb Fv mediated strong cytotoxic activity against the tumor cells. The 6166 Fc knockout anti HM1.24 antibody was completely devoid of activity consistent with it s lack of Fc R binding and of course its inability as a native antibody to co engage CD3. The 5627 WT IgG1 anti HM1.24 antibody mediated very weak ADCC activity if any at all presumably due to Fc RIIIa mediated killing by NK cells in the PBMC mixture. The dramatic CD3 mediated activity of the mAb Fv relative to the Fc R mediated activity of the normal IgG1 antibody targeting the same antigen demonstrates the potential of the novel formats herein for enabling powerful functional activities.
