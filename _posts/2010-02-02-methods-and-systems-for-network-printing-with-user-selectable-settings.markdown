title: Methods and systems for network printing with user selectable settings
abstract: Methods and systems for network printing using user selectable printer settings for a variety of configurations of printing systems and finishers. A printing system such as a multi-function printer/device receives user input providing a document identifier (e.g., a release code) identifying a document stored in a network storage server. The printing system also identifies a finisher unit associated with the printing system. The printing system sends the document identifier and a finisher identifier to a print server. The print server determines available printer settings associated with the identified finisher unit and transmits a presentation to the printing system prompting the user to select a desired printer setting. The selected printer settings are transmitted to the print server. The print server retrieves a copy of the identified document and modifies the copy based on the selected printer setting. The modified copy of the document is sent to the printing system to be printed.

The invention relates generally to network printing e.g. cloud printing and more specifically relates to methods and systems for improved network printing using a printing system e.g. a multi function printer scanner copier device etc. where the network print server enables user selection of printer settings specific to the printing system s present configuration.

 Cloud computing generally encompasses processing and or storage of data based on the Internet or based on an enterprise intra net. For example cloud computing may encompass the concepts of Software as a Service SaaS cloud storage and cloud printing. SaaS provides an application as a service for a customer to use on demand. Cloud storage generally encompasses the concept of providing delivering data storage as a service with the customer being billed for storage usage under a utility computing model similar to traditional public utilities including electricity . Cloud printing generally encompasses a client process accessing a document from a cloud storage server and causing the document to print. As with cloud storage a cloud printing user could be charged for the number of pages processed and or printed. Often the client process in such cloud printing is the printing system itself on which a user interface allows a user to select a document to be retrieved and printed.

Cloud storage servers generally store a document in a generic portable format i.e. often in the Portable Document Format PDF . The PDF format is not intended to be formatted for any particular printing system but rather is intended as just the opposite a generic format that may be usable on most any printing or display system. Thus the printing system per se or a print server coupled with the printing system and coupled with the cloud storage server must perform any customized formatting or finishing desired by a user when printing a document in a cloud printing environment. Since the processing for customized formatting or finishing may require substantial processing power it is most common to couple the printing system with a print server that will provide desired formatting e.g. as a SaaS application .

Where a print server is used to process formatting or finishing options it is a problem for the print server to provide sufficient flexibility to permit a user to fully customize the formatting or finishing options of a document to be printed. Each printing system coupled with the print server may have a particular configuration. Each printing system model may have a different set of printer settings that may be used to control formatting of a document to be printed. Further each printing system may have one or more optional finisher units coupled with the printing system. Finisher units generally provide post processing of a printed document and may provide for example stapling features hole punching features binding features folding features etc. Thus it is a problem for the print server to enable a user the full flexibility of selecting any document processing finishing features but also limit the options to only those printer settings actually available on the printing system as presently configured.

Thus it is an ongoing challenge in cloud printing to provide flexibility in the selection of printer settings in a printing system adapted to provide cloud printing capabilities through use of a print server.

The present invention solves the above and other problems thereby advancing the state of the useful arts by providing methods and systems for flexible definition of available printer settings for a printing system as presently configured for network printing. The printing system and the print server exchange messages to inform the print server of the present configuration of the printing system regarding finisher units. The print server then customizes a user interface presentation e.g. display screen to prompt the user to select desired printer settings from among only those printer settings available on the printing system as presently configured. Based on the user s selected printer settings a requested document is retrieved and modified by the print server to effectuate the user s desired printer settings and to cause the modified document to be printed on the printing system.

One aspect hereof provides a method operable in a printing system for network printing of a document. The method includes selecting a document to be printed. The document is stored in a network storage server coupled with the printing system. The method also includes determining a finisher identifier associated with a finishing unit presently configured with the printing system and transmitting the finisher identifier to the print server. The method then receives from the print server a user interface presentation generated to present available printer settings based on the finisher identifier. The method then presents the user interface presentation to a user of the printing system and receives user input selecting a printer setting for printing the document. The printer setting is selected from the available printer settings presented to the user. The selected printer setting is then transmitted to the print server and a modified document is returned from the print server. The modified document comprising the document modified based on the selected printer setting. The modified document is then printed.

Another aspect hereof provides a method operable in a print server for network printing of a document on a printing system. The method includes receiving from the printing system coupled to the print server a document identifier that identifies the document stored in a network storage server and receiving from the printing system a finisher identifier associated with a finishing unit currently configured with the printing system. The method then generates a user interface presentation that presents available printer settings based on the finisher identifier and transmits the generated user interface presentation to the printing system. The method then receives from the printing system a selected printer setting for printing the document. The printer setting is selected from the available printer settings transmitted to the printing system. The method also includes retrieving a copy of the document from a network storage server based on the document identifier and modifying the retrieved copy of the document based on the selected printer setting. The modified copy of the document is then transmitted to the printing system to be printed by the printing system.

Still another aspect hereof provides a system comprising a printing system. The printing system comprising a printing engine for printing a document and a finishing unit adapted to process printed documents generated by the printing engine. The finishing unit having one or more printer setting associated with controlling its operation. The printing system also includes a user interface device for presenting information to a user and for receiving input from a user and a controller coupled with the printing system and coupled with the finisher unit and coupled with the user interface device. The controller is adapted to control operation of the printing system. The system also includes a print server coupled with the printing system and adapted to couple with a network storage server. The controller is adapted to transmit to the print server a document identifier identifying a document to be printed and is further adapted to transmit to the print server a finisher identifier for the finishing unit. The print server is adapted to transmit to the controller a user interface presentation that presents available printer settings based on the finisher identifier. The controller is further adapted to present the user interface presentation on the user interface device and adapted to receive user input through the user interface device selecting a printer setting from the presented available printer settings. The controller is further adapted to transmit the selected printer setting to the print server and the print server is further adapted to retrieve a copy of the document identified by the document identifier from a network storage server. The print server is further adapted to modify the copy of the document based on the selected printer setting and to transmit the modified copy of the document to the controller. The controller is further adapted to print the modified copy of the document using the printing engine and the finisher unit.

Printing system also includes controller coupled with printing engine with finishing unit and with user interface to control overall operation of printing system . Controller is also adapted to provide communications with external computing systems and servers. Controller may be any suitable electronic or computing device adapted to control overall operation of printing system and further adapted to provide communications with print server . Controller may include a general or special purpose processor coupled with suitable memory for storing instructions to be executed as well as associated data. Controller may also include suitable communication interface circuits to couple with printing engine finishing unit user interface and print server .

System also includes enhanced print server adapted to provide documents or images to be printed by printing system . Print server may be any suitable computing device including personal computers workstations and servers. Print server is adapted to generate documents to be printed and further adapted to communicate with printing system e.g. via controller of printing system to exchange information including for example document content to be printed status information and commands.

Enhanced print server may be coupled with cloud storage server i.e. a network storage server to retrieve copies of documents to be printed by printing system . Cloud storage server may be any suitable computing device including personal computers workstations and servers. Cloud storage server is adapted to store documents and or images to be printed. In some embodiments cloud storage server may be accessed by print server through a public network such as the Internet. In other embodiments cloud storage server may communicate with print server through an intra net enterprise network. For example the storage server may comprise a network attached storage NAS unit and or a storage area network SAN unit. Exemplary commercial cloud storage service providers include Amazon S3 Nirvanix and DocumentMall. Cloud storage server may also comprise part of a photo sharing web sites such as Picasa Web Albums.

In one exemplary embodiment system also includes a printer settings memory associated with print server . The printer settings memory is adapted to store available printer settings for one or more printing systems and for one or more finisher units. Printer settings memory may be integrated within print server or may be external with respect to print server . Printer settings memory may be any suitable memory device including volatile and nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices as well as disk storage devices such as magnetic disk storage and or optical disk storage.

In one exemplary embodiment print server may provide Software as a Service SaaS features in communicating with one or more printing systems . Thus print server may communicate with printing system through a public network such as the Internet or may be a local server communicating with printing system through an intra net of an enterprise.

In operation of system a user of printing system interacts with controller through user interface to select a document to be printed. Controller also determines one or more finishing unit identifiers each identifying a corresponding finishing unit associated with printing system . Since the configuration of printing system may at any given time be configured to include any number and variety of finishing units controller determines the finisher identifier for each finishing unit presently configured for use with printing system . Controller communicates with enhanced print server to inform the server of the selected document and the identity of all presently configured finishing units . In some embodiments controller may also communicate with print server to transmit a system model identifier of printing system per se.

Based on information received from printing system enhanced print server generates a user interface presentation e.g. a display screen identifying all available printer settings for printing system as presently configured with one or more identified finishing units . In some embodiments the presentation identifying available printer settings may include additional printer settings associated with the system model identifier of printing system per se. The generated user interface presentation is then presented to a user by controller through user interface e.g. displayed on a display circuit of the interface . Controller receives user input through user interface selecting particular printer settings from among the presented available printer settings. Since the server was informed by the printing system of the presently configured finisher units the user interface presentation generated by server presents the user with only those printer settings that may be selected based on the present configuration of the printing system . The selected printer settings are those the user desires to be used in printing the selected document. The selected printer settings are then communicated by controller to print server .

Print server retrieves a copy of the selected document from cloud storage server and modifies the retrieved copy to add suitable commands to effectuate the user s selected printer settings when printing the selected document on the printing system . The modified document including the additional commands is then returned to the printing system from print server and printed under control of controller utilizing print engine and finishing unit . The additional commands may be added to the modified document as job control language JCL commands including for example Printer Job Language PJL commands.

In prior printing environment a print server would require prior knowledge of the specific configuration of each printing system that may ever request a document to be printed. Maintaining such knowledge of the present configuration of each of multiple printing devices is burdensome for the print server and thus inhibits desired flexibility in formatting documents for printing on a particular printing system in its current configuration. By contrast print server of system obtains present configuration information from each printing system coupled with the server when the printing system requests the document to be printed. Thus a selected document may be modified according to selected printer settings unique to the current configuration of any particular printing system . System therefore allows flexibility in printing a selected document in accordance with particular printer settings available on the printing system as presently configured without the print server requiring particular prior knowledge of the present configuration of each of multiple printing systems .

Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize numerous additional and equivalent components in a fully functional system . Such additional and equivalent components are omitted herein for simplicity and brevity of this discussion. Thus is merely intended to suggest one possible embodiment providing the enhanced features and aspects hereof.

At step the printing system transmits the printer and or finisher identifier to a print server coupled with the printing system. In one exemplary embodiment step may also transmit an identifier of the selected document to the print server. At step the printing system receives from the print server a user interface presentation e.g. a display screen indicating all available printer settings. The available printer settings are determined by the print server based on the printer and or finisher identifier information sent to the print server. Thus the available printer settings are customized for the particular printing system as presently configured based on the system model identifier and or finisher identifier transmitted from the printing system to the print server. Step presents the received user interface presentation to a user of the printing system through the user interface of the printing system.

Returning to at step the printing system receives user input through a user interface of the printing system selecting particular printer settings from among the available printer settings presented to the user. The selected printer settings are then transmitted from the printing system to the print server at step . At step the printing system receives from the print server a modified document based on the selected document and the selected printer settings. The modified document is then printed at step to generate the desired output based on the selected document and the selected printer settings.

At step the print server receives a finisher identifier and optionally a printing system model identifier from the printing system indicating the present configuration of the printing system and any finisher units presently configured with the printing system. The printing system model identifier and the finisher identifier may comprise for example a manufacturer identifier and a specific model identifier for the printing system and or for the finisher unit. At step the print server generates a user interface presentation indicating all available printer settings based on the printer and or finisher identifier received from the printing system. Step then transmits the generated user interface presentation to the printing system for display to a user of the printing system. In one exemplary embodiment the user interface presentation may be generated as a web page i.e. encoded as an HTML document for presentation on the printing system via a web browser incorporated within the printing system. Step then receives selected printer settings from the printing system. As noted above a user of the printing system in response to display of available printer settings from the user interface presentation selects desired printer settings and the printing system returns the selected settings to the print server.

At step the print server retrieves a copy of the identified selected document from a cloud storage server coupled with the print server. A copy is retrieved by supplying the document identifier e.g. release code received from the printing system to the cloud storage server. In one exemplary embodiment the cloud storage server and print server may interact utilizing HTTP protocols and HTML encoded exchanges. In other exemplary embodiments the cloud storage server and print server may interact utilizing XML messaging. In general the print server interaction with the cloud storage server is in accordance with the documented protocols and messages defined by the particular cloud storage server third party provider.

At step the print server modifies the retrieved copy of the selected document based on the selected printer settings. The modified copy of the document is then transmitted to the printing system to generate the printed output for the requesting user. As noted above in one exemplary embodiment the modified document content per se may be directly transmitted to the printing system to be printed. In another exemplary embodiment a URL or other suitable locator indicia may be transmitted to the printing system to identify a location of the modified copy of the document such that the printing system may then retrieve the modified document for eventual printing.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize numerous additional and equivalent steps in methods operable in a system such as system of . Such additional and equivalent components are omitted herein for simplicity and brevity of this discussion. Thus are merely intended to suggest possible embodiments of methods providing the enhanced features and aspects hereof.

A lookup table as discussed above may be encoded in the printer server as any suitable data structure that associates 

Table 1 below is exemplary of such a table that may be implemented in any suitable data structure file or database. The entries of Table 1 associate each feature setting name with a corresponding PJL command string to effectuate a corresponding printer setting.

Arrow represents an HTTP GET message directed from the printing system to the print server requesting access to the SaaS cloud printing application. As noted above the cloud printing services enhanced in accordance with features and aspects hereof may be provided as a SaaS application from the print server . Responsive to the HTTP GET arrow represents a return message from the print server to the printing system initiating operation of the cloud printing SaaS application. In one exemplary embodiment the document identification screen discussed above with respect to may be provided in message encoded as an HTML screen to be presented by a web browser operating within printing system .

Responsive to user input provided in the document identifier screen message is directed from the printing system to the print server as an HTTP POST. The POST message may include the release code entered in the document identifier screen as well as one or more finisher identifiers identifying finisher units presently configured with the printing system. In addition as noted above the POST message may include a printing system model identifier identifying the base model of the printing system per se. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the release code e.g. document identifier the finisher identifier and a printing system model identifier if any may all be transmitted in a single HTTP POST message or in multiple such messages.

Responsive to the POST message print server returns message to printing system . Message may include a user interface presentation indicating all available printer settings determined based on the provided one or more finisher identifiers and any provided printing system model identifier received in message . In one exemplary embodiment the available printer settings may be encoded as an HTML web page as depicted and described above with respect to .

At any time after the print server has received the release code e.g. document identifier it may transmit an HTTP GET message to the cloud storage server supplying the release code to identify the requested document. Responsive to this GET message cloud server may return an XML message providing a URL identifying a location in the cloud storage server at which the corresponding document may be retrieved. In many commercially available cloud storage servers documents are stored as PDF portable document format files pointed to by the provided URL. At any time after print server receives message print server may transmit an HTTP GET message to the cloud storage server to retrieve the a copy of the PDF file identified by the URL in message . Message represents return of the requested PDF file from the cloud storage server to the print server . In general messages and exchange information and are encoded in accordance with the requirements of the particular commercial cloud storage server provided by a third party vendor as specified by the cloud storage service within an enterprise intra net.

Message is sent from printing system to print server in response to the user providing input responsive to the user interface presentation of all available printer settings. Message may be an HTTP POST message providing the user s selected printer settings. Responsive to receipt of message print server modifies the PDF file retrieved in message by adding suitable job control commands to the PDF file. The added commands effectuate the users selected printer settings. As noted above processing of the print server generating a modified copy of the document may entail looking up the provided finisher identifier in a lookup table or database to locate corresponding JCL command strings e.g. PJL for inclusion in the modified copy of the document.

Responsive to receipt of message and responsive to completion of the modifications to the copy of the document print server returns message to printing system . Message may include the content of the modified copy of the document. As noted above in alternative embodiments message may merely identify a location of the modified copy of the document within print server e.g. by providing a URL . In these alternative embodiments further message exchanges will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art to request the identified modified copy of the document e.g. another HTTP GET message followed by return of the content of the modified copy of the document from print server to printing system .

Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize numerous additional and equivalent message flows that may be utilized to implement features and aspects hereof. Thus the message exchange of is intended merely as one exemplary embodiment of a sequence of message exchanges in a system such as system of .

Those of ordinary skill in the art will further readily recognize numerous standard programming and interface techniques to obtain information from the printing system regarding its present configuration information such as a printing system model identifier and finisher identifiers for any finisher units presently configured with the printing system. Some controllers of printing systems e.g. controllers of multi function printers are essentially fully functional computing devices that include an object oriented operating system that in turn provides a number of standard object access methods for additional programming features to access printing system information. For example the operating system of the MFP controller may provide a programming interface i.e. an application programming interface or API implementing a Java or JavaScript API. One exemplary API may provide an interface such as described by the following Table 2

Although specific embodiments were described herein the scope of the invention is not limited to those specific embodiments. The scope of the invention is defined by the following claims and any equivalents thereof.
