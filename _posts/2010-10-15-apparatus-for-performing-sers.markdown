Detection and identification or at least classification of unknown substances has long been of great interest and has taken on even greater significance in recent years. Among advanced methodologies that hold a promise for precision detection and identification are various forms of spectroscopy especially those that employ Raman scattering. Spectroscopy may be used to analyze characterize and even identify a substance or material using one or both of an absorption spectrum and an emission spectrum that results when the material is illuminated by a form of electromagnetic radiation for instance visible light . The absorption and emission spectra produced by illuminating the material determine a spectral fingerprint of the material. In general the spectral fingerprint is characteristic of the particular material or its constituent elements facilitating identification of the material. Among the most powerful of optical emission spectroscopy techniques are those based on Raman scattering.

Raman scattering optical spectroscopy employs an emission spectrum or spectral components thereof produced by inelastic scattering of photons by an internal structure of the material being illuminated. These spectral components contained in a response signal for instance a Raman signal may facilitate determination of the material characteristics of an analyte species including identification of the analyte.

Unfortunately the Raman signal produced by Raman scattering is extremely weak in many instances compared to elastic or Rayleigh scattering from an analyte species. The Raman signal level or strength may be significantly enhanced by using a Raman active material for instance Raman active surface however. For instance the Raman scattered light generated by a compound or ion adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10 10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same compound in solution or in the gas phase. This process of analyzing a compound is called surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS . In recent years SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin film systems and even enables single molecule detection. Engineers physicists and chemists continue to seek improvements in systems and methods for performing SERS.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the embodiments are described by referring mainly to examples thereof. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art that the examples may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances well known methods and structures are not described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the description of the examples.

Disclosed herein is an apparatus for performing surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS to detect at least one molecule in an analyte sample with a relatively high level of precision. In one regard the accuracy of the molecule detection is relatively high because the apparatus disclosed herein significantly increases the probability that the at least one molecule will be located near or on a Raman active material layer configured to enhance Raman light emission from the at least one molecule. In another regard the accuracy is increased because the apparatus disclosed herein enables the signal to noise ratio in the processing of the Raman light emissions to be significantly increased.

As discussed in greater detail herein below the apparatus for performing SERS includes a plurality of flexible nano fingers that are configured to collapse under dominant attractive forces between the plurality of flexible nano fingers. In this regard as the nano fingers collapse at least some of the nano fingers are likely to contact each other thereby trapping the molecule s therebetween. In addition the tips or free ends of the nano fingers include Raman active material layers and thus the emission of Raman signals from the molecule s trapped in attached to or otherwise in the vicinities of the tips of the nano fingers is likely to be enhanced.

As further discussed in greater detail herein below active material layers disposed on the free ends of the nano fingers are electrostatically charged to cause the nano fingers to be repelled from each other and thereby create gaps into which the analyte molecules are introducible. The active material layers may comprise the Raman active material layers discussed above or may comprise a separate layer of material from the Raman active material layers. The electrostatic charge applied to the active material layers may be modulated to thereby enable additional analyte molecules to be introduced and to become trapped between adjacent ones of the nano fingers. In this regard the likelihood of identifying the analyte through an analysis of the molecule s may substantially be increased. In addition a Raman scattered light detector may lock in to the frequency at which the positions of the free ends of the nano fingers are modulated to improve the signal to noise ratio of the signals detected from the Raman scattered light emitting from the molecule s . Moreover the frequency of modulation may be tuned to further optimize accurate detection of the Raman scattered light.

Throughout the present disclosure the term n following a reference numeral is intended to denote an integer value that is greater than 1. In addition the terms a and an are intended to denote at least one of a particular element.

The apparatus includes a substrate and a plurality of nano fingers . More particularly the nano fingers are depicted as being attached to and extending above a surface of the substrate . The nano fingers may be integrally formed with the substrate or may be separately formed from the substrate . Thus the nano fingers may be formed of the same material or materials as the substrate or may be formed of one or more different materials from the substrate .

A nano finger may be defined as an elongated nanoscale structure having a length or height that exceeds by more than several times a nanoscale cross sectional dimension for instance width taken in a plane perpendicular to the length for instance length 3 width . In general the length is much greater than the width or cross sectional dimension to facilitate collapsing of the nano finger laterally onto one or more neighboring nano fingers . In some embodiments the length exceeds the cross sectional dimension or width by more than a factor of about 5 or 10. For example the width may be about 100 nanometers nm and the height may be about 500 nm. In another example the width at the base of the nano finger may range between about 20 nm and about 300 nm and the length may be more than about 1 micrometer m . In other examples the nano finger is sized based upon the types of materials used to form the nano finger . Thus for instance the more rigid the material s used to form the nano finger the less the width of the nano finger may be to enable the nano finger to be laterally collapsible.

The nano fingers may be formed of a polymer material such as polydimethylsiloxane PDMS elastomer polyimide polyethylene polypropelene etc. to thus cause the nano fingers to be relatively flexible and thus to be laterally collapsible. In various examples the nano fingers may be fabricated through a nanoimprinting process in which a template of relatively rigid pillars is employed in a multi step imprinting process on a polymer matrix to form the nano fingers . Various other processes such as etching and various techniques used in the fabrication of micro electromechanical systems MEMS and nano electromechanical systems NEMS may also be used to fabricate the nano fingers .

As shown in the nano fingers are arranged in an array on the substrate . In addition the nano fingers may be randomly distributed or the nano fingers may be arranged in a predetermined configuration to therefore cause the nano scale protrusions to be distributed in a substantially uniform density on the substrate . In any regard and as discussed in greater detail herein below the nano fingers are arranged with respect to each other such that the free ends of at least two neighboring nano fingers are able to touch each other when the nano fingers are in a collapsed state. By way of particular example the neighboring nano fingers are positioned less than about 100 nanometers apart from each other.

The nano fingers have been depicted in as having substantially cylindrical cross sections. It should however be understood that the nano fingers may have other shaped cross sections such as for instance rectangular square triangular etc. In addition or alternatively the nano fingers may be formed with one or more features such as notches bulges etc. to substantially cause the nano fingers to be inclined to collapse in a particular direction. Thus for instance two or more adjacent nano fingers may include the one or more features to increase the likelihood of these nano fingers to collapse toward each other.

The substrate provides a support on which the distances between the first ends or bases of the nano fingers may substantially be maintained. According to an example the substrate is composed of an insulating material or a dielectric material including a polymer glass SiO AlO or any other suitable material upon which the nano fingers may be supported. According to another example the substrate is composed of an electrically conductive material and may operate as an electrically conductive source to the nano fingers as discussed herein below.

Turning now to there is shown a cross sectional view along a line A A shown in of the apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In addition an end of a nano finger is magnified in an enlargement which reveals that the nano finger includes an active material layer disposed on the outer surface near the tip or free end of the nano finger . Generally speaking the active material layer comprises a material configured to be electrostatically charged such as a metal. According to one or more examples the active material layer comprises a SERS active material such as the SERS active nano particles depicted in . According to other examples the active material layer comprises a separate layer for instance positioned underneath the nano particles depicted in . In these examples the active material layer may be fabricated as part of and integrated with the nano finger .

Each of the other nano fingers includes the active material layer SERS active nano particles as represented by the circles on the tops or free ends of the nano fingers . Although the enlargement depicts the nano particles as covering the entire tip of the nano finger it should be understood that examples of the apparatus may be implemented with gaps between some of the nano particles .

It should also be noted that examples of the apparatus are not limited to nano particles disposed over just the tips of the nano scale protrusions . In other examples the nano particles may be disposed over part of or nearly the entire surface of the nano fingers . In any regard the SERs active nano particles may be deposited onto at least the free ends of the nano fingers through for instance physical vapor deposition PVD chemical vapor deposition CVD sputtering etc. of metallic material or self assembly of pre synthesized nano particles. By way of example the angle at which the nano particles are deposited onto the free second ends of the nano fingers may be controlled to thereby substantially control the deposition of the nano particles .

In addition the active material layer nano particles may be configured to one or both of enhance Raman scattering and facilitate analyte adsorption. For instance the active material layer nano particles may comprise a Raman active material such as but not limited to gold Au silver Ag and copper Cu having nanoscale surface roughness. Nanoscale surface roughness is generally characterized by nanoscale surface features on the surface of the layer s and may be produced spontaneously during deposition of the Raman active material layer s . By definition herein a Raman active material is a material that facilitates Raman scattering and the production or emission of the Raman signal from an analyte adsorbed on or in a surface layer or the material during Raman spectroscopy.

In some examples the active material layer nano particles may be annealed or otherwise treated to increase nanoscale surface roughness of the active material layer nano particles after deposition. Increasing the surface roughness may enhance Raman scattering from an adsorbed analyte for example. Alternatively the arrangement of the nano particles may provide a nanoscale roughness that enhances Raman scattering for example.

In some embodiments a surface of the nano fingers may be functionalized to facilitate adsorption of the analyte. For example the tips or free ends of the nano fingers in a vicinity thereof not illustrated may be functionalized with a binding group to facilitate binding with a specific target analyte species. A surface of the active material layer nano particles may be functionalized for example. The functionalized surface that is either a surface of the nano finger itself the active material layer nano particles or both may provide a surface to which a particular class of analytes is attracted and may bond or be preferentially adsorbed. The functionalized surface may selectively bond with protein DNA or RNA for example.

Also shown in are a voltage source and an electrically conductive source which is depicted as being connected to a ground. The voltage source may comprise any suitable source from which alternating current AC or direct current DC voltage may be received. The electrically conductive source may comprise any suitable component through the AC or DC voltage may be applied in relatively close proximity to the nano fingers . Thus for instance the electrically conductive source may comprise an electrode or wire positioned in relatively close proximity without contacting the nano fingers .

Alternatively the substrate itself may comprise the electrically conductive source as depicted in . In the embodiment depicted in the nano fingers are formed of at least a semi insulating material to thereby substantially limit or prevent conduction of electrical charge from the substrate to the active material layers nano particles through the nano fingers .

In the voltage source is depicted as being activated or in an on state and is thus depicted as applying a voltage through the electrically conductive source or the substrate . The application of the voltage through the electrically conductive source is depicted as generating an electrostatic charge onto the active material layer nano particles thereby causing the active material layer nano particles to become electrostatically charged with the same polarity. The nano active material layer nano particles disposed on the ends of adjacent nano fingers thus repel each other.

Although the nano fingers have been depicted in as each extending vertically and at the same heights with respect to each other it should be understood that some or all of the nano fingers may extend at various angles and heights with respect to each other. The differences in angles and or heights between the nano fingers may be based upon for instance differing levels of influence the neighboring active material layer nano particles apply on the active material layer nano particles of the nano fingers differences arising from the fabrication of the nano fingers and the deposition of the nano particles on the nano fingers etc.

However when the voltage source is deactivated as indicated by the X in the nano fingers are configured to be in a substantially collapsed state. The substantially collapsed state is one in which the active material layer nano particles of adjacent nano fingers are configured to be drawn together through static force similar to the manner in which thin layers of gold leaf are drawn together when brought in relatively close proximity to each other. In addition or alternatively the substantially collapsed state is one in which the nano fingers collapse by virtue of gravitational force acting on the nano fingers .

Although the nano fingers have been depicted in as collapsing at respective first ends attached to the substrate it should be understood that the nano fingers may collapse along other locations throughout the body portions of the nano fingers . Thus for instance one or more of the nano fingers may be in the collapsed state by bending at around a central position of the body portions such as occurs with a relatively thin wire or human hair. The locations at which the nano fingers bend and therefore collapse may substantially be random and due to the properties of the materials used to form the nano fingers as well as the materials and amounts of the active material layer nano particles deposited on the nano fingers . In addition or alternatively the nano fingers may employ one or more features designed to promote the collapsing of the nano fingers when the active material layer nano particles are not electrostatically charged with the same polarity. The one or more features may include for instance inclusion of additional material or active material layer nano particles on one side of a nano finger to make the weight distribution of the nano finger uneven the formation of a notch or other feature on one side of the nano finger to promote collapsing of the nano finger toward that side etc. According to an example the one and more features may be employed on the nano fingers to promote the collapsing of a plurality of adjacent nano fingers toward each other.

An example of an enlarged top view of part of the apparatus depicted in in which the nano fingers are in the collapsed state is depicted in . As shown in the nano fingers may collapse in any of a number of different directions. More particularly two of the nano fingers in the upper left portion of are depicted as having collapsed toward each other while the bottom two nano fingers are depicted as having collapsed away from other nano fingers . In addition three of the nano fingers on the right portion of are depicted as having collapsed toward each other. It should be clearly understood that adjacent nano fingers may have collapsed in any other possible arrangement. It should also be clearly understood that the nano fingers may be configured to collapse in random or predefined directions following activation and deactivation of the voltage source as discussed above with respect to .

Also shown in are a plurality of analyte molecules that may be introduced onto the apparatus in a fluid or a gas. In addition some of the analyte molecules are depicted as being captured between the nano particles of adjacent nano fingers that have collapsed upon each other while others of the analyte molecules have been depicted as being unattached to any of the nano particles . Other ones of the analyte molecules have been depicted as being attached to the nano particles . As such some of the analyte molecules may be adsorbed by the nano particles .

The active material layer nano particles may be electrostatically charged to cause adjacent ones of the nano fingers to be repelled from each other and thereby create sufficiently sized gaps therebetween to enable the analyte molecules to be introduced into the gaps. In addition the electrostatic charge on the active material layer nano particles may be removed to thereby cause at least some of the nano fingers to collapse on each other as shown in and thereby trap the analyte molecules between the adjacent nano fingers that have collapsed upon each other. The trapping of the analyte molecules between the adjacent nano fingers may enhance a signal strength of a Raman signal produced by Raman scattering from the analyte molecules due to their close proximity to the nano particles . The trapping of the analyte molecules also increases the likelihood that Raman light scattering from the analyte molecules will be enhanced by the nano particles .

With reference now to there is shown a block diagram of a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS system according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the system depicted in may include additional components and that some of the components described herein may be removed and or modified without departing from a scope of the system . It should also be understood that the components depicted in are not drawn to scale and thus the components may have different relative sizes with respect to each other than as shown therein.

As shown in the SERS system includes the apparatus depicted in and A B an illumination source and a detector . The voltage source and the electrically conductive source are also depicted in . The apparatus is also depicted as including the active material layer nano particles disposed on the nano fingers which is attached to the substrate . As discussed above according to an example the substrate may comprise the electrically conductive source and thus the electrically conductive source may be omitted from the system and the voltage source may be configured to apply a voltage through the substrate .

The SERS system is depicted with the voltage source in a deactivated state and thus the active material layer nano particles are not electrostatically charged. As such the nano fingers are depicted as being in a collapsed state in and thus one or more analyte molecules may be trapped between two or more of the contacting nano fingers .

The illumination source is configured to emit an electromagnetic radiation such as visible light onto the free ends of the nano fingers as represented by the arrow . By way of example the illumination source may comprise a laser that illuminates the free ends of the nano fingers with visible light. The electromagnetic radiation is intended to cause the analyte molecules to produce Raman scattered light as represented by the arrow . In addition the detector is positioned and configured to detect the Raman scattered light emitting from the analyte molecule s .

As discussed above the nano particles located near or adjacent to the analyte molecule s may enhance the production of Raman scattered light from the analyte molecule s by concentrating or otherwise enhancing an electromagnetic field in a vicinity of the analyte molecule s . As also discussed above the collapsing of two or more of the nano fingers upon each other to trap the analyte molecule s may substantially increase the likelihood that the analyte molecule s will be positioned near or in contact with some nano particles . In this regard the likelihood that an analyte molecule s will produce relatively strong Raman scattered light will thus also be increased. Thus through implementation of the system the detector may receive a relatively stronger Raman scattered light signal from the illuminated analyte molecule s as compared with conventional SERS systems.

The detector is configured to convert the Raman scattered light emitted from the analyte molecule s into electrical signals that may be processed to identify for instance the analyte. In some examples the detector is configured to output the electrical signals to other components not shown configured to process the electrical signals. In other examples the detector is equipped with processing capabilities to identify the analyte.

According to one or more examples the voltage source is configured to modulate application of voltage through the electrically conductive source or the substrate at a defined frequency. In this regard the voltage source is configured modulate the electrostatic charging of the nano particles to thereby cause the nano fingers to alternately be in the collapsed state when the active material layer nano particles are not electrostatically charged and in a repelled state with respect to each other when the active material layer nano particles are electrostatically charged. In these examples the detector may be programmed with or be able to identify the defined frequency at which the voltage source modulates application of the voltage.

In addition the detector or a post signal processing apparatus not shown located downstream of the detector may implement a lock in detection technique on the detected Raman light emission at the identified frequency. As such for instance the detector or post signal processing apparatus includes a lock in amplifier a boxcar amplifier or the like which serves to detect and amplify only the signal component of the electrical signal from the detector that has the same frequency as that of the identified frequency at which the voltage source modulates the application of voltage through the electrically conductive source . Because the detector or the post signal processing apparatus detects and amplifies only the signal component of the electrical signal that has the same frequency as that of the identified frequency of a reference signal received from the voltage source the input signal component having a frequency different from that of the reference signal is not sampled. Further by selecting appropriately the locked in phase the detector or the post signal processing apparatus may sample the signal component ascribable to a particular analyte molecule .

Through implementation of the lock in detection technique discussed above the signal to noise ratio in the processing of the Raman light emissions may be significantly increased over conventional Raman light emission detection techniques. As such the accuracy of the molecule detection may also be significantly increased over conventional Raman light emission detection techniques.

Turning now to there is shown a flow diagram of a method for performing surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS to detect at least one analyte molecule on an apparatus according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the method depicted in may include additional steps and that some of the steps described herein may be removed and or modified without departing from a scope of the method .

At block the voltage source is activated to apply a voltage through the electrically conductive source and cause the active material layer nano particles to become electrostatically charged with the same polarity. The electrostatically charged nano particles are thus configured to obtain the same charge and repel each other as discussed above with respect to . In addition gaps are created between adjacent ones of the nano fingers into which the analyte molecules may be introduced. According to an example the nano fingers are arranged at a range of distances with respect to each other in which the electrostatic charge on the active material layer nano particles of adjacent nano fingers is sufficiently strong to cause the active material layer nano particles to be repelled from each other a sufficient distance to enable at least one molecule of the analyte to enter between the active material layer nano particles on the adjacent nano fingers and to be sufficiently close to each other to enable the active material layer nano particles on adjacent nano fingers to contact each other when the nano fingers are in the collapsed state.

In one example the analyte is introduced onto the nano fingers prior to initiation of the method . In another example the analyte is introduced onto the nano fingers for instance through introduction through a micro fluidic channel not shown following initiation of the method and more particularly following step .

At block the voltage source is deactivated to remove the electrostatic charge of the same polarity on the active material layer nano particles and therefore enable the nano fingers to collapse as the active material layer nano particles no longer repel each other. As the nano fingers collapse at least some of the nano fingers are likely to collapse on each other such that the active material layer nano particles on one nano finger contacts the active material layer nano particles on an adjacent nano finger . The contacting of the second ends of the nano fingers may occur because the apparatus may include a relatively large number of closely arranged nano fingers and based upon a random collapsing of the nano fingers at least two of the second ends are highly likely to contact each other when the nano fingers are in the collapsed state. Alternatively however and as discussed above at least some of the nano fingers may be provided with one or more features designed to cause the nano fingers to collapse toward each other thereby increasing the likelihood and the number of nano fingers coming into contact with each other when the nano fingers are in the collapsed state.

At block the illuminating source is activated to illuminate the second ends of the nano fingers . As discussed above the nano particles are configured to enhance the production of Raman scattered light emitted from the analyte molecules . The probability that the Raman scattered light production from the analyte molecules will be enhanced is generally increased for those analyte molecule s that are trapped between the second ends of one or more adjacent nano fingers .

At block the detector detects the Raman scattered light if any produced from the analyte molecule s . As discussed above the detected Raman scattered light may be processed to identify the analyte.

According to an example the method may end following detection of the Raman scattered light at block . According to another example however blocks of the method may be performed over a number of cycles to further enhance the likelihood of detecting sufficiently strong signals to accurately identify the analyte. In addition as discussed above with respect to the detector in the voltage source may be modulated between activation at block and deactivation at block at a defined frequency. Moreover the detector or a processor configured to receive and process electrical signals from the detector is configured to lock into the defined frequency at which the voltage source is activated and deactivated to substantially enhance the signal to noise ratio of the electrical signals converted from the Raman light emission detected by the detector . More particularly for instance the detector may be configured to determine the moment that the second ends of the nano fingers collapse on each other from the defined frequency to detect the Raman light emission or to process the electrical signal converted from the Raman light emission at that moment since that is when the Raman signal emitted from the analyte molecule s is likely to be the greatest. In this regard the sensitivity of the detector to the Raman light emission may substantially be increased.

According to one or more examples the frequency at which the voltage source is modulated may be tuned to obtain the optimal or nearly optimal SERS performance. Thus for instance the frequency at which the voltage source is modulated may be decreased to provide additional time for the analyte molecules to be introduced between adjacent nano fingers . Alternatively the frequency may be increased to enable a greater number of signal detections to be obtained over a period of time.

Turning now to there is shown a schematic representation of a computing device configured to implement or execute the method in accordance with examples of the invention. The computing device may comprise for instance a desktop computer laptop server etc. The computing device includes one or more processors such as a central processing unit one or more display devices such as a monitor an illumination source interface I F a detector interface a voltage source interface one or more network interfaces such as a Local Area Network LAN a wireless 802.11x LAN a 3G mobile WAN or a WiMax WAN and one or more computer readable mediums . Each of these components is operatively coupled to one or more buses . For example the bus may be an EISA a PCI a USB a FireWire a NuBus or a PDS.

The computer readable medium may be any suitable medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. For example the computer readable medium may be non volatile media such as an optical or a magnetic disk volatile media such as memory and transmission media such as coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic light or radio frequency waves.

The computer readable medium may also store an operating system such as Mac OS MS Windows Unix or Linux network applications and a molecule detection application . The operating system may be multi user multiprocessing multitasking multithreading real time and the like. The operating system may also perform basic tasks such as recognizing input from input devices such as a keyboard or a keypad sending output to the display the illuminating source the detector and the voltage source keeping track of files and directories on medium controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives printers image capture device and managing traffic on the one or more buses . The network applications include various components for establishing and maintaining network connections such as software for implementing communication protocols including TCP IP HTTP Ethernet USB and FireWire.

The molecule detection application provides various software components for detecting molecules as described above. In certain examples some or all of the processes performed by the molecule detection application may be integrated into the operating system . In certain embodiments the processes can be at least partially implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in any combination thereof.
