title: Hydroreactive energetic device and method
abstract: An explosive event may be produced by mixing reactive material and water to form a mixture. The reactive material may be mixed with a substantially stoichiometric amount of water needed for complete reaction of the water with the reactive material. After forming the mixture, the mixture may be detonated with opposing shock waves. Shock fronts of the opposing shock waves may coincide to form a mach front or mach stem, which may enhance the explosive effect.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

Combining reactive materials RM with water may produce shock energy and bubble energy. The chemical energy of an underwater explosion may be distributed into shock and bubble performance as well as waste energy. The shock and the bubble produced by an underwater explosion may each contribute to the performance of the explosive event. A shock wave may initiate the decomposition of a high energy explosive causing a release of gases and energy. The release of gases and energy may initiate the chemical decomposition of an oxidizer into a gas that drives the early expansion of a bubble.

Subsequently the energy released from the fuel reacting with the product gases may be generally slow and may contribute to the bubble performance. If the expanding mixture is heavy in solids the conversion of the chemical energy to potential energy of the bubble may be inefficient and may lead to waste energy in the form of hot gases at the end of the bubble expansion. If the expanding mixture is mostly gases then the peak pressure may be high but the shock wave may only be supported for a short time and the energy from gas producing reactions may be generally less than the energy from fuel oxidizer reactions.

The conversion of chemical energy to potential energy of a bubble may be generally very efficient leaving no waste energy in the form of hot gases at the end of the bubble expansion. Thus increasing the energy release from intimate fuel oxidizer RM H2O combinations early in the bubble expansion process may increase the rate of oxidizer decomposition and therefore the shock performance. The rapid early time frame bubble expansion may generate a shock wave out into the water. The shock wave may very quickly outpace the expanding bubble. Enhanced shock performance may result from increasing the early time frame rate of bubble expansion and sustaining the rate of bubble expansion as long as possible.

An aspect of the invention is a method that may include mixing reactive material and water to form a mixture and after forming the mixture detonating the mixture with opposing shock waves. The reactive material may be mixed with a substantially stoichiometric amount of the water needed for complete reaction of the water with the reactive material. After detonating the coincidence of opposing shock fronts of the opposing shock waves may form a mach front.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus that may include a closed container with explosive material disposed at opposite ends of the closed container. A second container containing reactive material may be disposed in the closed container. The closed container may include a valve for connecting to an ambient water supply. The second container may include an opener for opening the second container. A control unit may be connected to the valve the opener and the explosive material.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A reactive material RM is an energetic material having two or more solid state reactants that together form a thermo chemical mixture. RM may include for example mixtures of metals with metals and mixtures of metals with metal oxides. The mixtures may or may not include binders. Some examples of RM are ultra fine powders such as nano aluminum and self propagating high temperature synthesis SHS materials such as thermites intermetallics nano metals micro size metals etc. RM may be pre mixed with water prior to detonation to realize shock energy bubble energy and impulse.

Prior to detonation RM and water may be mixed to form a mixture. In some embodiments the mixture may contain the stoichiometric amount of water needed for complete reaction of the water with the RM. Some embodiments may include a mixture where the RM has a density that is greater than about 2.0 grams per cubic centimeter or greater than about 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter.

After mixing the mixture may then be detonated. Detonation of the mixture may occur soon after mixing. In some embodiments the mixture may be detonated within about ten minutes of mixing within about five minutes of mixing or within about a minute of mixing.

Two opposing explosives may be used to detonate the mixture. The two opposing explosives may each produce opposing shock waves. The two shock waves may propagate through the mixture of RM and water thereby detonating the mixture. The two opposing shock fronts may coincide or fuse near the middle of the mixture forming a mach stem or mach front. Formation of the mach front may increase the temperature pressure and turbulent mixing of the mixture.

Physically confining the reaction may cause the two opposing shock waves to be reflected inwardly thereby increasing the energy released. Therefore a closed container may contain the mixture prior to detonation. The water needed for the mixture may be introduced into the closed container from the ambient environment. For example if the container is in a body of water such as an ocean river lake etc then water from the body of water surrounding the container may be used in the mixture. In this way it may not be necessary to transport the water oxidizer with the RM.

Detonation of the explosives may produce opposing shock waves . Shock waves may propagate from the ends of container and through mixture thereby detonating mixture . The shock fronts of the shock waves may coincide near the middle of container to form a mach front or mach stem. The mach front or mach stem may increase the explosive output of the mixture .

A valve in container may lead directly to the outside of torpedo or may as shown in be connected to tubing or piping that may lead to the outside of torpedo . A water pump may be used to introduce water from outside the torpedo into container via piping and valve . The amount of water introduced into the container may be the stoichiometric amount of water needed for complete reaction of the water with the RM .

The RM container may be rupturable by an opener . Opener may be for example a small quantity of energetic material. An agitator may be disposed in container for mixing the RM and water. A control unit may be connected to the valve the opener and the detonators . The control unit may include a processor and power supply. The control unit may also be connected to the pump and agitator .

When the torpedo nears its target valve may open and introduce water into container . Or the pump may be used to pump water into container . The opener may be activated to open container so that the RM may mix with the water. The agitator may be activated to insure thorough mixing of the RM and water. Just prior to impact of the torpedo with its target explosive material located at opposite ends of container may be initiated by detonators . Initiation of the explosive material may produce opposing shock waves that emanate from the opposite ends of container . The reaction then proceeds as previously described.

If explosive material is chosen to be compliant with Insensitive Materials IM requirements then the overall hydroreactive energetic apparatus may be compliant with IM requirements and may yield a more powerful energetic material configuration than conventional arrangements. The hydroreactive energetic apparatus may not require the use of ammonium perchlorate or explosive components such as PBXN 103 and PBXN 111. Apparatus that utilize ammonium perchlorate may in some cases not comply with IM or environmental requirements.

The disclosed method may mix RM with water quickly enough to produce shock impulse. Because the RM and water is mixed prior to detonation the problems of quenching of the shock heated particles by the water and a reaction time that is too long to realize shock impulse may be avoided.

Any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
