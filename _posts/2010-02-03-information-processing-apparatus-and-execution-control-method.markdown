The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus and an execution control method.

An information processing apparatus such as a PC Personal Computer and mobile phone can execute application software other than application software embedded during manufacture by for example the application software being installed.

In the meantime technology concerning control of application software execution has been developed. Technology to control execution of application software installation based on an authentication result in an external apparatus include for example Patent Document 1.

In recent years with increasingly faster communication and widespread use of networks such as the Internet it has become possible for an information processing apparatus to acquire application software hereinafter may also be called an application from an external apparatus via a network to execute the application software. With the operation described above the information processing apparatus can for example execute an application other than applications stored in the external apparatus and embedded during manufacture so that multi functionality of the information processing apparatus can easily be realized.

When the information processing apparatus acquires an application for example from an external apparatus via a network safety when the acquired application is executed needs to be enhanced. Safety when an application is executed indicates for example that no problem arises when the application is executed and safety is enhanced by further reducing the possibility that a problem arises. Problems that could arise when an application is executed include for example an occurrence of some malfunction in the information processing apparatus by an application being executed unauthorized access by a malicious third party being carried out and leakage of personal information.

Thus when an application is delivered via a network for example an application for which no occurrence of problem when executed has been verified in advance by the manufacturer of the information processing apparatus or an organization authorized by the manufacturer is delivered. However applications that can be acquired by the information processing apparatus from an external apparatus via a network are not limited to applications whose safety has been verified in advance for example applications released by individuals.

When an application for which no occurrence of problem has not been verified in advance is acquired for example the information processing apparatus notifies the user that safety thereof has not been verified and the application is executed based on a user s operation. In the above case however if the notified user does not know whether safety of an application is ensured before a user s operation to permit execution thereof being performed there is the possibility that a problem concerning safety arises after execution of the application being permitted. Moreover even if the user knows that safety of an application is ensured when the user permits execution thereof a problem concerning safety may arise after execution of the application being permitted if a problem concerning safety exists unidentified when execution of the application is permitted.

An information processing apparatus to which conventional technology concerning control of application software execution hereinafter called a conventional information processing apparatus is applied detects the start of installation of an application. The conventional information processing apparatus also checks with an external server to see whether installation of the application is permitted for the information processing apparatus and if permitted installs the application. Then the conventional information processing apparatus suitably executes the installed application based on a user s operation or automatically. That is according to conventional technology execution of an application is controlled by an external server during installation of the application. Thus by using conventional technology installation of an application whose problem with safety has been identified is prevented and thus a conventional information processing apparatus may be able to improve safety concerning execution of an application to some extent.

However according to conventional technology execution of an application is controlled only during installation of the application. Thus for example if some problem concerning safety of an application is detected after installation of the application is permitted a conventional information processing apparatus will optionally execute the application having a problem concerning safety.

Moreover applications acquired by an information processing apparatus from an external apparatus via a network are not limited to those applications that are installed after the acquisition and executed after the installation. For example the information processing apparatus can execute like an application called a widget an application that is appropriately acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution is started by acquiring the application from the external apparatus.

However conventional technology only controls execution of an application during installation of the application and thus it is difficult for the conventional technology to control execution of an application like a widget that is executed without being installed.

Therefore even if the conventional technology is used there is no way to improve safety concerning execution of an application.

The present invention is made in view of the above mentioned issue and aims to provide a novel and improved information processing apparatus capable of improving safety in execution of application software acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution of the application software is started and an execution control method.

According to the first aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above mentioned object there is provided an information processing apparatus including a communication unit capable of communicating with an external apparatus an acquisition unit that acquires application software from an external storage apparatus storing the application software via the communication unit each time processing concerning execution of the application software is started a registration determination unit that determines whether the external storage apparatus which is an acquisition source of the acquired application software is a pre registered external storage apparatus a first execution determination unit that determines whether to execute the acquired application software based on a user s operation if the registration determination unit determines that the external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source is not registered a communication processing unit that performs communication concerning authentication to execute the application software with an authentication server via the communication unit if the first execution determination unit determines to execute the application software a second execution determination unit that determines whether to execute the application software based on an authentication result transmitted from the authentication server and an execution processing unit that selectively executes the acquired application software if the registration determination unit determines that the external storage apparatus is registered or the second execution determination unit determines to execute the application software.

According to such configuration safety in execution of application software acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution of the application software is started can be improved.

Further if the registration determination unit determines that the external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source is not registered the registration determination unit determines whether the acquired application software is registered application software and if the registration determination unit determines that the application software is registered the first execution determination unit does not determine whether to execute the application software and the communication processing unit may perform communication concerning the authentication with the authentication server.

Further the information processing apparatus may further include a storage unit that stores registered external storage apparatus information in which information to identify the external storage apparatus is stored and the registration determination unit may determine whether the external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source is registered based on the registered external storage apparatus information and the information to identify the external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source contained in the acquired application software.

Further the communication processing unit may perform communication with the external storage apparatus recorded in the registered external storage apparatus information via the communication unit based on the registered external storage apparatus information stored in the storage unit and perform communication with the authentication server based on authentication server information in which information to identify the authentication server acquired from the external storage apparatus recorded in the registered external storage apparatus information is recorded.

Further if the authentication server information is stored in the storage unit the communication processing unit may perform communication with the authentication server based on the authentication server information stored in the storage unit.

Further the information processing apparatus may further include a storage unit that stores registered application information indicating registered application software and the registration determination unit may determine whether the acquired application software is registered based on the registered application information stored in the storage unit.

Further if neither the first execution determination unit nor the second execution determination unit determines to execute the application software the execution processing unit may not execute the acquired application software.

Further the information processing apparatus may further include a report information transmission processing unit that performs processing to cause transmission of report information indicating a problem concerning safety of the executed application software to the authentication server.

According to the second aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above mentioned object there is provided an execution control method including the steps of acquiring application software from an external storage apparatus storing the application software each time processing concerning execution of the application software is started determining whether the external storage apparatus which is an acquisition source of the acquired application software acquired in the acquisition step is a pre registered external storage apparatus determining whether to execute the acquired application software based on a user s operation if it is determined in the registration determination step that the external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source is not registered performing communication concerning authentication to execute the application software with an authentication server if the determination to execute the application software is made in the first execution determination step determining whether to execute the application software based on an authentication result transmitted from the authentication server and executing the acquired application software selectively if the determination is made in the registration determination step that the external storage apparatus is registered or the determination to execute the application software is made in the second execution determination step.

By using the above method safety in execution of application software acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution of the application software is started can be improved.

According to the present invention safety in execution of application software acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution of the application software is started can be improved.

Hereinafter preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Note that in this specification and the drawings elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference signs and repeated explanation is omitted.

Before the configuration of an information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention is described a safety improvement approach according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.

The network includes for example a wire network such as a LAN Local Area Network and WAN Wide Area Network a wireless network such as a wireless WAN WWAN Wireless Wide Area Network via a base station and wireless MAN WMAN Wireless Metropolitan Area Network and the Internet using a communication protocol such as TCP IP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol .

 Connection according to an embodiment of the present invention refers to for example being in a state in which communication can be performed between apparatuses or a state in which communication can be performed between apparatuses . That is for example it becomes possible for the information processing apparatus to acquire for example download an application stored in the external server A after the information processing apparatus and the external server A being connected. Further for example the information processing apparatus can perform communication concerning authentication to execute an application described later with the authentication server after the information processing apparatus and authentication server being connected.

Though not shown in the information processing system according to an embodiment of the present invention may has a plurality of information processing apparatuses and or a plurality of authentication servers . A display apparatus is shown as the information processing apparatus in but the information processing apparatus is not limited to the display apparatus shown in . That is is a diagram exemplifying the information processing system according to an embodiment of the present invention and an application example and appearance of the information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention are not limited to those of . Similarly application examples and appearances of the authentication server and the external servers A and B are not limited to those of .

The information processing apparatus acquires an application stored in an external apparatus such as the external servers A B . . . each time the information processing apparatus executes the application. Then the information processing apparatus selectively executes the application acquired from the external apparatus by performing processing concerning a safety improvement approach according to an embodiment of the present invention described later. More specifically the information processing apparatus performs for example processing as described below.

The authentication server performs communication concerning authentication to execute an application with the information processing apparatus . Communication concerning authentication to execute an application according to an embodiment of the present invention is a sequence of communication and communication processing in which the information processing apparatus transmits a safety information transmission request and the authentication server transmits safety information to the information processing apparatus . Safety information is for example information about whether execution of an application is permitted by the authentication server and corresponds to an authentication result of the authentication server .

The authentication server also stores a database in which information about safety of applications is recorded in a server side storage unit not shown . In the authentication server the database is used as a black list in which applications whose problem with safety is identified are registered or as a white list in which applications whose safety is verified are registered . By using the database the authentication server can determine whether an application to be authenticated is a safe application in communication concerning authentication to execute the application described later .

The authentication server generates safety information of content in accordance with a result of the determination based on reception of a safety information transmission request and transmits the generated safety information to the information processing apparatus . That is safety information authentication result can be considered to indicate whether a problem arises when an application is executed.

Information of applications whose problem with safety has been identified or information of applications whose safety has been verified is recorded in the database in advance but information recorded in the database is not limited to the above example. For example information of a new application can be added to the database or information of a recorded application can be updated or deleted.

The information of the application includes for example an ID that uniquely identifies the application and registered external storage apparatus information in which information to identify an external server external storage apparatus storing the application is recorded. The registered external storage apparatus information includes for example a URL Uniform Resource Identifier and IP Internet Protocol address. An example in which the information processing apparatus or the authentication server constituting the information processing system uniquely identifies the external server external storage apparatus storing an application by using the URI as the registered external storage apparatus information will mainly be described below.

An addition update or deletion operation on information in the database is performed based on for example an operation of an administrator of the authentication server but an addition update or deletion operation on information in the database is not necessarily performed based on an operation of the administrator. For example the authentication server may receive report information described later transmitted by each of the information processing apparatuses not shown in constituting the information processing system to perform an addition update or deletion operation on information in the database based on the received report information. The authentication server realizes addition of information to the database by for example recording an application for which a predetermined number of pieces of report information that the application has a safety problem have been collected as an application having a safety problem in the database. Moreover the authentication server can similarly perform an update or deletion operation on information in the database based on for example collected report information.

The authentication server may adopt the same hardware configuration described later as that of the information processing apparatus .

The external server stores applications executable by the information processing apparatus . Then the external server transmits a stored application to the information processing apparatus in response to an acquisition request from each of the information processing apparatuses constituting the information processing system .

The external server constituting the information processing system is not limited to for example storage of applications whose safety has been verified by the manufacturer of the information processing apparatuses or an organization accredited by the manufacturer. For example the external server may also store applications whose safety has not been verified by the manufacturer of the information processing apparatuses or the like such as an application created by an individual.

An case in which the external server A shown in is an external server storing applications whose safety has been verified by the manufacture or the like and the external server B is an external server storing applications whose safety has not been verified by the manufacture or the like is taken as an example for the description below.

The external servers A B . . . may adopt the same hardware configuration described later as that of the information processing apparatus .

The information processing system has for example as shown in the information processing apparatus the authentication server and the external apparatus . It is needless to say that the configuration of the information processing system according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to that shown in .

Next processing concerning the safety improvement approach in the information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.

The information processing apparatus acquires an application from the external server appropriately each time the information processing apparatus starts execution processing for execution of the application stored in the external server . When an application is acquired the information processing apparatus performs registration determination processing based on an acquisition source of the application first execution determination processing based on a user s operation and second execution determination processing based on a communication result with the authentication server . Then if a determination result that safety of the application has been verified is obtained the information processing apparatus selectively executes the acquired application.

Thus the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of application software acquired from an external apparatus for execution each time execution of the application software is started. If for example the acquired application is a pre registered application the information processing apparatus may selectively execute the acquired application without performing the first execution determination processing.

More specifically the information processing apparatus improves safety in execution of application software executed by being acquired from an external apparatus by for example performing processing of 1 to processing of 5 shown below. The information processing apparatus further performs processing of 6 to further improve safety by selectively transmitting report information described later to the authentication server .

The information processing apparatus acquires for example downloads an application whose execution is desired and stored in the external server each time execution of the application is started. The information processing apparatus acquires an application by transmitting a corresponding acquisition request of the application to the external server based on a user s operation in a browser or a predetermined application acquisition screen but the acquisition method of an application is not limited to the above method.

A user of the information processing apparatus performs a user s desired operation by for example using an operation unit described later provided with the information processing apparatus but the target on which the user performs the user s operation is not limited to the above example. For example the user may operate an external operation apparatus such as a remote controller so that the information processing apparatus can perform processing based on a user s operation based on an external operation signal corresponding to the received user s operation on the external operation apparatus transmitted from the external operation apparatus.

After the application to be executed being acquired by the processing of 1 the information processing apparatus determines whether the external server which is an acquisition source of the application is a pre registered external server external storage apparatus .

More specifically the information processing apparatus stores for example registered external storage apparatus information in which information to identify an external server external storage apparatus such as a URI is recorded in a storage unit described later provided with the information processing apparatus . The registered external storage apparatus information is recorded in the storage unit described later in advance for example during manufacture or shipment from a factory. Then the information processing apparatus determines whether the external server acting as the acquisition source is registered based on the registered external storage apparatus information and information to identify the external server external storage apparatus acting as the acquisition source contained in the acquired application.

Registered external storage apparatus information according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to being stored in the storage unit described later provided with the information processing apparatus . For example registered external storage apparatus information may be stored in a predetermined storage location such as a removable external recording medium or the storage unit described later of an external apparatus connected via a network or directly . In the above case the information processing apparatus can determine whether the external server acting as the acquisition source is registered by acquiring the registered external storage apparatus information for example by downloading or reading the registered external storage apparatus information appropriately from the predetermined storage location.

A determination result when the above determination turns out that the external server is registered indicates that the acquired application is an application that is acquired from the external server storing applications whose safety has been verified and thus has no safety problem. Therefore if the above determination result is obtained in the registration determination processing the information processing apparatus executes the application acquired in processing execution processing of 4 described later.

As described above the information processing apparatus acquires an application from the external server for execution appropriately each time execution thereof is started. Even if some malfunction should be detected in an application stored in the external server recorded in registered external storage apparatus information the application is corrected appropriately or updated for example replaced by the external server . That is when the information processing apparatus acquires an application from the external server recorded in registered external storage apparatus information the information processing apparatus can execute the application appropriately updated. Thus the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of an application by executing the application based on a determination result indicating that the determination result has been acquired from the external server recorded in the registered external storage apparatus information.

A determination result when the above determination turns out that the external server is not registered indicates that the acquired application is not an application acquired from the external server storing applications whose safety has been verified. Then when the above determination result is obtained the information processing apparatus performs processing first execution determination processing of 3 described later.

Processing of the information processing apparatus when a determination result when the above determination turns out that the external server is not registered is obtained is not limited to the above example. When the above determination result is obtained the information processing apparatus may for example determine whether the acquired application is registered to selectively perform the processing first execution determination processing of 3 described later in accordance with the determination result.

More specifically for example the information processing apparatus stores registered application information indicating applications registered in the storage unit described later . The registered application information includes for example an ID for example a program ID or the like to identify an application. The information processing apparatus registers generates updates an application in the registered application information based on for example a user s operation. The information processing apparatus selects an application whose execution has been performed as a registration target application in the registered application information based on history information indicating that the application has been performed stored for example in the storage unit described later but the registration method in the registered application information is not limited to the above method.

If the acquired application is an application registered in the registered application information the information processing apparatus determines that the acquired application is registered. Then if the acquired application is not determined to be registered the information processing apparatus performs the processing first execution determination processing of 3 described later. If the acquired application is determined to be registered the information processing apparatus performs processing second execution determination processing of 4 described later.

As described above the information processing apparatus can selectively perform the processing first execution determination processing of 3 described later according to a determination based on the registered application information. Even in the above case the information processing apparatus does not execute the acquired application if safety thereof is not verified by the processing second execution determination processing of 4 described later. Thus even if the processing first execution determination processing of 3 described later is selectively performed the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of an application.

Registered application information according to an embodiment of the present invention is not necessarily stored in the storage unit described later provided with the information processing apparatus . For example the registered application information may be stored in a predetermined storage location such as a removable external recording medium or a storage unit not shown of an external apparatus connected via a network or directly . In the above case the information processing apparatus can determine whether the acquired application is registered by acquiring registered application information for example downloading or reading registered application information from the predetermined storage location appropriately.

If for example the external server acting as the acquisition source is not determined to be registered in the processing of 1 the information processing apparatus performs the first execution determination processing to determine whether to execute the acquired application based on a user s operation.

As shown in the information processing apparatus displays an image in which a message M and buttons B and B causing the user to make a selection are displayed on a display screen. It is needless to say that the execution confirmation screen displayed by the information processing apparatus for the first execution determination processing according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the example in .

The information processing apparatus performs the first execution determination processing based on for example a user s operation a pressing operation of a button B or a button B on an execution confirmation screen as shown for example in . More specifically if the user selects for example the button B shown in the information processing apparatus determines that execution of the acquired application is permitted and performs the processing second execution determination processing of 4 described later. If the user selects for example the button B shown in the information processing apparatus determines that execution of the acquired application is not permitted and does not execute an application acquired in processing execution processing of 5 described later.

As described above even if the user selects for example the button B shown in the information processing apparatus does not execute the acquired application if safety is not verified by the processing second execution determination processing of 4 described later. Thus even if the user of the information processing apparatus should not know that safety of the acquired application is verified the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of the application.

If it is determined that execution is permitted in the processing first execution determination processing of 3 the information processing apparatus performs for example processing of 4 1 and processing of 4 2 below.

The information processing apparatus performs communication concerning authentication to execute an application with the authentication server . More specifically the information processing apparatus transmits a safety information acquisition request to the authentication server . By transmitting the safety information acquisition request the information processing apparatus can acquire safety information from the authentication server . The information processing apparatus transmits a safety information acquisition request containing for example information of an ID to identify the acquired application or information of a URI indicating the acquisition source of the application to the authentication server but the safety information acquisition request transmitted by the information processing apparatus is not limited to the above example.

If for example authentication server information recording information to identify an authentication server is stored in the storage unit described later the information processing apparatus performs communication with the authentication server based on the authentication server information stored in the storage unit described later . The authentication server information according to an embodiment of the present invention includes for example a URI or IP address representing the authentication server .

If authentication server information is not stored for example in the storage unit described later the information processing apparatus performs communication with the external server external storage apparatus recorded in registered external storage apparatus information to acquire authentication server information from the external server . Then the information processing apparatus performs communication with the authentication server based on the authentication server information acquired from the external server recorded in the registered external storage apparatus information.

The registered external storage apparatus information is stored in advance for example during manufacture of the information processing apparatus . The external server registered in the registered external storage apparatus information is the external server that stores applications whose safety has been verified by the manufacturer of the information processing apparatus or the like. Thus causing a server side storage unit not shown of the external server registered in the registered external storage apparatus information to store authentication server information can more easily be realized than causing the external server not registered in the registered external storage apparatus information to store the authentication server information. This is because the external server registered in the registered external storage apparatus information is more likely to be managed by for example the manufacturer of the information processing apparatus or a person related to the manufacturer.

Thus even if the information processing apparatus does not store authentication server information in the storage unit not shown thereof the information processing apparatus can perform communication with the authentication server by acquiring the authentication server information from the external server recorded in the registered external storage apparatus information.

The information processing apparatus determines whether to execute an application based on safety information authentication result acquired from the authentication server by the processing of 4 1 .

More specifically if the safety information acquired from the authentication server indicates that execution of an application is not permitted the information processing apparatus determines that execution of the acquired application is not permitted. Then the information processing apparatus does not execute an application acquired in the processing execution processing of 5 described later based on the determination result in the second execution determination processing.

If the safety information acquired from the authentication server indicates that execution of an application is permitted the information processing apparatus determines that execution of the acquired application is permitted. Then the information processing apparatus executes the application acquired in the processing execution processing of 5 described later based on the determination result in the second execution determination processing.

The information processing apparatus selectively executes the acquired application based on the determination result of each piece of processing of the processing registration determination processing of 2 to the processing second execution determination processing of 4 .

More specifically if it is determined that the external server is registered in the processing registration determination processing of 2 or if a determination is made to execute an application in the processing second execution determination processing of 4 the information processing apparatus executes the acquired application. Then when execution of the application completes the information processing apparatus discards the application. Discarding of the application means for example to delete data concerning execution of the application. When an application is discarded the information processing apparatus may record for example information of a history indicating that the application has been executed in a recording medium such as the storage unit not shown .

If a determination is made not to execute an application in the processing first execution determination processing of 3 or the processing second execution determination processing of 4 the information processing apparatus does not execute the acquired application. Then the information processing apparatus discards the acquired application.

The information processing apparatus selectively executes the acquired application based on for example as described above the determination result of each piece of processing of the processing registration determination processing of 2 to the processing second execution determination processing of 4 .

The information processing apparatus executes an application acquired when it is determined in the processing registration determination processing of 2 that the external server is registered. If the above determination result is obtained in the processing of 2 the acquired application is highly likely to be an application without safety problem. Therefore the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of an application by executing an application acquired when it is determined that the external server is registered in the processing registration determination processing of 2 .

The information processing apparatus also executes an application acquired when a determination is made to execute the application in the processing second execution determination processing of 4 . If the above determination result is obtained in the processing of 4 the acquired application is indicated to be an application whose execution is permitted by the authentication server . The authentication server performs authentication concerning an application based on a database functioning as for example a black list in which applications whose problem with safety is identified are registered or as a white list in which applications whose safety is verified are registered .

Thus an application whose execution is permitted by the authentication server is highly likely an application without safety problem. Therefore the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of an application by executing an application acquired when it is determined that the external server is registered in the processing second execution determination processing of 4 .

If a determination is made not to execute an application in the processing first execution determination processing of 3 or in the processing second execution determination processing of 4 the information processing apparatus does not execute the acquired application. If the above determination result is obtained in the processing of 3 the acquired application is for example an application whose safety is not verified and also an application whose activation is not desired by the user. If the above determination result is obtained in the processing of 4 the acquired application is for example an application whose execution on the authentication server is not permitted. That is if a determination is made not to execute an application in the processing of 3 or in the processing of 4 the acquired application is highly likely to have a safety problem.

If a determination is made not to execute an application in the processing first execution determination processing of 3 or in the processing second execution determination processing of 4 the information processing apparatus does not execute the acquired application and thus can improve safety in execution of the application.

Therefore the information processing apparatus can improve safety in execution of application software executed by being acquired from an external apparatus each time execution of the application software is started by performing the processing acquisition processing of 1 to the processing execution processing of 5 .

By performing the processing acquisition processing of 1 to the processing execution processing of 5 the information processing apparatus can execute an application stored in the external server external storage apparatus more safely. The information processing apparatus can execute an application stored in the external server and whose safety has not been verified more safely. However when the information processing apparatus executes an application whose safety has not been verified it is difficult to assert that the possibility of an occurrence of malfunction caused by execution of the application for some reason in the information processing apparatus is zero.

Thus in addition to the processing acquisition processing of 1 to the processing execution processing of 5 the information processing apparatus may further have a function to selectively perform processing to cause transmission of report information indicating any problem concerning safety of an executed application to the authentication server .

The report information includes for example an ID to identify the application and the number to identify each problem that has arisen for example the number set by associating with the type of problem . Information of the number to identify the problem that has arisen regarding the report information is stored in for example the storage unit described later of the information processing apparatus during manufacture of the information processing apparatus but the time when the storage unit described later is caused to store information of the number to identify the problem that has arisen is not limited to the above example. For example the information processing apparatus may acquire information of the number to identify the problem that has arisen from the authentication server to store the information in the storage unit described later .

If for example the user selects an icon indicating an application whose execution has completed the information processing apparatus determines whether the external server acting as the acquisition source of the selected application is the external server registered in registered external storage apparatus information. Then if for example the external server acting as the acquisition source of the selected application is not registered in the registered external storage apparatus information the information processing apparatus selectively transmits report information to the authentication server based on for example a user s operation. The information processing apparatus can perform communication with the authentication server by using for example the same method as that of the processing communication processing concerning authentication to execute an application of 4 1 .

More specifically if for example the external server acting as the acquisition source of the selected application is not registered in the registered external storage apparatus information the information processing apparatus displays a report screen enabling transmission of report information by a user s operation on a display screen.

If the external server acting as the acquisition source of the selected application is not registered in the registered external storage apparatus information the information processing apparatus selectively causes the display screen to display the report screen as shown in but the report screen made to display by the information processing apparatus is not limited to the above example. If for example a malfunction is detected for example if an application terminates abnormally when an application is executed the information processing apparatus may selectively cause the display screen to display the report screen as shown in automatically.

As shown in the information processing apparatus displays an image in which a message M a selection means SEL for causing the user to select the type report content of problem that has arisen and a button B that triggers the start of transmission of report information are displayed in the display screen. There is a one to one correspondence between the type of problem displayed in the selection means SEL and information of the number of the problem that has arisen. It is needless to say that the report screen displayed by the information processing apparatus in report processing according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the example in .

The information processing apparatus selectively performs transmission of report information based on a user s operation a selection operation of the selection means SEL and a pressing operation of the button B on the report screen as shown for example in . More specifically if the user selects for example the button B shown in the information processing apparatus transmits report information corresponding to the type of problem selected by the selection means SEL displayed on the report screen to the authentication server . Though not shown in the information processing apparatus can also make a transmission that is no report information is transmitted from the report screen to another display screen based on a user s operation.

If the external server acting as the acquisition source of the selected application is registered in the registered external storage apparatus information the information processing apparatus displays for example an inquiry screen.

Referring to for example a widget name corresponding to the name of an application a provider name of the application and reference information are displayed on the inquiry screen. The user can make an inquiry by any method based on various kinds of information displayed on the inquiry screen.

The inquiry screen according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the example in . For example the information processing apparatus may display the inquiry screen in the same layout as that in to transmit report information to the corresponding external server based on a user s operation.

The information processing apparatus selectively causes for example as described above transmission of report information to the authentication server .
