title: Suppression of parasitic lasing
abstract: A laser gain medium crystal comprising a square rod of laser gain medium material having top and bottom surfaces that are finely ground to introduce scattering surfaces to cancel parasitic lasing. The square rod of laser gain material has input and output faces and side surfaces, and portions of the side surfaces near the output face of the square rod are finely ground to introduce scattering surfaces to cancel parasitic lasing. The rest of the side surfaces of the square rod are polished.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.

This invention relates in general to solid state lasers and more particularly to diode pumped solid state lasers.

Laser range finders and laser designators are becoming an increasingly vital component in high precision targeting engagements. The precise and accurate range to target information is an essential variable provided by laser range finders to precisely designate a target.

Unfortunately current fielded laser range finders and laser designators are bulky heavy and expensive. These laser range finders and laser designators were not developed with the individual user in mind.

It is therefore an object of this disclosure to make the development and fabrication of a very compact laser range finder or laser designator possible.

This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by a laser gain medium crystal comprising a square rod of laser gain medium material having top and bottom surfaces that are finely ground to introduce scattering surfaces to cancel parasitic lasing.

Another aspect of the invention involves a laser gain medium crystal comprising a square rod of laser gain medium material having input and output faces and side surfaces portions of the side surfaces near the output face of the square rod being finely ground to introduce scattering surfaces to cancel parasitic lasing.

Yet another aspect of the invention involves a method of making a laser gain medium crystal comprising the steps of providing a square rod of laser gain medium material having top and bottom surfaces and finely grinding the top and bottom surfaces of the square rod to introduce scattering surfaces to cancel parasitic lasing.

Size weight performance and production costs are parameters that benefit by this invention. The invention simplifies the producibility of a laser range finder or laser designator system. The fabrication of the laser gain medium crystals using the inventive method can be done using batch processing. Large rectangular laser optical components can be polished and properly coated. This batch process can greatly reduce the overall fabrication costs of the laser cavity. The inventive method is very simple. It can reduce the cost of processing the laser gain medium crystals by not requiring a fine polish and then having to try to suppress the parasitic lasing by adding additional cladding or labor intensive and expensive coatings.

The present invention may be used as the laser gain medium in very compact laser range finders and laser designators. The design of the inventive method also lends itself to placement in other laser based devices. These may be medical devices industrial tools or scientific equipment that would benefit from the size weight reduction dependable performance and low cost of the inventive method.

In operation the total internal reflecting concentrator block contains and directs pumping radiation from the external spatially extended stack of diode laser bars to the gain medium crystal to generate amplification in the gain medium and the mirrors provide optical feedback to sustain laser oscillation in the optical resonator. The Q switch prevents the laser cavity from resonating until the population inversion has built up fully resulting in pulsed operation of the laser cavity.

Referring to cancellation of parasitic or ghost lasing in the gain medium crystal is achieved by polishing the gain medium crystal on less than all sides in order to create rough scattering surfaces. For example the top and bottom of the gain medium crystal and portions of the sides near the output face may be finely ground.

In one exemplary embodiment a gain medium crystal as shown in can be a square rod e.g. 25 mm 5 mm 5 mm or alternatively 30 mm 5 mm 5 mm . For example the input and or output faces can have dimensions 5 mm 5 mm. Further the input surface can be flat and can have one or more of the following exemplary surface coating characteristics HR 1064 nm 99 1 deg HT 790 820 nm 97 40 deg S P polarizations Surface Figure lambda 10 633 nm Surface Roughness 40 deg 75 . These exemplary end surface characteristics are provided as examples and can vary to produce such gain medium crystal .

Further such an exemplary gain medium crystal can be a square rod of material e.g. 0.7 doped Nd YAG. In such an exemplary embodiment cancellation of parasitic or ghost lasing in the gain medium crystal can be achieved by polishing and or finely grinding the top surface the bottom surface and a portion of the two sides near the output face of the gain medium crystal . For example besides grinding the input and output faces the top and bottom of the gain medium crystal can also be fine ground. At least the side surfaces of the square rod can be polished. Portions of sides can be fine ground e.g. approximately 8 mm on the two sides from the output end. Tolerances for side dimensions can be 0.05 mm. Tolerance for the length can be between 0.2 to 0.0 mm.

It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described.
