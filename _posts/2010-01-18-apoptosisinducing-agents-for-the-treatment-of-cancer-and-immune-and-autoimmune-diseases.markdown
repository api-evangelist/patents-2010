The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuation. For examples see C. D. Jones M. Kaselj R. N. Salvatore W. J. le Noble 1998 63 2758 2760 and E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen. 1994 . New York N.Y. John Wiley Sons Inc.

Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties.

Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope labeled or enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C C N O P S F Cl and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of Bcl 2 inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl 2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann.

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmcokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non istopic compound.

Prodrugs are derivatives of an active drug designed to ameliorate some identified undesirable physical or biological property. The physical properties are usually solubility too much or not enough lipid or aqueous solubility or stability related while problematic biological properties include too rapid metabolism or poor bioavailability which itself may be related to a physicochemical property.

Prodrugs are usually prepared by a formation of ester hemi esters carbonate esters nitrate esters amides hydroxamic acids carbamates imines Mannich bases phosphates phosphate esters and enamines of the active drug b functionalizing the drug with azo glycoside peptide and ether functional groups c use of aminals hemi aminals polymers salts complexes phosphoramides acetals hemiacetals and ketal forms of the drug. For example see Andrejus Korolkovas s Essentials of Medicinal Chemistry John Wiley Interscience Publications John Wiley and Sons New York 1988 pp. 97 118 which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

Esters can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group by general methods known to persons skilled in the art. The typical reactions of these compounds are substitutions replacing one of the heteroatoms by another atom for example 

Amides can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either an amino group or a carboxy group in similar fashion. Esters can also react with amines or ammonia to form amides.

Another way to make amides from compounds of formula I is to heat carboxylic acids and amines together.

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity but rather impart increased stability and or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups 2 deoxynucleotide 2 OCH containing ribonucleotides 2 F ribonucleotides 2 methoxyethyl ribonucleotides combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double stranded siRNA dsRNA can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand blunt ends or asymmetric ends overhangs . The overhang of 1 2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and or the antisense strand as well as present on the 5 and or the 3 ends of a given strand. For example siRNAs targeting Mcl 1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT 263 i.e. N 4 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 5 5 dimethyl 1 cyclohex 1 en 1 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 morpholin 4 yl 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 trifluoromethyl sulfonyl benzenesulfonamide or ABT 737 i.e. N 4 4 4 chloro 1 1 biphenyl 2 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 dimethylamino 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 nitrobenzenesulfonamide in multiple tumor cell lines Tse et. al 2008 68 9 3421 and references therein .

Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF or C met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.

Electrospray mass spectra ESI MS were recorded on Finnigan SSQ7000 Finnigan Corp. San Jose Calif. in both positive and negative ion mode.

Peptides were synthesized with at most 250 mol preloaded Wang resin vessel on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer using 250 mol scale FASTMOC coupling cycles. Preloaded cartridges containing 1 mmol standard Fmoc amino acids except for the position of attachment of the fluorophore where 1 mmol Fmoc Lys Mtt OH was placed in the cartridge were used with conductivity feedback monitoring. N terminal acetylation was accomplished by using 1 mmol acetic acid in a cartridge under standard coupling conditions.

The resin from the synthesizer was washed thrice with dichloromethane and kept wet. 150 mL of 95 4 1 dichloromethane triisopropylsilane trifluoroacetic acid was flowed through the resin bed over 30 minutes. The mixture turned deep yellow then faded to pale yellow. 100 mL of N N dimethylformamide was flowed through the bed over 15 minutes. The resin was then washed thrice with N N dimethylformamide and filtered. Ninhydrin tests showed a strong signal for primary amine

The resin was treated with 2 equivalents 6 FAM NHS in 1 DIEA N N dimethylformamide and stirred or shaken at ambient temperature overnight. When complete the resin was drained washed thrice with N N dimethylformamide thrice with 1 DCM and 1 methanol and dried to provide an orange resin that was negative by ninhydrin test.

All preparative runs were run at 20 mL min with eluents as buffer A 0.1 TFA water and buffer B acetonitrile.

Analytical HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1200 series system with a diode array detector and a Hewlett Packard 1046A fluorescence detector running HPLC 3D CHEMSTATION software version A.03.04 Hewlett Packard. Palo Alto CA on a 4.6 250 mm YMC column packed with ODS AQ 5 m particles with a 120 pore size and eluted with one of the gradient methods listed below after preequilibrating at the starting conditions for 7 minutes. Eluents were buffer A 0.1 TFA water and buffer B acetonitrile. The flow rate for all gradients was 1 mL min.

Fmoc Rink amide MBHA resin was extended using the general peptide synthesis procedure to provide the protected resin bound peptide 1.020 g . The Mtt group was removed labeled with 6 FAM NHS and cleaved and deprotected as described hereinabove to provide the crude product as an orange solid 0.37 g . This product was purified by RP HPLC. Fractions across the main peak were tested by analytical RP HPLC and the pure fractions were isolated and lyophilized with the major peak providing the title compound 0.0802 g as a yellow solid MALDI MS m z 2137.1 M H .

The protected peptide was assembled on 0.25 mmol Fmoc Rink amide MBHA resin Novabiochem on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated peptide synthesizer running FASTMOC coupling cycles using pre loaded 1 mmol amino acid cartridges except for the fluorescein 6 FAM labeled lysine where 1 mmol Fmoc Lys 4 methyltrityl was weighed into the cartridge. The N terminal acetyl group was incorporated by putting 1 mmol acetic acid in a cartridge and coupling as described hereinabove. Selective removal of the 4 methyltrityl group was accomplished with a solution of 95 4 1 DCM TIS TFA v v v flowed through the resin over 15 minutes followed by quenching with a flow of dimethylformamide. Single isomer 6 carboxyfluorescein NHS was reacted with the lysine side chain in 1 DIEA in N N dimethylformamide and confirmed complete by ninhydrin testing. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and side chains deprotected by treating with 80 5 5 5 2.5 2.5 TFA water phenol thioanisole triisopropylsilane 3 6 dioxa 1 8 octanedithiol v v v v v v and the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with diethyl ether.

Representative compounds were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO starting at 50 M 2x starting concentration 10 DMSO and 10 L were transferred into a 384 well plate. Then 10 L of a protein probe antibody mix was added to each well at final concentrations listed in TABLE 1. The samples are then mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated for an additional 3 hours at room temperature. For each assay the probe antibody and protein probe antibody were included on each assay plate as negative and positive controls respectively. Fluorescence was measured on the ENVISION plate reader Perkin Elmer using a 340 35 nm excitation filter and 520 525 F Bak peptide and 495 510 nm Tb labeled anti Histidine antibody emission filters. Inhibition constants Ki are shown in TABLE 2 below and were determined using Wang s equation Wang Z. X. An Exact Mathematical Expression For Describing Competitive Binding Of Two Different Ligands To A Protein Molecule. FEBS Lett. 1995 360 111 4 .

The inhibition constant K is the dissociation constant of an enzyme inhibitor complex or a protein small molecule complex wherein the small molecule is inhibiting binding of one protein to another protein. So a large Kvalue indicates a low binding affinity and a small Kvalue indicates a high binding affinity.

The data in TABLE 2 shows inhibition constants for the inhibition of a Bak BH3 peptide probe to Bcl 2 protein and indicate that compounds according to the invention have high binding affinities for anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein. The compounds are therefore expected to have utility in treatment of diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein is expressed.

It is expected that because compounds having Formula I bind to Bcl 2 they would also have utility as binders to anti apoptotic proteins having close structural homology to Bcl 2 such as for example anti apoptotic Bcl X Bcl w Mcl 1 and Bfl 1 A1 proteins.
