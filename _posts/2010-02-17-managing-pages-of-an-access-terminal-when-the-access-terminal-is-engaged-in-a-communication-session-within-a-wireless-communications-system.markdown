Embodiments of the present invention are directed to managing pages of an access terminal when the access terminal is engaged in a communication session within a wireless communications system.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association Electronic Industries Association in TIA EIA IS 95 A entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System referred to herein as IS 95. Combined AMPS CDMA systems are described in TIA EIA Standard IS 98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT 2000 UM or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA WCDMA CDMA2000 such as CDMA2000 EV DO standards for example or TD SCDMA.

In wireless communication systems mobile stations handsets or access terminals AT receive signals from fixed position base stations also referred to as cell sites or cells that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network AN radio access network RAN which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force IETF based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service QoS requirements. Therefore the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol IP network data packets.

In wireless telecommunication systems Push to talk PTT capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a dispatch voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures such as CDMA FDMA TDMA GSM etc. In a dispatch model communication between endpoints ATs occurs within virtual groups wherein the voice of one talker is transmitted to one or more listeners. A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information such as group name or group identification.

Conventionally data packets within a wireless communications network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as unicast . As mobile communications have increased the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A broadcast refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given cell served by a given service provider etc. while a multicast refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example the given group of destinations or multicast group may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given group served by a given service provider etc. . However it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal similar to a unicast or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals e.g. within a cell or sector similar to a broadcast.

Broadcasts and or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group allocating a unique broadcast multicast channel BCH for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push to talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0049314 dated Mar. 1 2007 and entitled Push To Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x EVDO Cellular Network the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007 0049314 a broadcast channel can be used for push to talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and or delay and may degrade system performance.

The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 defines a broadcast multicast service BCMCS specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly a version of 3GPP2 s BCMCS specification entitled CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification dated Feb. 14 2006 Version 1.0 C.S0054 A is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS . An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller BSC and or packet control function PCF . Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.

The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network such as a corporate intranet or the Internet and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers.

The RAN controls messages typically sent as data packets sent to a base station controller packet control function BSC PCF . The BSC PCF is responsible for signaling establishing and tearing down bearer channels i.e. data channels between a packet data service node PDSN and the access terminals . If link layer encryption is enabled the BSC PCF also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC PCF is well known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network may communicate with the BSC PCF by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the BSC PCF may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the BSC PCF transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple base stations BS or modem pool transceivers MPT . In a similar manner to the carrier network the BSC PCF is typically connected to the MPT BS by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The MPT BS can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The MPT BS BSC PCF and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC PCF and one or more of the MPT BS may be collapsed into a single hybrid module having the functionality of both the BSC PCF and the MPT BS .

Referring to the broadcast serving node BSN may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN will be described in greater detail below. The BSN communicates with the RAN e.g. the BSC PCF via a broadcast BC A connection and with the application server via the Internet . The BCA connection is used to transfer multicast and or broadcast messaging. Accordingly the application server sends unicast messaging to the PDSN via the Internet and sends multicast messaging to the BSN via the Internet .

Generally as will be described in greater detail below the RAN transmits multicast messages received from the BSN via the BCA connection over a broadcast channel BCH of the air interface to one or more access terminals .

Referring to an access terminal here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the access terminal and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA WCDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device MPT BS and BSC PCF . The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network PSTN the Internet a virtual private network and the like thus allowing the access terminal access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

Further the primary and secondary antennas can be used in conjunction such that each antenna tunes to the same downlink transmission which permits the AT to take advantage of signal diversity so as to obtain a higher success rate for decoding the downlink messages than either antenna could achieve by itself as is known in the art. In an example the primary antenna or first antenna A may have a sensitivity approximately 3 decibels dB higher than the secondary antenna or second antenna B. Further while not illustrated explicitly in it is also possible that more than two 2 antennas could be attached to the AT . In this case there may be multiple primary antennas e.g. antennas having a higher sensitivity than at least one other antenna and or multiple secondary antennas e.g. antennas having a lower sensitivity than at least one other antenna . Also while the primary antenna A is illustrated as being physically larger than the secondary antenna B the physical size of the antennas need not actually be different so long as the tuning sensitivity of the antennas distinguish from each other such that at least one antenna can be classified as primary and at least one other antenna can be classified as secondary . With regard to reverse link transmissions the primary antenna is typically the exclusive antenna that is used for transmitting from the AT whereas the secondary antenna if present is used for monitoring downlink transmissions from the RAN .

While illustrated in as two antennas with one of the two antennas being a primary antenna and the other of the two antennas being a secondary antenna some ATs have antennas configurations that include more than two antennas. In this case the three or more antennas can be partitioned into antenna groupings or sets with one of the sets being a primary antenna set and the other of the sets being a secondary antenna set. In this case two or more antennas may be included in the primary antenna set and or the secondary antenna set such that the primary and secondary antenna sets are used together and the antenna set collectively has a higher sensitivity than the secondary antenna set. Thus when reference is made below to primary and secondary antennas it will be appreciated that these references can include designations of single antennas and or multiple antennas grouped into sets.

It is common for access terminals such as AT to monitor different types of wireless communication networks. For example AT can be configured to monitor data and or other messaging from a first network such as EV DO and can also be configured to monitor data and or other messaging from a second network such as CDMA2000 1x. Accordingly the manner in which the AT allocates the primary and secondary antennas to the different wireless communication networks can affect the AT s decoding performance for the different networks with a given network s transmission being decoded more successfully at AT if the primary antenna is allocated as compared to the secondary antenna.

It is common for access terminals such as AT to monitor different types of wireless communication networks. For example AT can be configured to monitor data and or other messaging from a first network such as EV DO and can also be configured to monitor data and or other messaging from a second network such as CDMA2000 1x. As discussed above with respect to the antenna of AT can include multiple antennas such as a primary antenna e.g. having a higher sensitivity and a secondary antenna e.g. having a lower sensitivity and can allocate the primary antenna substantially to the first network e.g. a higher priority network or a lower priority network with an active communication session and can allocate the secondary antenna substantially to the second network e.g. a lower priority network a higher priority network using both antennas a higher priority network when the primary antenna is being used for an active communication session on a lower priority network etc. . For example if AT is in coverage of both EV DO and CDMA2000 1x networks IP data sessions can be conducted via the EV DO network over at least the primary antenna. In another example if AT is engaged in a circuit switched 1x call over the CDMA2000 1x network the 1x call can be conducted over at least the primary antenna.

Typically ATs only include one antenna that can transmit data e.g. the primary antenna with other antennas e.g. the secondary antenna being configured only to receive downlink transmissions from the RAN . Alternatively the antenna of AT can include a single antenna with the single antenna switching between the first and second networks as necessary e.g. to monitor pages on each network when the AT is dormant etc. . Below embodiments are described as if the ATs include both primary and secondary antennas although it will be appreciated how these embodiments can be modified for the single antenna scenario.

In an example the first network e.g. EV DO may be associated with higher data rates than the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x . Accordingly when the first network is available ATs may prefer to establish Point to Point Protocol PPP sessions with the first network rather than the second network. PPP is a data link protocol commonly used to establish a direct connection between two networking nodes. As used herein establishing a PPP session over a given network means that a PPP connection has been established between the RAN and the AT for that particular network such that the RAN can simply page the AT and then begin sending data without additional call set up procedures. Establishing a PPP session does not necessarily mean that the AT is actually exchanging data with the RAN but rather has an IP data session established with the packet core infrastructure. For example the AT can establish a PPP session over the first and or the second network while still being in dormant mode. In dormant mode the AT monitors the first and or second networks for pages from the RAN but does not actually have a traffic channel TCH that is continuously monitored and or transmitted upon for data exchanges with the RAN .

While reference is generally made to PPP sessions throughout the description of the embodiments it will be appreciated that this particular term of art does not apply to every communication protocol and or infrastructure environment. The specific terminology of PPP session is not generally used in W CDMA for instance. The references to PPP sessions contained herein are not intended to limit the embodiments to protocols and or infrastructure environments that typically include this terminology however. Rather the PPP session could be representative of any type of IP data session even in protocols like W CDMA that would not typically refer to such sessions as PPP sessions. Further IP datasessions in CDMA i.e. PPP sessions are between the AT or UE and the PDSN with the RAN functioning as a conduit therebetween. In W CDMA the IP data sessions are established between the AT or UE and a Gateway General Packet Radio Service GPRS GGSN Support Node GGSN . Thus the endpoint for the IP data session e.g. PPP session in CDMA etc. can change when embodiments of the invention are implemented in different infrastructure and or protocol environments such that the PPP sessions referred to herein can correspond to any type of IP data session and the IP data session can be between the AT or UE and any packet core infrastructure component e.g. the PDSN in CDMA the GGSN in W CDMA etc. . Thus it will be appreciated that the embodiments can be modified to accommodate other types of communication protocols and or infrastructure environments aside from the implementations explicitly described herein.

Whenever an AT is dormant or does not have an active TCH for a current communication session on any monitored network the AT periodically wakes up and monitors a downlink control channel CCH or downlink paging channel PCH from the RAN within each network being monitored by the AT. Assuming that the AT is not being paged by the RAN the AT then goes back to sleep until waking up again to check whether the AT is being paged at a next paging cycle or until a user of the AT requests that data be sent to the RAN . It will be appreciated that the IP data session e.g. PPP session in CDMA can be set up irrespective of whether the AT has a TCH established with the RAN .

As will be described below in greater detail during an active communication session on either network e.g. either EV DO or CDMA2000 1x the AT can conventionally either continue to monitor both networks and interrupt the communication session if a page is received on the other network e.g. as in or alternatively can stop monitoring the other network altogether until after the communication session is over e.g. as in .

Accordingly illustrates a conventional communicative process wherein multiple networks are monitored when a given AT AT is engaged in a communication session on one of the networks. Referring to assume that AT is configured as AT such that AT includes both a primary and secondary antenna and further assume that AT has established a PPP session over the EV DO network. Below is described such that the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network whereas the first network corresponds to an EV DO network.

Accordingly referring to AT is in a dormant state such that AT periodically monitors the first network with at least AT s primary antenna e.g. and potentially with the secondary antenna as well for diversity to determine if AT is being paged by the first network and AT periodically monitors the second network with AT s secondary antenna to determine if AT is being paged by the second network A. As will be appreciated AT s use of the secondary antenna to monitor the second network assumes that the primary antenna is being used to monitor the first network because AT could otherwise use the un occupied primary antenna briefly in order to monitor the second network. Thus while AT can use the secondary antenna to monitor the second network it will be appreciated that there are times when this step is actually performed with the primary antenna e.g. when the first network is not using the primary antenna .

Next assume that AT sets up or joins a communication session e.g. a circuit switched communication session on the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x network A. During A while not shown explicitly within signaling messages can be exchanged between AT and the second network of the RAN to set up the communication session and AT can be allocated a TCH by the second network of the RAN for AT to use during the communication session.

After the communication session is setup in A assume that AT uses the primary antenna for the communication session on the second network e.g. as both a transmit antenna and a receive antenna and that AT also tunes its secondary antenna periodically to the first network to check for pages of AT by the first network e.g. EV DO A. Thereafter AT and the second network of the RAN exchange media and or in call signaling messages during the communication session A. While not shown in the media exchanged in A can be sent from to one or more other ATs participating with AT in the communication session.

Referring to during the communication session on the second network in A the application server which is responsible for arbitrating communication sessions e.g. VoIP sessions PTT sessions half duplex communication sessions full duplex communication sessions etc. on the first network e.g. EV DO determines whether to send data such as an announce message to AT A. For example the application server can determine to send an announce message to AT if a call originator not shown sends a call request to the application server that identifies AT as a target AT. In A assume that the application server determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT . Accordingly the application server forwards the data intended for AT to the first network of the RAN for transmission to AT A. The first network of the RAN receives the data intended for AT and determines to page AT A. Accordingly the first network of the RAN pages AT in each sector of AT s current subnet in A. In A the first network of the RAN knows the current serving RNC or BSC for AT and thereby is aware of AT s subnet but the first network of the RAN is not aware of AT s actual location within the subnet which is why the first network of the RAN blindly pages AT within all sectors of AT s expected subnet in A. For example in at least one embodiment the IP data packet intended for AT is routed to the PDSN using standard IP routing the PDSN has an A connection with AT s subnet e.g. RAN or RNC and the IP data packet is routed to the RAN or RNC over the A connection after which the RAN pages AT .

Because AT has continued to monitor for pages on the first network with its secondary antenna AT detects the page from the first network of the RAN A. Next in order to respond to the page from the first network of the RAN AT closes its connection on the second network e.g. tears down or releases its TCH and or QoS resource reservations of the RAN to permit AT to respond to the page A. In an example the communication session cannot continue while AT responds to the page because AT is assumed to have only one antenna e.g. the primary antenna that is configured to send reverse link transmissions. Accordingly AT responds to the page from the first network A and the first network of the RAN sends the data e.g. the call announcement message to AT A on a F TCH after a TCH with AT on the first network of the RAN is established.

With respect to it will be appreciated that during a communication session continuing to decode pages on networks upon which the communication session is not being supported can lead to interruptions of the communication session. Accordingly one conventional manner of reducing this problem of session interruption is to stop monitoring other networks altogether during the communication session as described next with respect to .

Accordingly referring to AT is in a dormant state in B which is characterized above with respect to A of . Next assume that AT sets up or joins a communication session e.g. a circuit switched communication session on the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x network B. During B while not shown explicitly within signaling messages can be exchanged between AT and the second network of the RAN to set up the communication session and AT can be allocated a TCH by the second network of the RAN for AT to use during the communication session.

After the communication session is setup in B assume that AT uses the primary antenna for the communication session on the second network e.g. as both a transmit antenna and a receive antenna and that AT stops monitoring the first network of the RAN to check for pages of AT by the first network e.g. EV DO B. In an example because AT need not use the secondary antenna to monitor the first network during the communication session on the second network AT has the option of using both the primary and secondary antennas for monitoring the communication session on the second network e.g. for diversity . Thereafter AT and the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x of the RAN exchange media and or in call signaling messages during the communication session B. While not shown in the media exchanged in B can be sent from to one or more other ATs participating with AT in the communication session.

Referring to during the communication session on the second network in B the application server which is responsible for arbitrating communication sessions e.g. VoIP sessions PTT sessions half duplex communication sessions full duplex communication sessions etc. on the first network e.g. EV DO determines whether to send data such as an announce message to AT B. For example the application server can determine to send an announce message to AT if a call originator not shown sends a call request to the application server that identifies AT as a target AT. In B assume that the application server determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT . Accordingly the application server forwards the data intended for AT to the first network of the RAN for transmission to AT B. The first network of the RAN receives the data intended for AT and determines to page AT B. Accordingly the first network of the RAN pages AT in each sector of AT s current subnet in B. In B the first network of the RAN knows the current serving RNC or BSC for AT and thereby is aware of AT s subnet but the first network of the RAN is not aware of AT s actual location within the subnet which is why the first network of the RAN blindly pages AT within all sectors of AT s expected subnet in B.

Because AT stops monitoring for pages on the first network with its secondary antenna during the communication session on the second network in B AT does not detect the page from the first network of the RAN B. Accordingly the page is not answered and AT continues the communication session on the second network. In B AT determines whether to end the communication session on the second network. For example AT can determine to end the communication session on the second network after a period of TCH inactivity or in response to an explicit command from a user of AT . If AT determines to continue the communication session on the second network in B the process returns to B and the communication session continues. Otherwise if AT determines to end the communication session on the second network in B AT closes its connection with the second network e.g. tears down or releases its TCH and or QoS resource reservations B and then resumes monitoring for pages on both the first and second networks B.

Conventionally when a page of an AT is missed as in B and B of the AT remains unaware that a call was missed as the page information does not contain the information of who the caller was e.g. phone etc. . AT only becomes aware that a call was missed if the call originator of the missed call is re directed to a voicemail server for leaving a voicemail message for AT and the caller indeed leaves a voicemail which can later be downloaded to AT . Thus while simply ignoring other networks during a communication session can reduce interruptions to the communication session problems related to missed call notifications from the ignored networks are introduced. This limitation is at least as important for multimedia data transfers due to the absence of voicemail like infrastructure for data applications.

Embodiments of the invention are directed to call handling procedures related to an AT engaged in a communication session when the RAN wishes to send data unrelated to the communication session to the AT. The data may be associated with the same network as the current communication session e.g. as discussed below with respect to or a different network e.g. as discussed below with respect to . While generally assume that the current communication session corresponds to a session carried over a CDMA2000 1x network and that the incoming data is associated with a EV DO network the embodiments described below are directed to scenarios where the current or active communication session can correspond to any network type e.g. EV DO or CDMA2000 1x and the incoming data unrelated to the communication can correspond to any network type e.g. EV DO or CDMA2000 1x .

Referring to A through A correspond substantially to B through B of and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity except to again note that in the second network need not be a CDMA2000 1x network and the first network need not be a EV DO network as in . In A after the application server determines that the data e.g. call announcement message intended for AT has not been successfully sent to AT e.g. because AT is not monitoring pages on the first network during its communication session on the second network the application server updates a missed call log associated with AT in order to store a record of the call attempt e.g. the record may include a time of the call attempt a calling party identifier a member list of a group associated with the call if the call corresponds to a group call etc. and also stores any un delivered multimedia data e.g. a voicemail SMS message MMS message etc. from the call originator associated with the call attempt for AT if necessary e.g. the un delivered multimedia data may be stored in association with the record of the call attempt in the missed call log . Of course it is also possible that no un delivered multimedia data e.g. a voicemail SMS message MMS message etc. was left by the call originator in which case the missed call log would still be updated by the application server but no un delivered multimedia data would be stored in associated with the call attempt. While illustrates a single call attempt it will be appreciated that the single call attempt is illustrated for convenience of explanation and multiple call attempts and or pages of AT by the first network may be attempted during the process of while AT conducts the communication session on the second network of the RAN . As used herein a communication session corresponds to a media exchange session whereby a traffic channel TCH is allocated to an AT in contrast with other types of sessions e.g. PPP sessions that can be established irrespective of whether an IP address and or TCH is actually allocated to the AT.

After AT determines to end the communication session on the second network of the RAN in A AT closes its connection with the second network e.g. tears down or releases its TCH and or QoS resource reservations A as in B of . At this point instead of simply resuming monitoring for pages on both the first and second networks as in B of AT establishes a connection to the first network of the RAN e.g. obtains a TCH and then sends a query A to the application server to request i any un delivered multimedia data e.g. a voicemail SMS message MMS message etc. left for AT that have not yet been downloaded or listened to by AT on the first network and or ii portions of the missed call log on the first network e.g. the last N calls in the missed call log all calls received since AT began the communication session on the second network other AT specific notifications that were missed such as Presence Updates Instant Message IM requests etc. . For example in A AT requests information e.g. un delivered multimedia data missed call records etc. related to any call attempts that were made on the first network during its communication session on the second network. Upon receiving the query from AT the application server sends AT i any new un delivered multimedia data if any and ii the requested portions of the missed call log. In an example the missed call log may include only a record of call attempts for which AT has not been previously notified. In a further example if the application server determines that no call attempts have been made to AT since the previous time AT was notified of call attempts the application server may send a message indicating that no new information related to call attempts is present. In an example while not shown explicitly in AT can take rate control criteria into account in conjunction with sending the query in A. For example AT can refrain from sending the query in A if the number of queries already sent by AT within a given period of time is above a threshold thereby reducing traffic in the system if AT is frequently sending queries to the application server .

Above has been described such that the first and second networks may each correspond to either of a CDMA2000 1x network or a EV DO network. Next a more specific implementation of is described where the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network followed by a implementation where the first network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and the second network corresponds to a EV DO network.

Accordingly in a first example assume that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and that AT has a PPP session on the EV DO network and is in a dormant mode. Referring to under these assumptions AT periodically monitors the EV DO network and the CDMA2000 1x network for potential pages of AT A and then sets up or joins a circuit switched communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network A. Upon setting up the communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network AT stops monitoring for pages on the EV DO network A. AT exchanges media with the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN and or in call signaling messages during the communication session A. The application server e.g. a EV DO server such as a multicast or group communications server determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT A and then requests that the EV DO network of the RAN send the data to AT A. The EV DO network at the RAN receives the data transmission request from the application server determines to page AT A and then pages AT in AT s current subnet A. AT ignores the page from the EV DO network because AT stopped monitoring the EV DO network A. The application server updates the missed call log to reflect that an unsuccessful call attempt was made for AT and also stores un delivered multimedia data for AT if necessary A. At some point AT determines to end the communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network A and AT closes its connection to the CDMA2000 1x network A. AT then queries the application server for information related to any call attempts for which AT may not have yet been notified A and AT receives the missed call log that indicates that AT missed at least one call and also potentially receives associated un delivered multimedia data A.

In a second example assume that the first network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and the second network corresponds to a EV DO network and that AT has a PPP session on the EV DO network and is in a dormant mode. Further assume that a 3G1x circuit services notification application CSNA is not supported by AT . Referring to under these assumptions AT periodically monitors the EV DO network and the CDMA2000 1x network for potential pages of AT A and then sets up or joins a unicast EV DO and or BCMCS i.e. multicast packet switched communication session e.g. VoIP a multicast session etc. on the EV DO network A. Upon setting up the communication session on the EV DO network AT stops monitoring for pages on the CDMA2000 1x network A. AT exchanges media with the EV DO network of the RAN and or in call signaling messages during the communication session A. The application server e.g. a Voicemail server a mobile switching center MSC in a 1x network architecture which is not IP based but initiates paging of ATs etc. determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT A and then requests that the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN send the data to AT A. The CDMA2000 1x network at the RAN receives the data transmission request from the application server determines to page AT A and then pages AT in AT s current subnet A. AT ignores the page from the CDMA2000 1x network because AT stopped monitoring the CDMA2000 1x network A. The application server updates the missed call log to reflect that an unsuccessful call attempt was made for AT and also stores un delivered multimedia data for AT if necessary A. At some point AT determines to end the communication session on the EV DO network A and AT closes its connection to the EV DO network A. As will be appreciated when AT closes its connection to the EV DO network in A AT can tear down its TCH that was used during the communication session but this connection closing is not intended to imply that AT necessarily ends its association with the EV DO network entirely. In other words AT need not remove its session state configuration e.g. its RLP configuration its MAC configuration etc. with the EV DO network to end its connection for the communication session on the EV DO network.

AT then queries the application server for information related to any call attempts for which AT may not have yet been notified A and AT receives the missed call log that indicates that AT missed at least one call and also potentially receives associated un delivered multimedia data A. As will be appreciated the application server in this example corresponds to any call server that handles CDMA2000 1x calls whereas the application server in the preceding example corresponded to a server configured to arbitrate calls over the EV DO network.

Above is described under the assumption that AT ignores any pages received from a network other than a network currently supporting a communication session with AT . Below is directed to an embodiment wherein AT continues to monitor for pages from networks other than a network hosting a current communication session for AT .

Referring to B through B correspond substantially to A through A of and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity except to again note that the second network need not be a CDMA2000 1x network and the first network need not be a EV DO network as in . In B after the first network pages AT AT detects the page on the first network as in A. However unlike A AT does not interrupt and or close the communication session on the second network in B. In other words AT does not answer the page on the first network in B so long as the communication session on the second network is ongoing. Rather in B AT stores a record that indicates that AT was paged by the first network and otherwise ignores the page from the first network at this time. In B AT determines whether to end the communication session on the second network.

In B after the application server determines that the data e.g. call announcement message intended for AT has not been successfully sent to AT e.g. because AT ignored the page from the first network in B the application server updates a missed call log for AT to store a record of the call attempt e.g. the record may include a time of the call attempt a calling party identifier a member list of a group associated with the call if the call corresponds to a group call etc. and also stores un delivered multimedia data from the call originator associated with the call attempt for AT if necessary e.g. the un delivered multimedia data may be stored in association with the record of the call attempt in the call log . B of generally corresponds to A of and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity.

After AT determines to end the communication session on the second network of the RAN in B AT closes its connection with the second network e.g. tears down or releases its TCH and or QoS resource reservations B as in A of . At this point instead of simply resuming monitoring for pages on both the first and second networks AT evaluates pages if any that were received from the first network during the communication session on the second network to determine whether to query the application server for information related to any call attempts that AT may have missed. In an example AT may interpret an indication that one or more pages were received from the first network as sufficient for sending a query to the application server to retrieve more detailed information regarding the missed call attempt. In an alternative example only certain pages may trigger a query for more information from AT . For example if the first network corresponds to a EV DO network supporting EV DO Rev. B protocols only pages that include high priority signaling and or media reservation labels may trigger the query from AT . In another example if the first network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network queries may only be triggered based on a Service Option relative to the EV DO communication session. In this example the 1x service option may correspond to a SMS message or a voice call. Lower priority messages thereby need not necessarily trigger the query.

Based on the page evaluation from B AT determines whether to query the application server for additional information related to any un answered pages during AT s communication session on the second network B. In an example while not shown explicitly in AT can take rate control criteria into account in conjunction with the query decision in B. For example AT can determine to refrain from sending the query in B if the number of queries already sent by AT within a given period of time is above a threshold thereby reducing traffic in the system if AT is frequently sending queries to the application server . If AT determines to query the application server for more information the process advances to A of and AT sends the query to the application server . Otherwise if AT determines not to query the application server for more information e.g. because no pages were received etc. AT resumes monitoring for pages on both the first and second networks B.

Above has been described such that the first and second networks may each correspond to either of a CDMA2000 1x network or a EV DO network. Next a more specific implementation of is described where the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network followed by a implementation where the first network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and the second network corresponds to a EV DO network.

Accordingly in a first example assume that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and that AT has a PPP session on the EV DO network and is in a dormant mode. Referring to under these assumptions AT periodically monitors the EV DO network and the CDMA2000 1x network for potential pages of AT B and then sets up or joins a circuit switched communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network B. Upon setting up the communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network AT continues to periodically monitor for pages on the EV DO network B. AT exchanges media with the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN and or in call signaling messages during the communication session B.

The application server e.g. a EV DO server such as a multicast or group communications server determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT B and then requests that the EV DO network of the RAN send the data to AT B. The EV DO network at the RAN receives the data transmission request from the application server determines to page AT B and then pages AT in AT s current subnet B. AT detects the page from the EV DO network because AT continued monitoring the EV DO network but AT does not respond to the page from the EV DO network B. The application server updates the call log to reflect that an unsuccessful call attempt was made for AT and also stores un delivered multimedia data for AT if necessary B.

At some point AT determines to end the communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network B and AT closes its connection to the CDMA2000 1x network B. AT evaluates page s received from the EV DO network during its communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network. In this example assume that a query is triggered if any page from the EV DO network is received during the CDMA2000 1x communication session. Accordingly the process of advances to A of and the application queries the application server for information related to any call attempts for which AT may not have yet been notified A and AT receives the missed call log that indicates information associated with AT s missed call s and also potentially receives associated un delivered multimedia data A.

In a second example assume that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and that AT has a PPP session on the EV DO network and is in a dormant mode. Further assume that a 3G1x circuit services notification application CSNA is not supported by AT . Referring to under these assumptions AT periodically monitors the EV DO network and the CDMA2000 1x network for potential pages of AT B and then sets up or joins an EV DO and or BCMCS packet switched communication session e.g. VoIP a multicast session etc. on the EV DO network B. Upon setting up the communication session on the EV DO network AT continues to periodically monitor for pages on the CDMA2000 1x network B. AT exchanges media with the EV DO of the RAN and or in call signaling messages during the communication session B. The application server e.g. a Voicemail server a mobile switching center MSC in a 1x network architecture which is not IP based but initiates paging of ATs etc. determines to send data e.g. a call announcement message to AT B and then requests that the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN send the data to AT B. The CDMA2000 1x network at the RAN receives the data transmission request from the application server determines to page AT B and then pages AT in AT s current subnet B. AT detects the page from the CDMA2000 1x network because AT continued monitoring the CDMA2000 1x network but AT does not respond to the page from the CDMA2000 1x network B. The application server updates the call log to reflect that an unsuccessful call attempt was made for AT and also stores un delivered multimedia data for AT if necessary B. At some point AT determines to end the communication session on the EV DO network B and AT closes its connection to the EV DO network B. AT evaluates page s received from the CDMA2000 1x network during its communication session on the EV DO network. In this example assume that a query is triggered if any page from the CDMA2000 1x network is received during the EV DO communication session. Accordingly the process of advances to A of and the application queries the application server for information related to any call attempts for which AT may not have yet been notified A and AT receives the missed call log that indicates information associated with AT s missed call s and also potentially receives associated un delivered multimedia data A.

Further each of show examples by which a query is sent from AT to the application server in the event that AT terminates its participation in the communication session. In an alternative example if an AT involuntarily loses network acquisition on the network supporting the communication session and thereafter re acquires the network this re acquisition may correspond to another trigger for the query aside a voluntary termination of the communication session.

Thus in this alternative example the determination in A of or B of correspond to an involuntary loss of network acquisition. After this point reacquisition of the network can occur in two different ways. In one example AT maintains its session state configuration e.g. its RLP configuration its MAC configuration etc. but loses its connection e.g. weak pilot signal errors in decoding packets etc. a previously serving base station for a period of time. Thereby reacquisition occurs when AT s packet decoding success rate increased or when the pilot signal strength increases without necessitating AT to re establish its session state information. In another example AT drops its session state configuration e.g. its RLP configuration its MAC configuration etc. when AT loses its connection e.g. weak pilot signal errors in decoding packets etc. to the previously serving base station for a period of time. Thereby reacquisition occurs when AT re enters a coverage area of the network and also re establishes its session state configuration with the network. Accordingly while generally show AT sending a query for information related to page attempts of a network other than the network supporting its current communication session in this embodiment AT can send the query upon re entry or re acquisition into the network that was previously supporting its communication session after an involuntary or voluntary drop out. In either case after the communication session is terminated e.g. voluntarily or involuntarily AT has the option of querying the application server for any missed information if AT can access a network by which to contact the application server .

Further each of show examples whereby the query in A is sent over the first network which is the same network upon which the failed page of AT occurred earlier in A A A of or B B B of . In another example this query need not be sent over the first network but could be sent on another network such as the second network. For example AT can build or set up a tunnel via one network e.g. the second network to communicate with the second network and or the application server even though this network is not typically in communication with the application server . For example if the second network corresponds to 1x and the first network correspond to EV DO SMS can be used to communicate with the application server over the 1x network e.g. to convey EV DO signaling application specific content such as Instant Messaging IMing a request for a Voicemail status at a store and forward application server etc. even if the AT is not in EV DO coverage and does not have an IP data session. For example the routing of the SMS from the AT to the application server can be achieved by SMS Gateway infrastructures. For instance an SMS message addressed by the AT to a particular shortcode ensures that the SMS is forwarded by a network operator s SMSC to the SMS Gateway. This SMS Gateway subsequently uses the shortcode which could be uniquely assigned for a specific application server complex to determine the application server as the destination for the SMS message. Such SMS Gateway also can perform protocol translation by converting the SMS information into an HTTP or SMPP based transaction when delivering data to the application server . This mechanism thereby enables communication between an AT that is using a circuit switched link to transmit data to an application server that is connected to a packet switched network.

Referring to A through A correspond substantially to B through B of and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In A the first network e.g. EV DO network of the RAN determines whether to page AT . For example while not shown in the determination of A can be in response to a request from the application server not shown to send data to AT . If the first network of the RAN determines to page AT in A the RAN sends a page to AT A.

After the first network pages AT AT detects the page on the first network because AT continues to monitor for pages on the first network while the communication session on the second network is ongoing A. In A instead of ignoring the page from the first network until after the communication session on the second network is over as in AT pauses the communication session on the second network i.e. puts the session on hold which means AT no longer decodes media received in associated with the communication session on the second network but AT does not close its connection and or tear down its call resources for the communication session on the second network either . After putting the communication session on the second network on hold AT responds to the page from the first network A. For example in A AT obtains a TCH on the first network of the RAN and then sends the page response on the R TCH. Upon receiving the page response from AT the RAN sends the data e.g. a call announcement to AT A on the F TCH. Based on the data e.g. call announcement received on the first network in A AT determines whether to switch to the communication session that was announced on the first network or resume the communication session on the second network A. If AT determines to resume the communication session on the second network in A the process returns to A and the TCH on the second network would again be monitored. Otherwise if AT determines to switch to the communication session on the first network in A AT s connection to the second network is closed e.g. AT tears down or releases its TCH and or QoS resource reservations A and AT sets up the communication session on the first network A.

The embodiment of described above includes a relatively blind paging of AT within an entire subnet at A because the first network of the RAN is not necessarily aware of a more precise location for AT within the subnet. However it will be appreciated that the second network of the RAN has access to a more detailed location for AT because the second network is supporting AT s communication session when the first network attempts to page AT in A. Accordingly includes additional signaling between the first and second networks of the RAN so that the first network can narrow the sectors for AT s expected location. further includes an aspect by which the call announcement is included within a signaling message on a downlink control channel such that AT need not be paged and obtain a TCH before evaluating whether to accept the call on the first network.

Accordingly illustrates a communicative process wherein a given AT AT is engaged in a communication session on a network and during the communication session the given AT continues to monitor other networks for potential pages in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Below is described such that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and the second network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and assumes that a PPP session has been established on the EV DO network for AT and that AT is in dormant mode. However it will be readily appreciated how the teachings in can be implemented within different network types for the first and second networks.

Referring to B through B correspond substantially to A through A of and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In B the first network e.g. EV DO network of the RAN determines whether to send data to AT . For example while not shown in the determination of B can be in response to a request from the application server not shown to send data to AT . If the first network of the RAN determines to send data to AT in B the RAN determines whether a location of AT is known to the first network within a given location range B. For example the given location range can be less than a subnet and can correspond to a relatively small group of sectors e.g. a current or relatively current active candidate and or neighbor sets for AT etc. . If the RAN knows AT s expected location is within a relatively small area the process advances directly to B.

Otherwise if the RAN is not aware of AT s location e.g. to a greater degree of precision greater than a threshold level such as greater or more precise than at a subnet level etc. then the first network e.g. EV DO of the RAN sends a message to the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x of the RAN for querying AT s location B. For example the message of B may be transferred from the first network e.g. EV DO to the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x via an A interface and may be configured to request the 1x SectorIDs that are part of the AT s active candidate and neighbor sets.

Because the second network is supporting a current communication session with AT it can be assumed that the second network e.g. a CDMA2000 1x network has access to the requested location information associated with AT . Thus the second network of the RAN sends the requested location information to the first network of the RAN B. Upon obtaining a reduced location area that is expected to include AT instead of paging AT the first network e.g. a EV DO network packages the data intended for AT within a signaling message e.g. a data over signaling DoS message and then sends the signaling message with the data over the downlink control channel in each sector that is expected to potentially include AT e.g. from the active candidate and neighbor sets of AT from the CDMA2000 1x network received in B . Packaging data such as announce messages within a DoS message for transmission over a control channel to a target AT is discussed in more detail within co pending U.S. Provisional application Ser. No. 12 212 462 entitled MULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM filed on Sep. 17 2008 assigned to the same assignee as the subject application and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In an example while in theory the DoS message including the call announcement could be transmitted on the downlink CCH within an entire subnet this significantly increases the load on the downlink CCH. By narrowing the expected location of AT based on the location information from the second network the downlink CCH can be used to carry the announce message without increasing the CCH load on all sectors of AT s subnet.

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art transmitting the data e.g. in this case the announce message over the control channel means that AT can evaluate the announced communication session without having to setup a TCH on the first network of the RAN . Thus in B AT decodes the call announcement message and determines whether to switch from AT s current communication session on the second network e.g. CDMA2000 1x to the announced communication session on the first network e.g. EV DO . If AT determines not to switch to the announced communication session on the first network in B the process returns to B and AT does not respond to the call announcement message i.e. no TCH with the first network is ever setup . Conventionally if AT were to reject a call announcement for a communication session AT would sent an announce ACK reject message. In this case however AT refrains from sending the announce ACK reject message because this could necessitate setup of a TCH for AT on the first network.

Otherwise if AT determines to switch to the announced communication session on the first network in B AT closes its connection to the second network of the RAN B and then sets up the communication session on the first network B e.g. by obtaining a TCH and sending an announce ACK accept message to the application server not shown in .

While not explicitly shown in or if the call announcement from A or B fails i.e. the call target does not respond and is not performed on a 1x network then the application server can send the call announcement via a PSTN gateway on the 1x network. In an example sending the call announcement on a 1x network in this manner can increase the success rate.

Above described embodiments of the invention have generally been directed to paging procedures related to how an AT participating in a communication session on a network can receive pages transmitted on another network. Alternatively the page from the other network e.g. EV DO can be tunneled and then transmitted to the target AT on its TCH for the network e.g. CDMA2000 1x supporting its current communication session as described next with respect to .

Referring to assume that the first network corresponds to a CDMA2000 1x network and the second network corresponds to a EV DO network and that AT has established a PPP session over the EV DO network and is currently operating in a dormant mode. Further assume that a 3G1x circuit services notification application CSNA is supported by AT . AT monitors for pages on both the first network e.g. CDMA2000 1x and the second network e.g. BCMCS and EV DO and then sets up a BCMCS packet switched communication session e.g. a multicast session etc. over the EV DO network e.g. specifically over an physical layer air interface portion of the EV DO network that is configured to support BCMCS sessions . At this point AT stops monitoring for pages on the CDMA2000 1x network possibly due to not being in 1x coverage as in A of . The CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN determines whether to page AT .

As discussed above the decision by the EV DO network as to whether to page AT can be based on whether an application server e.g. a Voicemail server not shown has requested the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN to send data to AT . If the CDMA2000 1x network of the RAN determines to page AT in instead of simply transmitting the page in AT s subnet on the CDMA2000 1x network the CDMA2000 1x network tunnels its page message to the EV DO network . For example if the CDMA2000 1x network determines that AT is engaged in a BCMCS communication session the CDMA2000 1x network at the RAN and the EV DO network can be configured to tunnel any 1x pages or SDBs via the A interface to the EV DO RAN which can then tunnel the page using the 3G CSNA protocol to the AT on the EV DO system.

The EVDO network upon receiving the 3G1x CSNA protocols to the EV DO network for transmission to AT in e.g. over an A interface that allows 1x messages to be sent to the EV DO network as explained in 3GPP2 A.S0008 C v2.0 section 2.8 whereby the A interface is used to pass 1x air interface signaling messages between the HRPD AN and the 18 standalone IWS or the IWS 1xBS . As will be appreciated CSNA is a protocol between the AT and the EVDO RAN and the A interface is a pipe for the 1x RAN to talk to the EV DO RAN and vice versa. Accordingly upon receiving the tunneled message from the CDMA2000 1x network in the EV DO network of the RAN transmits the CDMA2000 1x page message to AT over the Control Channel e.g. although in another embodiment even an EV DO traffic channel can be used .

While remaining in the BCMCS communication session on the EV DO network AT receives the CDMA2000 1x page message processes this message and determines whether to switch from the BCMCS communication session to the CDMA2000 1x network in order to answer the page and potentially join a communication session on the CDMA2000 1x network . In an example the decision of can be based in part on user preferences stored at AT such that AT does not necessarily have to wait for a user of AT to decide whether to switch sessions e.g. if the user of AT indicates that BCMCS sessions are preferred over CDMA2000 1x sessions then the page may be ignored automatically etc. . If AT determines not to switch to the CDMA2000 1x network the process returns to and the BCMCS session continues. Otherwise if AT determines to switch to the CDMA2000 1x network and answer the page AT closes its connection on the EV DO network e.g. tears down its TCH etc. although AT can potentially still maintain its session state configuration e.g. its RLP configuration its MAC configuration etc. on the EV DO network and then sets up the CDMA2000 1x session on the CDMA2000 1x network .

Alternatively the AT need not close its BCMCS session or its connection to the BCMCS network but rather can accept the 1x call simultaneously while being in the BCMCS call. Specifically AT can accept the 1x call voice call or SMS etc. by transmitting the page response using the 3G CSNA protocol that is transmitted either over the EV DO TCH or Access Channel. Once the call has been set up subsequent 1x circuit switched traffic in the call can be relayed via the A interface and the CSNA encapsulated packets over EV DO overhead Control Channel and Access Channels on Forward and Reverse Links or Traffic channels. Using enhancements to the existing BCMCS standards it is also possible to use unused slots on the BCMCS physical layer to communicate 3G CSNA information to AT .

Above described embodiments have generally been directed to paging procedures related to how an AT participating in a communication session on a network can receive pages transmitted on another network. Below an embodiment is described with respect to related to how a network can page an AT to announce a different communication session on the same network.

Referring to in a first example assume that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and that AT has established a PPP session over the EV DO network and is operating in a dormant mode. AT monitors for pages on the first network e.g. EV DO . Next assume that AT sets up a communication session of a first air interface on the EV DO network . In this example the communication session of the first air interface corresponds to a BCMCS packet switched call. Accordingly after setting up the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network AT exchanges media and or in call signaling messages with the EV DO network which can be related to or from other AT s participating in the session . In the application server that is responsible for arbitrating communication sessions over the EV DO network determines to announce a communication session of a second air interface to AT . In this example the communication session of the second air interface corresponds to a unicast session instead of a BCMCS session.

Accordingly the application server sends the announce message for the communication session of the second air interface to the RAN and the EV DO network of the RAN transmits the announce message to AT e.g. on a F TCH for AT s current communication session of the first air interface . AT receives the announce message and determines either to maintain its current communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network or to switch to the newly announced communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network . If AT determines to maintain the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network in the process returns to and the communication session of the first air interface continues. Otherwise if AT determines to switch from the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network to the communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network in AT sets up the communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network .

In an example AT can maintain its call resources e.g. QoS TCH etc. from the communication session of the first air interface upon switching to the communication session of the second air interface because the switch occurs on the same network e.g. the EV DO network . In other words these call resources need not be torn down and set up again during the switch. Further AT may be capable of tuning to both the downlink BCH and its unicast TCH concurrently such that if a BCMCS call is concurrent with a unicast call the user can switch back to the BCMCS call on the downlink BCH without sending an explicit accept message e.g. from the perspective of the RAN and application server this means that AT was presumed to have been an active listener to the BCMCS call even while AT was participating in the unicast call .

Referring to in a second example assume that the first network corresponds to a EV DO network and that AT has established a PPP session over the EV DO network and is operating in a dormant mode. AT monitors for pages on the first network e.g. EV DO . Next assume that AT sets up a communication session of a first air interface on the EV DO network . In this example the communication session of the first air interface corresponds to a EV DO packet switched unicast call. Accordingly after setting up the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network AT exchanges media and or in call signaling messages with the EV DO network which can be related to or from another AT participating in the session . In the application server that is responsible for arbitrating communication sessions over the EV DO network determines to announce a communication session of a second air interface to AT . In this example the communication session of the second air interface corresponds to a multicast session supporting by BCMCS protocols. Accordingly the application server sends the announce message for the communication session of the second air interface to the RAN and the EV DO network of the RAN transmits the announce message to AT e.g. on a F TCH for AT s current communication session of the first air interface . AT receives the announce message and determines either to maintain its current communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network or to switch to the newly announced multicast communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network . If AT determines to maintain the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network in the process returns to and the communication session of the first air interface continues. Otherwise if AT determines to switch from the communication session of the first air interface on the EV DO network to the communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network in AT sets up the communication session of the second air interface on the EV DO network . As noted above AT can maintain its call resources e.g. QoS TCH etc. from the communication session of the first air interface upon switching to the communication session of the second air interface because the switch occurs on the same network e.g. the EV DO network . In other words these call resources need not be torn down and set up again during the switch.
